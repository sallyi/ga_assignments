Zach Review

Expectations:

Read everything they wrote!
If they provided their data, review it and try to understand it.
Read their code and try to understand their thought process.
If their code can be run, try running it.
Spend at least one hour reviewing their project (including the time it takes to write the feedback).
Your feedback would ideally consist of:

Strengths of their project (things you particularly like about it)
Comments about things you think could be improved
Questions about things you don't understand
Comments about their code
Suggestions for next steps
Guiding principle: Give feedback that would be helpful to you if it was your project!
