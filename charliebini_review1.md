## Charlie's Project 1
[Charlie's Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cbini/datascience/blob/master/projects/ST%20Math%20Analysis.ipynb)

Overall comments
* A really nice intro, helps contextualize the problem really well.
* The Data definitions chat looks good and is very helpful.
* Also really like your conclusions. It's overall a very well thought-out project and will be really cool to say something definitive about the impact of this software on education.

Things to consider
* You wrote that you removed the students that did not log any time in the application. I think it might be hard to measure the true impact of using the software if you don't also consider the performance of the students who did not use it (as sort of a control group). Otherwise you can't really separate the effect of the ST math application on mathematical ability from the effect of just general day-to-day education.
* We talked about how you expected the SGP scores to fall into a normal distribution. Perhaps if you added the non-users back into the population, the SGP score distribution would appear more normal. The way the distribution appears now might suggest that its either the underperformers (those who really need the help) or the overachievers/high-performers are using the app. This is interesting in itself, and may be indicative of the type of students who are (and are not) using the app.
* It would be cool to compare the non-user SGPs over the course of the year to the user's SGPs. It would be interesting to see some other features, like socio-economic data, special programs the students are enrolled in, whether or not their teacher is pushing app usage,s etc., but I'm not sure how much data you have access to.
