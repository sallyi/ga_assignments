        "So ingenious in concept, design and execution that you could watch it on a postage stamp-sized screen and still be engulfed by its charm.\n",
        "The year's most inventive comedy.\n",
        "A winning animated feature that has something for everyone on the age spectrum.\n",
        "The film sports a provocative and appealing story that's every bit the equal of this technical achievement.\n",
        "An entertaining computer-generated, hyperrealist animation feature (1995) that's also in effect a toy catalog.\n",
        "As Lion King did before it, Toy Story revived the art of American children's animation, and ushered in a set of smart movies that entertained children and their parents. It's a landmark movie, and doesn't get old with frequent repetition.\n",
        "The film will probably be more fully appreciated by adults, who'll love the snappy, knowing verbal gags, the vivid, deftly defined characters, and the overall conceptual sophistication.\n",
        "Children will enjoy a new take on the irresistible idea of toys coming to life. Adults will marvel at a witty script and utterly brilliant anthropomorphism.\n",
        "Although its computer-generated imagery is impressive, the major surprise of this bright foray into a new kind of animation is how much cleverness has been invested in story and dialogue.\n",
        "How perfect that two of the most popular funny guys around, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, speak for the lead boy-toys.\n",
        "The result is a visionary roller-coaster ride of a movie.\n",
        "Disney's witty, wondrously imaginative, all-computer-generated cartoon is far and away the best of the new holiday movies in town.\n",
        "Disney's first computer-made animated feature is a 3-D eye popper.\n",
        "The script, by Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft, is filled with clever gags that keep the two heroes at each other's throats and the plot on fast- forward.\n",
        "The one big negative about Toy Story involves Disney's overcommercialization.\n",
        "Technically, Toy Story is nearly flawless.\n",
        "It's a nice change of pace to see the studio draw magic from this modern tale about ordinary 20th-century kid Andy and his eager-to-please playthings.\n",
        "I can hardly imagine having more fun at the movies than I did at Toy Story, the miraculous new Disney feature that's the first full-length animated film to be produced entirely on computer.\n",
        "The great voice acting, the visual puns, all added up to an animation game changer.\n",
        "A gloomy special-effects extravaganza filled with grotesque images, generating fear and despair.\n",
        "A calculated but very entertaining special effects extravaganza.\n",
        "Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are awfully good at this sort of thing.\n",
        "Mediocre, regrettably.\n",
        "Just don't expect their bickering to be on the level of Neil Simon, and you won't be disappointed.\n",
        "While it won't come close to my top 10 best list for 1993, it will be right up there among the pictures that I had the most fun watching.\n",
        "The movie is too pat and practiced to really be convincing, and the progress of Ariel's relationships with the two grumps seems dictated mostly by the needs of the screenplay.\n",
        "If you poke through Grumpy's cheap sentimentality, you'll find a worthy picture somewhere.\n",
        "Never escapes the queasy aura of Melrose Place: just another story about beautiful people with small problems.\n",
        "A pleasant if undemanding piece of work that is diverting to sit through though it won't stand up to any kind of rigorous examination.\n",
        "You want the movie to stomp and rejoice and cry like a fool; instead it meanders and lollygags, occasionally flaring up, then sputtering again.\n",
        "This sister-celebratory adaptation of Terry McMillan's best-selling book is frequently delightful.\n",
        "The male-bashing taken to an extreme in Waiting to Exhale is starting to seem a little like crack for the female psyche, exhilarating in the short term but ultimately crippling and dangerous.\n",
        "Whitaker clumsily mishandles what should be a 'you go, girl!' tour de force.\n",
        "For all the pleasure there is in seeing effective, great-looking black women grappling with major life issues on screen, Waiting to Exhale is an uneven piece.\n",
        "With the exception of Bernadine, I never felt anything for the women populating this film, as they failed to capture my interest or sympathy.\n",
        "An escapist fantasy that women in the audience can enjoy by musing, 'I wish I had her problems' - and her car, house, wardrobe, figure and men, even wrong men.\n",
        "Martin, Keaton and cinematographer William A. Fraker put this retro fluff over better than expected early on, but hour 2 is only for those who don't want their equilibriums rattled by surprises.\n",
        "When Pacino's loud, bruised cop and De Niro's canny crook stare at each other, you can read something spent and weary in their eyes and voices. The heat is hell. So are their jobs -- but somebody's got to do them.\n",
        "The taciturn De Niro and the braying Pacino share a flawless scene over a cup of coffee, but the real honors go to Val Kilmer and Ashley Judd as a warring, loving couple.\n",
        "So why doesn't Heat, with its elaborately staged, tautly edited robberies, its killer cast, edgy score and elegant cinematography, offer more satisfaction? It's the script, stupid.\n",
        "Just when it seemed that the only hope for crime movies lay in the postmodernist artifice of films like Pulp Fiction, Mann reinvests the genre with brooding, modernist conviction. This one sticks to your gut.\n",
        "There's nothing really new in this lengthy 1995 thriller by writer-director Michael Mann about cops and robbers in Los Angeles, but it has craft, pacing, and an overall sense of proportion, three pretty rare classic virtues nowadays.\n",
        "An odd though often entertaining blend of The Asphalt Jungle and Oprah, a traditional cops-and-robbers story weirdly fitted out with long, earnest discussions of interpersonal relationships.\n",
        "There isn't much going on at this party other than what the actors bring to it. But fortunately, Mann has invited some exceptional ones.\n",
        "Heat becomes consistently more interesting as it forges on toward the 180-minute mark.\n",
        "Heat occupies an exalted position among the countless contemporary crime films.\n",
        "Robert De Niro's last great role before he devoted himself to self-parody.\n",
        "This is simply the best American crime movie -- and indeed, one of the finest movies, period -- in over a decade.\n",
        "As Heat progresses, its sensational looks pale beside storytelling weaknesses that expose the more soulless aspects of this cat-and-mouse crime tale.\n",
        "Michael Mann and a superlative cast have taken a classic heist movie rife with familiar genre elements and turned it into a sleek, accomplished piece of work, meticulously controlled and completely involving.\n",
        "All the squealing tires, flying bullets and falling bodies cannot save Heat from drowning in its own banalities.\n",
        "Michael Mann's writing and direction elevate this material. It's not just an action picture.\n",
        "... a colossal disappointment.\n",
        "Heat generates lots of energy but gives off little light.\n",
        "Boosters and touts use the term 'major movie' so often that it's more likely to generate yawns than excitement at this point. Back to basics. Heat is a major movie. With major stars. Doing major acting.\n",
        "This is the first time De Niro and Pacino have acted together, and each gives a strong, watertight performance.\n",
        "The cop/ crime stuff that makes up the bulk of the movie is well thought out and well directed.\n",
        "This is never less than glittering entertainment, but somehow a certain measure of lead has found its way into the formula.\n",
        "Script is long on glibly quipping dialog, dropped with a seemingly casual air, and broadly played situations. The splendid trouping delivers them style. Leavening the chuckles are tugs at the heart.\n",
        "Wilder's tastelessness now seems his major artistic strength.\n",
        "It's a Cinderella story that gets turned on its head, a satire about breaking down class and emotional barriers, and a confrontation between New World callousness and Old World humanity.\n",
        "Hampered by an unimaginative script ... nevertheless manages to be a thoroughly charming, delightfully romantic variation of the Cinderella story.\n",
        "It is a story as light as a feather and as old as yesterday's news, as transparent as a society column item and as smug as a foreign-made car. But Mr. Wilder...has made it into a commentary as crisp as a screed in a smart magazine.\n",
        "A joyless lump.\n",
        "Reuniting Hyams and Van Damme, director and star of Timecop, this spectacular nail-biter exploits their combined, if limited, abilities to the full.\n",
        "Offers above-average pyrotechnics, a body count that steadily mounts, and plenty of hand-to-hand combat.\n",
        "Sudden Death is one of the best action thrillers of 1995. It's also the film Jean-Claude Van Damme has been building up to for 10 years.\n",
        "Despite the elaborate stunts, go-go-go direction from Peter Hyams, plus butt-kicking and surprise goalie action from Van Damme, Death deserves the hockey-puck booby prize for...getting its jollies by putting kids in jeopardy.\n",
        "A treat for Jean-Claude Van Damme fans, a superior action thriller loaded with jaw-dropping stunts and special effects, and strong in production values.\n",
        "Sudden Death isn't about common sense. It's about the manipulation of action and special-effects sequences to create a thriller effect, and at that it's pretty good.\n",
        "Though the climactic duel atop the arena roof is patently absurd, it's also exciting as events go into sudden-death overtime, just like the game being played below.\n",
        "Van Damme races against time, trying to thwart Boothe and defuse all the bombs. But in the hands of director Peter Hyams, these are just banal action-movie chores.\n",
        "About the best thing that can be said about this movie is that the action scenes, directed by Peter Hyams, are choreographed with flair. Unfortunately, the material connecting them is worthless.\n",
        "Brosnan, however, looks set to stay. He'll never recapture the amused cool of the young Sean Connery, but he does overcome the handicap of looking like a humorless male model.\n",
        "I don't know whether the Bond series has a future, but if Xenia Onatopp ever returns to try for world domination, he may finally get a battle worth fighting.\n",
        "There's something a mite pathetic about our culture still clinging to 007, but it's hard to deny that this is one of the most entertaining entries in the Bond cycle.\n",
        "Richard Kiel, you are missed.\n",
        "Among the better of the 17 Bonds and, perhaps more important for today's audience, a dynamic action entry in its own right, this first 007 adventure in six years breathes fresh creative and commercial life into the 33-year-old series.\n",
        "Director Campbell keeps matters bowling along and even manages to recapture something of the look of the earlier films.\n",
        "Suffers the blahs.\n",
        "Supercharged with spectacular, thundering, brain-numbing fun.\n",
        "They have given James a new car here, but it's the same old vanity plate, the one that should read: Je Me Souviens.\n",
        "A reasonable facsimile more than any kind of original, and it's hard not to feel a certain weariness while watching it unfold.\n",
        "It's BS -- Babes and Stunts -- and that's where GoldenEye excels.\n",
        "Directed with top-dollar proficiency (and some real wit).\n",
        "Perhaps the best entry in the series since The Spy Who Loved Me.\n",
        "Watching the film, I got caught up in the special effects and the neat stunts, and I observed with a certain satisfaction Bond's belated entry into a more modern world.\n",
        "Part romantic comedy, part Capra-corny political drama, this movie exudes so much sympathy, it sweats.\n",
        "With great looks, a dandy supporting cast, a zinger-filled screenplay by Aaron Sorkin and Mr. Douglas twinkling merrily in the Oval Office, The American President is sunny enough to make the real Presidency pale by comparison.\n",
        "Genial and entertaining if not notably inspired.\n",
        "Genial middlebrow fare that coasts a long way on the charm of its two stars.\n",
        "As bustling and impassioned as the best Sturges and Capra movies.\n",
        "Neither bad nor unwatchable, The American President is nevertheless the second straight disappointment from director Rob Reiner.\n",
        "You can't dislike this movie, but you won't be swept away by it either.\n",
        "The American President will make you laugh and make you smile. But it probably won't make you change your vote.\n",
        "Apart from its too-obvious political bias, The American President has romance in its heart, smarts in abundance and class to spare.\n",
        "Great entertainment.\n",
        "A well-modulated charmer.\n",
        "The American President becomes a pretty darn entertaining and affecting movie after its first simpering 20 minutes.\n",
        "Frothy.\n",
        "'Capraesque' has inevitably been affixed to The American President, but that phrase, with its implications of facile hokum, doesn't do the film justice.\n",
        "Painless fun.\n",
        "A super cast injects it with Teddy Roosevelt vitality.\n",
        "When it comes right down to it, high office does not guarantee high comedy.\n",
        "The image of a chief executive as moonstruck single guy taps something buoyant and touching in our collective democratic imagination. And Douglas, wearing a fast-break smile in place of his usual frown, strikes a tender rapport with Bening...\n",
        "Either this is the lamest Mel Brooks comedy ever or it's too close to other contenders to make much difference.\n",
        "The only real sparks are set off by MacNicol as Renfield, the solicitor who develops a taste for flies and spiders after being bitten by Dracula.\n",
        "Brooks, as Van Helsing, is one of the more successful aspects, but he hasn't imbued in his stock company a similar ability to rise above their underwritten roles.\n",
        "Slight but amusing.\n",
        "Not to venture forth some sort of radical idea, but aren't comedies supposed to have jokes?\n",
        "It's a toothless parody that misses more often than it hits.\n",
        "This time, unfortunately, he's sucking on a dry vein.\n",
        "If any movie proves that Mel Brooks' genius for skewering creaky genres has evaporated, it's this anemic attempt to draw new blood from low-flying vampire high jinks.\n",
        "Dracula is anemic and mediocre, with only one or two moments to remind you of the former, funnier Brooks.\n",
        "Nielsen makes a dapper and calmly inept Dracula, but it's Brooks' irrepressible and oblivious Van Helsing who's the main attraction.\n",
        "The love story is pure mush, not helped by the bland voice work done by Kevin Bacon as Balto and Bridget Fonda as dainty husky Jenna.\n",
        "As wayward and self-regarding as its subject, the film long overstays its welcome.\n",
        "What it finally adds up to is a huge mixed bag of waxworks and daring, a film that is furiously ambitious even when it goes flat, and startling even when it settles for eerie, movie-of-the-week mimicry.\n",
        "Without question, Nixon dwarfs everything in the American cinema since Schindler's List.\n",
        "Nixon starts, like a horror movie, on a dark and stormy night, with the president prowling around a room of the White House like Dracula in his lair.\n",
        "Nixon far overstays its welcome with an increasingly tedious final hour devoted largely to slogging through the minutiae of Watergate.\n",
        "Factual or not, there's no denying that Nixon has moments when it is nothing short of compelling.\n",
        "There's no compelling structure or viewpoint to hold the picture together.\n",
        "The problem here isn't accuracy. It's absurdity.\n",
        "Thoughts of Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear come to mind; here, again, is a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws. There's something almost majestic about the process: As Nixon goes down in this film, there is no gloating, but a watery sigh, as of a great ship\n",
        "Thoughtful, well-researched and carefully modulated, the film also marks director Oliver Stone's coming of age.\n",
        "You will not be bored.\n",
        "The picture is a case study.\n",
        "Casting Anthony Hopkins was a stroke of unexpected genius.\n",
        "Stone's no Shakespeare, and neither are his screenwriters.\n",
        "Joan Allen goes beyond her chilling physical resemblance to Pat Nixon toward serious Oscar worthiness.\n",
        "I never felt that I was seeing the darkness reaching out to the darkness as Nixon was once described.\n",
        "Real life, if it's real Nixon, is more dramatic than an Oliver Stone movie.\n",
        "What seemed like a dubious proposition on paper plays even more dubiously onscreen, as \"Cutthroat Island\" strenuously but vainly attempts to revive the thrills of old-fashioned pirate pictures.\n",
        "In this $90m revisionist swashbuckler, we get Geena Davis doing the all-action honours, and a hotchpotch script that seems to think pirate movies are so funny in themselves the need for more humour is superfluous.\n",
        "t's not possible to believe that Ms. Davis is the highly respected captain of a pirate ship, and it's not even fun to try.\n",
        "If the sight of half-naked, tattooed sailors firing cannons at each other shivers your timbers, climb aboard. Even passable pirate movies don't sail by every day.\n",
        "It takes a two-hour act of will to keep facing the screen during this moribund movie.\n",
        "[Stone] seems to be trying to enter a more passionate movie, where a neurotic gold digger could at least have a good time. By the end of Casino, for all its craftsmanly bravura, you may want to join her.\n",
        "So long as Casino stays focused on the excesses -- of language, of violence, of ambition -- in the life-styles of the rich and infamous, it remains a smart, knowing, if often repetitive, spectacle.\n",
        "Simultaneously quite watchable and passionless.\n",
        "Martin Scorsese's intimate epic about money, sex and brute force is a grandly conceived study of what happens to goodfellas from the mean streets when they outstrip their wildest dreams and achieve the pinnacle of wealth and power.\n",
        "It's not the actors' fault that no one is able to break through the film's gorgeous but chilly surface. You watch Casino with respect and appreciation, reveling in its documentary sense of detail.\n",
        "Scorsese may be flailing here, but Scorsese flailing is more formidable than most directors at the top of their form.\n",
        "The result, sadly, is that contradiction in terms, a dull Scorsese movie.\n",
        "Of all the bravura visual effects in Martin Scorsese's dazzlingly stylish Casino, it's a glimpse of ordinary people that delivers the greatest jolt.\n",
        "It's an ambitious film, but also a scattered, unfocused one.\n",
        "Visually impressive, splendidly performed, thematically significant, this is a movie in full possession of every key cinematic asset except one -- a solid script.\n",
        "[A] Vegas masterpiece.\n",
        "Martin Scorsese is a master filmmaker, so skilled in the manipulation of imagery he might be the most proficient of active American directors.\n",
        "After coming out gangbusters in its first and finest hour, the 180-minute movie loses all its chips in the remaining two.\n",
        "Martin Scorsese's fascinating new film Casino knows a lot about the Mafia's relationship with Las Vegas.\n",
        "In every way -- from the fantastic sets, rich dialogue, and unapologetic violence to the well-portrayed characters and themes of loyalty and betrayal -- Casino is pure Scorsese.\n",
        "Whether you find it exhilarating, expendable or exhausting -- and you will find it exhausting -- Martin Scorsese's Casino is the spectacular last word on urban sprawl.\n",
        "Thompson's script manages the neat trick of preserving the necessary niceties and decorum of civilized behavior of the time while still cutting to the dramatic quick.\n",
        "I can't say I remembered this 1995 feature too clearly a couple of days later; but I certainly had a good time as I watched it.\n",
        "Thompson and Winslet give fine performances ably supported by the rest of the ensemble.\n",
        "We need no further proof that this material is ageless.\n",
        "The sensibility may be a bit off, but there is more than enough sense involved in this mid-Atlantic Austen to make up the difference.\n",
        "The film is packed with pleasing performances by stage-trained actors.\n",
        "Told with deft skill and a pleasantly humorous romantic touch.\n",
        "It's bliss.\n",
        "A triumph for Taiwan's most famous director, Ang Lee.\n",
        "Thompson's script hits its peak by keeping Austen's voice yet finding the satirical smirk behind it.\n",
        "Sense and Sensibility is funny, expansive, and a delight to spend company with.\n",
        "The movie is good fun, boasting a dozen vivid characters and two that moviegoers will take to heart.\n",
        "Sense and Sensibility is an enjoyable film, and yet it left me somehow unsatisfied.\n",
        "Demonstrates how little humankind has evolved in matters of the heart.\n",
        "An exuberant, well- crafted film that gets the audience involved on a gut level.\n",
        "The results are mainly awful, and even Roth got saddled with a mannered part that he can't comfortably play.\n",
        "Four of the hottest indie directors--Anders, Rockwell, Tarantino, and Rodrigues--miss a unique opportunity to display their idiosyncratic talents resulting in a tedious anthology in which 2 segments are inept, one barely decent, and one OK (guess whose)\n",
        "They should have called this One Room and released it as a Rodriguez short.\n",
        "The less said about this career-denting fiasco, the better.\n",
        "Sounds better than it is.\n",
        "Four Rooms has been cut substantially since a disastrous September reception at the Toronto Film Festival, though it's hard to imagine it running any longer.\n",
        "The four segments are widely different in quality. On the useful scale of the Michelin guides, one is worth a trip, another is worth a detour, and the other two are a colossal waste of bandwidth.\n",
        "Four Rooms asserts itself as a goof so laboriously and aggressively that you almost feel pinned back in your seat.\n",
        "The result is a batch of shrill, self-indulgent sketches that turn so wretched in spots you start to wonder if the filmmakers wanted them to be bad.\n",
        "The segments are uniformly weak.\n",
        "Four Rooms has to be one of 1995's major disappointments.\n",
        "There's so little to watch besides Carrey, in fact, it makes you actually miss (gasp!) Sean Young from Ace 1.\n",
        "Bounces along with a lame script and inconsistent pace.\n",
        "Hardly worth the four-year wait.\n",
        "More viscerally charged than \"Speed\" and hipper than \"Die Hard With a Vengeance,\" the movie is a careening, screeching joyride that showers sparks like fireworks.\n",
        "\"Money Train\" is a by-the-numbers action-buddy picture, and few directors run through those numbers as smoothly as Joseph Ruben.\n",
        "Even if they only charged a token, it would be too much.\n",
        "It's stupid, but also breezier than the year's other 12-score releases not worth a second look.\n",
        "A big, noisy headache of a movie...\n",
        "Hollywood has been in love with mobsters since the beginning of movies. But the other side of the equation has seldom been considered. That is, until now.\n",
        "A drolly offbeat look at Hollywood mores dedicated to the proposition that the best preparation for becoming a film producer is a stint in the criminal underworld.\n",
        "An entertaining comedy-thriller adapted by Scott Frank from the Elmore Leonard best-seller and directed with bounce (if not much nuance) by Barry Sonnenfeld.\n",
        "Everything clicks.\n",
        "It's part of the joke here that Chili is a die-hard cineaste and loves reminiscing about smart, stylish tough-guy films he has enjoyed. Get Shorty belongs on that list.\n",
        "It's Travolta -- smooth, commanding, handsome as ever, a cool, rhythmic bop in his walk -- who owns the film.\n",
        "The result is one of the best movies of the year and by far the most entertaining.\n",
        "In the category of amiable diversions it's awfully tough to improve on.\n",
        "Irresistibly charming.\n",
        "Minor, but amusingly droll.\n",
        "One of the pleasures of Get Shorty is watching the way the plot moves effortlessly from crime to the movies - not a long distance, since both industries are based on fear, greed, creativity and intimidation.\n",
        "This comic potboiler about gangsters in Hollywood would be a great piece of fun even without Travolta. But as a loan shark from Miami with a charming bedside manner and bigtime movie dreams, he raises the fun quotient into the sublime.\n",
        "While it's quite possible for the cinematically unaware to enjoy this film, this is a real treat for movie buffs. The story is as much about the love of motion pictures as it is about gangsters.\n",
        "Copycat, despite two tough-babe leads to kill for, flies in more directions than scattered kitty litter.\n",
        "A garish and poorly filmed chop-socky frolic that makes about as much sense as an Escher painting viewed through Vaseline-smudged Ray-Bans.\n",
        "Perhaps such phenomenal slaughter is best left to the imagination.\n",
        "The problem is that the fight sequences -- the only reason anyone sees a movie like this in the first place -- are muddy, chaotic and boring. Even diehard fans of this genre would be well advised to skip this one.\n",
        "This saga, set in Berlin, is more committed to its bloodletting than to any of its characters.\n",
        "A movie that provides plenty of jolts but precious little pleasure.\n",
        "This movie knows exactly what it is: Gonzo silliness about bodies turned into human salsa.\n",
        "Shouldn't throwing stars be silent? If they're gonna sound like gunshots, why not just use guns?\n",
        "It's a gorefest, a borefest and a snorefest.\n",
        "Thanks to the movie's dire script, flat performances and excessively slick, tricked-out fight scenes, it gets increasingly hard to care about anything that goes on here, even when it happens to be visible without the use of night-vision goggles.\n",
        "This one is simply a diverting, uncommonly violent action flick. No need for an extended critical postmortem. Except to say the Wachowski brothers' trademark seems to have turned into a designer brand dedicated to producing inexpensive knockoffs.\n",
        "Rain is a very talented slaughterer. He could kill you with a pair of tweezers, a hair dryer, two bananas, whatever. Be glad he's a good ninja.\n",
        "When a movie's first scene shows one thug getting the top of his head sliced off and another being chopped diagonally in half, you know you're not in for much of a dramatic crescendo.\n",
        "What's a recovering ninja assassin to do? Why, paint the screen bright red, of course. Splatter it on. We're talking streaks and rivers of blood -- bloody swords, bloody clothes and, my personal favorite, bloody stumps.\n",
        "Ninja Assassin lives in the moment, a visceral gouge of a picture, and sections of it move so fast -- and are so intriguingly, dimly lit -- that you have to use your imagination a bit to discern what's happening.\n",
        "Heads may roll, torsos get severed and geysers of blood spurt, but no amount of CGI'd gore can save 'Assassin' from being dramatically lame, visually impaired and kinetically flat-footed.\n",
        "The credits for Ninja Assassin list two screenwriters and one director. But it's fair to say the movie has come straight out of a box.\n",
        "This amateurish action flick is so lacking in personality or punch, it ought to be titled \"V for Video Store Discount Bin.\"\n",
        "Let's be honest, killing is this film's business... and business is good.\n",
        "McTeigue can barely shoot straight, and the editing is so hack-y, you have to take the stunts and fight choreography on faith.\n",
        "Performed to the hilt by Flanery and filmed with conviction by Victor Salva, the movie is finally too solemn to survive its pushy musical strings.\n",
        "Dark and giddy at the same time, Leaving Las Vegas takes us into dreamy, intoxicated places no movie about an alcoholic has gone before.\n",
        "We're not talking high, morally instructive tragedy here, just a hard lesson in postmodernist outlawry and its sad little anarchies.\n",
        "The film pulls no punches, takes no prisoners and flies in the face of feel-good pictures.\n",
        "The plot goes nowhere, but under the pornographic circumstances Figgis, Cage, and Shue all do fine jobs.\n",
        "It certainly has the courage of its convictions.\n",
        "Small, searing film.\n",
        "A uniquely hypnotic and haunting love story sparked by Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue at their career best.\n",
        "A film laden with virtues but difficult to embrace.\n",
        "Nicolas Cage, who has a track record of immersing himself in parts, gives one of the year's most powerful acting turns.\n",
        "Tough to watch, but haunting enough to deserve its initial praise.\n",
        "Cage, a resourceful and daring actor, has never been better.\n",
        "A highly engaging attempt at Shakespeare's most domestic tragedy.\n",
        "Mr. Branagh's superb performance...guarantees this film an immediacy that any audience will understand.\n",
        "Davies has done an admirable job of condensing the sprawling action.\n",
        "Parker has shown how involving and moving Shakespeare can still be on the screen.\n",
        "Parker, whose screenplay strips down the original play, merely produces a lackluster essence.\n",
        "For sheer impact, this Othello can stand side-by-side with the versions brought to the screen by Orson Welles (as restored in 1992) and Lawrence Olivier.\n",
        "The movie is roughly on the same cinematic level as the Mel Gibson Hamlet, though it tends to get under your skin a little more once it gets rolling.\n",
        "... Will not give its viewers much of an idea of the Shakespeare play, and may inadvertently give them other ideas, about interracial love, that were not much on Shakespeare's mind.\n",
        "Passion, like outpourings of iambic pentameter, isn't part of this picture's equation.\n",
        "The real question is, could director Oliver Parker have done worse?\n",
        "Now and Then is successful, but only now and then.\n",
        "The film offers the same pleasures as an Austen novel, as the audience sinks into a comforting, orderly world where life-shattering disruptions are handled with elegant ease.\n",
        "Austen fans: Prepare to be swept away.\n",
        "Persuasion is Jane without pain, E-Z Austen. It's a delight.\n",
        "Michell's approach to Persuasion indicates that he is the rarest of literary translators -- one who is genuinely interested in a work's themes, its characters and what the author has to say about the world in which they exist.\n",
        "Much of the movie's emotional work has to be done by...faces and eyes, while other people speak of other things, and to see that happening is frustrating, because it happens so slowly, and romantic, because it happens at all.\n",
        "There's a wonderful, unhurried delicacy about Persuasion, Roger Mitchell's adaptation of Jane Austen's final novel.\n",
        "Vanessa Redgrave has never been more likable on screen than in her buoyantly athletic turn here.\n",
        "Jeunet and Caro have distinctive signatures like nobody else's.\n",
        "On visual terms alone, The City of Lost Children is something of a masterpiece, using state-of-the-art physical, optical and digital special effects to stretch cinematic boundaries.\n",
        "Essentially, The City of Lost Children is a macabre fairy tale, and while its tentacled comic-book plot and freak-show cast narrow its appeal -- this isn't a work of any allegorical depth -- Caro and Jeunet have pulled off a cinematic delight.\n",
        "The City of Lost Children gets so caught up in its own weirdness that it all but shuts out the viewer.\n",
        "An empty triumph of overkill set design and weirdo casting.\n",
        "Set in a wondrously seedy waterfront world populated with runaway children and grotesque, sinister adults, it glistens with dense fantasies, technological feats that make the catch-phrase \"state of the art\" seem antique.\n",
        "The emotions seem almost as manufactured as the sets.\n",
        "With each frame filled to bursting point with visual detail and multiplaned design, plus razor-sharp cutting that often eliminates transitions, it's not a movie you can afford to take your eyes off for a second.\n",
        "Extraordinary.\n",
        "Watching the film is like leafing through a giant sketchbook crammed with intriguing ideas that can't all be comfortably fitted into the same master plan.\n",
        "The City of Lost Children is a stunningly surreal fantasy, a fable of longing and danger, of heroic deeds and bravery, set in a brilliantly realized world of its own. It is one of the most audacious, original films of the year.\n",
        "The City of Lost Children is as visually striking and daringly offbeat as its predecessor.\n",
        "Children hasn't enough of a human dimension to be 'fun' itself, but it's still warped enough to amuse anyone with a tilted frame of mind.\n",
        "The City of Lost Children is a series of associated visual stimuli so imaginative and omnivorous that their spectacle has the effect of wearing us out. Nevertheless, if you think of yourself as warped, you really must see this.\n",
        "The French fantasy adventure The City of Lost Children is a dark phantasmagoria so visually amazing and provocative -- yet dense and confusing -- that viewers may need to see it more than once to take it all in.\n",
        "Many people will probably not find themselves sympathetic to this movie's overachieving technological pretensions, while others will find it the best film in months or years.\n",
        "Shanghai Triad concludes the sublime seven-movie collaboration of Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou and actress Gong Li with a bang worthy of the most jubilant New Year's Eve.\n",
        "Pfeiffer gives a funny, scrappy performance that makes you feel a committed teacher's fire to make a difference.\n",
        "The tale screenwriter Ronald Bass came up with, and the way director John N. Smith tells it, is stereotypical, predictable and simplified to the point of meaninglessness.\n",
        "If only the filmmakers had used some subtlety in telling the story, they could have done right by the real LouAnne Johnson.\n",
        "What makes it work is the integrity of Pfeiffer's performance and Smith's direction, and the high spirits of the young, racially diverse supporting cast.\n",
        "The movie pretends to show poor black kids being bribed into literacy by Dylan and candy bars, but actually it is the crossover white audience that is being bribed with mind-candy in the form of safe words by the two Dylans.\n",
        "The movie has real emotional and reportorial credibility, a prime source of its power.\n",
        "Pfeiffer has a lot of good moments as Johnson.\n",
        "Stay home and watch Welcome Back Kotter. It's more enlightening.\n",
        "Pfieffer is absurdly miscast: Sly Stallone would make a more plausible Mr. Chips than the frail, squeaky actress does a nine-year veteran of the Marine Corps.\n",
        "This 40-minute epic about mountain survival in the wake of a plane crash is like sitting through Alive again, though in this case there isn't anything for the hero to eat.\n",
        "Babe is not, strictly speaking, a kid's movie. It is a preposterously funny fable that strikes a chord with adults, too.\n",
        "For children, the movie will play like a storybook come to life. Adults, at first, will marvel at the special effects and puppetry. But ultimately, they'll be won over by the nuances of a story that finds a fresh way to deliver a timeless message.\n",
        "A film that is exceptional in its technical effects and its graceful ability to entertain.\n",
        "[It's] a comedy of animal manners that is much funnier and much cannier than any recent movie about human relationships: a lovely, stubbornly idiosyncratic fable of aspiration and survival.\n",
        "It has a surprising charm.\n",
        "Australian director Chris Noonan and producer George Miller show what real talent and imagination can do, even without big-name humans as costars.\n",
        "The characters (both animal and human) are solidly conceived, and the storytelling and visuals are expertly fashioned.\n",
        "A dazzling family entertainment with enormous charm that utilizes breathtaking technical innovation.\n",
        "Charming, eccentric and very amusing.\n",
        "A lovely, intelligent gem of G-rated entertainment that is also rib-tickling funny.\n",
        "If only people would be more like these animals, the world, though hardly saner, would certainly be a lot more fun.\n",
        "The underlying tricks are never allowed to upstage the story in all its humble sweetness.\n",
        "A silk purse among children's entertainment.\n",
        "The movie, directed by Chris Noonan, who wrote the screenplay with George Miller, takes a child's-eye view of a world that is photographed to look like a storybook come to life.\n",
        "A hilarious fantasy, about a plucky piglet that learns how to tend sheep, Babe is a barnyard charmer.\n",
        "Babe is a movie made with charm and wit, and unlike some family movies it does not condescend, not for a second.\n",
        "Through a mixture of imaginative storytelling, impressive animatronics, and irresistible cuteness, Babe casts a spell over all viewers -- young, old, or somewhere in between.\n",
        "The leads do physically resemble their real-life prototypes, judging from last year's coffee-table book on Carrington's art and personal circle. But the snail's pacing, vague writing and Thompson herself leave a fatal void.\n",
        "Tim Robbins's balanced yet uncompromising approach refuses to judge any of the characters, including the killer (superlatively played by Sean Penn), instead giving each a fair chance to present their case with dignity and respect.\n",
        "An intelligent, balanced, devastating movie.\n",
        "Takes us along on the reluctant, difficult, essentially spiritual journey these two unlikely people make together.\n",
        "Dead Man Walking could easily be manipulative or exploitative, but it's neither. Instead, this is hard-hitting drama that neither accepts nor offers quarter.\n",
        "A thought-provoking drama not to be missed or dismissed.\n",
        "An extremely affecting experience\n",
        "Robbins, who also wrote the script, is no Truman Capote, let alone a Victor Hugo, and his film trips up constantly on indecisiveness about what it is he's trying to say.\n",
        "It will send you home with more than a few long thoughts.\n",
        "is the finest, least compromised film about capital punishment ever advancing a gently stated 'anti' view but going the extra 100 miles to give victims their due.\n",
        "Absorbing, surprising, technically superb and worth talking about for a long time afterward\n",
        "Robbins and Susan Sarandon, have crafted a film that transcends its own political message by a scrupulous attention to detail.\n",
        "Don't go unadvised, and don't plan anything too frivolous for right afterwards. But do go.\n",
        "A daring stand and a daring, uncompromised film.\n",
        "Acting rarely gets better than this.\n",
        "Penn gives an astonishing performance and delivers exactly what Dead Man Walking needs.\n",
        "The picture is cloudy in intent.\n",
        "Sarandon, who won the Oscar for Best Actress for this role, is superb, but Penn is extraordinary.\n",
        "Its final moments leave us awash in emotion.\n",
        "Employing 3-D and PSE sound, then projected on a screen that suggests a small skyscraper, the new show at West Side Manhattan's Sony IMAX theater is, visually speaking, nothing but a clear day... but it definitely put me in scat-mode.\n",
        "The film's underlying sentiment is conveyed effectively, if obviously.\n",
        "Alas, the Olsen girls are not immediately heart-warming.\n",
        "Under the direction of Andy Tennant, the Olsen sisters lay on the icky-poo cuteness with several trowels, often delivering their lines as though they were reciting the alphabet.\n",
        "A harmless caper that ought to thrill girls under 12, and offer modest diversion to their parents.\n",
        "Writer Deborah Dean Davis and director Andy Tennant are fully aware of the absolute predictability of their material and therefore make the getting to an inevitable ending as much fun as possible.\n",
        "A rote variation on Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper that is marginally salvaged by those spunky Olsen twins from ABC's Full House.\n",
        "It's so featherbrained and lightweight, it almost elevates its inconsequence into a style.\n",
        "With their perilously wide, Walter Keane eyes, the Olsen twins are cute enough, but compared with other child performers their charms seem forced.\n",
        "Engaging if uneven.\n",
        "Since the robust 17th-century picaresque tale is not enjoying any current vogue, the success of \"Restoration\" can be considered a very pleasant surprise.\n",
        "The film is overcome by the rumbling workings of a creaky plot as the story grows more serious.\n",
        "The movie takes on a somber, fitful atmosphere of straining epic proportions. But it strays into an episodic bog that leaves it gasping for dramatic life.\n",
        "Lively, lavish and grandly acted pageant.\n",
        "What virtues the movie has are cosmetic.\n",
        "While this sly and sumptuous new film offers just the single word as its title, it will make you think of all you learned about Restoration comedy -- and drama -- in that long-ago History of the Theater 101 course.\n",
        "Solid entertainment, especially in a season when Hollywood's releases are repeatedly causing grimaces.\n",
        "A garishly gilded, gloriously overstuffed costume drama.\n",
        "Restoration avoids the pitfalls of pious historical reconstructions and plunges right into the cauldron.\n",
        "Where others have sunk in the mire of imitation, director Paul Anderson and writer Kevin Droney effect a viable balance between exquisitely choreographed action and ironic visual and verbal counterpoint.\n",
        "British director Anderson does a fair job with what he was given: four good-looking leads, some very impressive sfx, Babylonian sets, a bone-crunching soundtrack, and a battery of well-choreographed fights.\n",
        "The most intriguing is a glassy-eyed follower whose right hand shoots out a hissing reptile that can extend itself for miles. Exotic creatures like these make watching Mortal Kombat feel like being in a high-tech fun house.\n",
        "Likely to satisfy only the core audience already hooked on video and arcade games, and even that's not a sure thing.\n",
        "The movie has everything a teenage boy could want... Everything, that is, but an interesting plot, decent dialogue and compelling acting.\n",
        "The movie that most nearly approximates a video game: lots of action, no plot, eye-catching computer effects and a dollop of violence.\n",
        "Just looks and plays a lot like Johnny Mnemonic, Double Dragon and other video-game-inspired, mayhem-filled messes.\n",
        "Len Wiseman handles many of the set-pieces with flair and tension.\n",
        "It's not remotely plausible, but with Willis' McClane leaping onto the tailfins of passing jet fighters and bringing down helicopters by launching police cars at them, there's enough stuff blowing up that action fans won't mind much.\n",
        "The bad guys' omnipotence at nearly every turn dilutes the film's suspense.\n",
        "An enjoyable pop projection of post-9/11 anxiety. That said, it also makes you nostalgic for the days when irresponsible action movies didn't have to deal with it.\n",
        "What's the fourth \"Die Hard\" called? I keep forgetting. \"Die Hard: With a Pension\"? \"Die Hardened Arteries\"? \"Die Laughing\"?\n",
        "Movie characters like McClane are the Paul Bunyans and John Henrys and Pecos Bills of our age, the stuff of tall tales spun with the technology of an age whose campfires are found in multiplexes with stadium seating.\n",
        "The rookie mistakes are legion.\n",
        "Willis should not be the victim of facile stereotyping. He brings more heart and humor to apocalyptic pulp fiction than any other actor I can think of offhand.\n",
        "Far from the crass, just-for-the-money sequel it appeared to be on paper. It's a genuine blast.\n",
        "Terrific entertainment, and startlingly shrewd in the bargain, a combination of minimalist performances -- interestingly minimalist -- and maximalist stunts that make you laugh, as you gape, at their thunderous extravagance.\n",
        "Easily the best in the series since the first one.\n",
        "The real intrigue has to do with whether McClane -- 'a Timex watch in a digital age,' per the lead baddie (Timothy Olyphant) -- can log in to 2007.\n",
        "Willis' John McClane, with that sly, sideways smile, is like an old acquaintance you don't mind running into. He may be older and balder, but he's none the worse for the wear. And he can still take a punch.\n",
        "Live Free or Die Hard may work better for an audience that doesn't know much about the series than it will for Die Hard die hards, who will be wondering who that impersonator is and what he did with the real John McClane.\n",
        "This paradox comes with an attendant fallacy: that the best way to solve the static problem is to make the stunts even larger, the bangs even bigger. Wrong: More action just stops the film longer.\n",
        "It is a movie born to be forgotten-except as something that against your better judgment, you had a pretty good time watching back in the summer of '07.\n",
        "Live Free or Die Hard is indeed a worthy successor to the original -- not perhaps quite as good, but close.\n",
        "The post-9/11 techno-terrorist stuff works, the fights are creative and funny, and Willis is in top form in his career-defining role.\n",
        "Sorry, boys. After two decades, the first film still does more with one skyscraper than Live Free or Die Hard does with an entire country.\n",
        "That this implausible stew works as well as it does is in part a tribute to the unlikely but enjoyable rapport that forms between old school McClane and his youthful computer-savvy companion.\n",
        "Despite its hard-sell coming attraction and pot-smoking granny singing rock oldies, How to Make an American Quilt turns out to be a wealth of old-style Hollywood magic.\n",
        "The greatest movie ever made about warriors and battle.\n",
        "Again and again, Kurosawa sends a dark thrill through his audience with a touch of sensuous physical reality.\n",
        "Kurosawa's film is a model of long-form construction, ably fitting its asides and anecdotes into a powerful suspense structure that endures for all of the film's 208 minutes.\n",
        "Besides the well-manned battlescenes, the pic has a good feeling for characterization and time.\n",
        "The epic action scenes involving cavalry and samurai are still without peer.\n",
        "Seven Samurai is an unforgettable masterpiece -- the work of one of the world's greatest filmmakers at the height of his powers.\n",
        "[Kurosawa] has loaded his film with unusual and exciting physical incidents and made the whole thing graphic in a hard, realistic western style.\n",
        "The archetypal action classic.\n",
        "The greatest action movie ever made.\n",
        "Moves like hot mercury, and it draws a viewer so thoroughly into its world that real life can seem thick and dull when the lights come up.\n",
        "Rich in detail, vivid in characterization, leisurely in exposition, this 207-minute epic is bravura filmmaking.\n",
        "Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai (1954) is not only a great film in its own right, but the source of a genre that would flow through the rest of the century.\n",
        "Just about everything in this lavish, animated feature is for the pigtail set.\n",
        "[A] handsome, deeply felt, even more deeply reverent animated musical.\n",
        "Overall this seems like a reasonable stab at an impossible agenda.\n",
        "All Disney has really done in its disappointing 33rd animated feature is revive the stereotype of the Noble Savage.\n",
        "The Disney artists have created a vivid palette for the picture.\n",
        "Why make a Disney cartoon and take all the fun out of it?\n",
        "Pocahontas can't get stirred dramatically for political correctness, the finale will please nobody, and the songs are duff. That said, there are enough incidental felicities to pass the time pleasantly.\n",
        "Any damage such revisionist history may impose on young minds is offset by the honestly inspiring thoughts Pocahontas offers.\n",
        "Disney's 33rd animated feature, and its first with characters based on real people, is a stunning movie with clever twists, vivid characterizations, insightful songs and a surprising harvest of revisionist history.\n",
        "Disney deserves praise for raising the ante on its ambitions in animation. Next time, though, a little less civics lesson and a little more heart.\n",
        "Adult viewers, spoiled by what has come before, may feel that this film, which relates the legendary romance between a chief's daughter and English adventurer John Smith in the New World, is more by-the-numbers than inspired.\n",
        "As for the songs, they're guaranteed to keep your shoes glued to the floor\n",
        "Imagine a cult Disney cartoon, for this may be it.\n",
        "Taking advantage of the studio's breathtakingly intricate animation, directors Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg have breathed vitality into this, the fifth 'new wave' Disney animated picture.\n",
        "Pocahontas is the best-looking of the modern Disney animated features, and one of the more thoughtful: It is about real issues, even if it treats them with naive idealism.\n",
        "It is so focused on its own boldness, its dare-to-shock sensuality (the film got an NC-17 from the MPAA, but is being released unrated), that nothing else comes through.\n",
        "When Night is Falling has too many unintended laughs for its passion to be convincing.\n",
        "Rozema is a fabulist with a strong visual sense, and she creates a distinctive, enclosed world to illustrate Camille's odyssey.\n",
        "Symbols are supposed to be subtle, but Rozema is intent upon bludgeoning the audience with them.\n",
        "An imaginative, entertaining crime mystery with plenty of nerve and vigor.\n",
        "If the pleasures of The Usual Suspects are the more superficial ones of ingenuity and style, those are abundantly available. The twists and turns of the plot are an awful lot of fun, while the ending is genuinely satisfying and surprising.\n",
        "In a season of fat blockbusters, a picture as brainy, bitter, and compact as this one comes as a shock and a treat.\n",
        "It's a nerve-shredding suspense movie about corruption, a bravura actor's show full of deliciously twisted cops and robbers, and a complex riddle packed with unexpected turns.\n",
        "For many true movie fiends, noir is the key American movie type, and the most fun when it's done right. The Usual Suspects is done right.\n",
        "I didn't believe this story for a minute, even in movie terms -- though it's less offensive than a piece of junk like Apt Pupil, Singer's subsequent feature.\n",
        "A terrific cast of exciting actors socks over this absorbingly complicated yarn that's been spun in seductively slick fashion by director Bryan Singer.\n",
        "Singer creates a classy, thought-provoking mystery that is pleasingly old-fashioned and absolutely modern in the sly, slightly self-conscious play it makes with myth and methods of storytelling.\n",
        "This movie finally isn't anything more than an intricate feat of gamesmanship, but it's still quite something to see.\n",
        "The Usual Suspects is the freshest, funniest and scariest crime thriller to come along since Pulp Fiction.\n",
        "But like a tale from the Arabian Nights, told for the sheer pleasure of storytelling, this elegant puzzle not only enjoys showing off, it also has something to show.\n",
        "The Usual Suspects is an accomplished synthesis of noir elements and, as such, is an entertaining entry to the genre.\n",
        "Next to the steady diet of Hollywood formula, contrived plots and situations a regular moviegoer can spot a mile off, The Usual Suspects is something quite different: A movie that's smarter than you are.\n",
        "After following the beckoning twists and turns, you're left trapped and more than a little disappointed for getting in so deep.\n",
        "After I first saw the film, I recommended it to people as an entertaining and commercial crime thriller; a standard story done very well. And then I saw it again. The movie is so much better the second time.\n",
        "The twist at the end is a corker, but crucial questions remain unanswered. What's interesting, though, is how little this intrudes on our enjoyment.\n",
        "Director Bryan Singer gives his film enough surface flash to entertain future late-night cable possibilities.\n",
        "As entertainment, the film is a lukewarm experience. But as a piece of construction, The Usual Suspects is a slick bit of business.\n",
        "Lots of fun and a very handsome, widescreen production by director Bryan Singer, who co-wrote the original script with once-and-future partner (and ex-private detective) Christopher McQuarrie.\n",
        "Once again, my comprehension began to slip, and finally I wrote down: 'To the degree that I do understand, I don't care.'\n",
        "Were Mira Sorvino's all-redeeming, possibly best- list-bound performance to melt away, it would immediately be obvious how malnourished this amiably minor effort is.\n",
        "The confused script trades in such heavy topics as alcoholism and child sexual abuse, but every dramatic scene plays like one of those schmaltzy Happy Days moments that inevitably drew a big 'Awwwwww!' from the studio audience.\n",
        "The film is unforgivable.\n",
        "Time for a new book by Jane Fonda, and this time I expect a full chapter on how she got snookered into doing Georgia Rule.\n",
        "The central problem with the movie isn't that it deals with several hot-button topics, but that it addresses them with a shocking lack of emotional honesty.\n",
        "Georgia Rule doesn't make you feel good; it makes you queasy.\n",
        "You'd think that decree No. 1 for a movie about rules would be to know exactly what kind of picture you're making and selling. Georgia Rule fails that basic test, and a whole lot of other ones besides.\n",
        "As an acting showcase -- the supporting roles are as rich as the leads -- Georgia Rule is undeniably one of the year's best American dramedies.\n",
        "It's a creepy, tone-deaf movie about three generations of women.\n",
        "A murky blend of melodrama and comedy.\n",
        "Do not take your mom to Georgia Rule unless she's Roseanne Barr. You may expect a three-generational chick flick, but what you get is a child-rape comedy.\n",
        "Misguided at best and repellent at worst.\n",
        "You can see what they are striving for, but Georgia Rule is so artificial, it feels like more of a flow chart than a slice of life.\n",
        "Not to excuse her apparent lack of professionalism, but can you blame Lohan for showing up to work in bad shape?\n",
        "If there is a 'What Were They Thinking?' Hall of Shame, there's a whole wall preserved for Georgia Rule, a feel-good, mothers-and-daughters comedy about child sexual abuse.\n",
        "There's little gussied up in this surprisingly tart mother-child-grandchild reunion picture, written by Mark Andrus.\n",
        "It's a shame Lohan's best work to date is bogged down in a film that wants to be in the same league as Terms of Endearment but is only marginally better than Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.\n",
        "Georgia Rule is a bad idea dreadfully executed -- On Golden Pond with fellatio jokes and whimsical incest melodrama and Fonda playing her dad (who, more and more, she eerily resembles).\n",
        "Certain words should be reserved for special occasions. 'Abysmal' is one of them, and Georgia Rule is as special as such occasions get.\n",
        "Foster's second directorial effort is a vividly drawn if too episodic portrait of an eccentric family, well acted by the entire cast, especially Holly Hunter and Robery Downey Jr.\n",
        "A modest film (in every sense) which pushes the gags too hard.\n",
        "Spirited but uneven.\n",
        "Neither caustic nor sentimental, it's a film that maybe half the people on Earth have at one time considered writing.\n",
        "Foster keeps the party hopping, although more dark humor would have helped before she winds it down with sentiment and bromides.\n",
        "Foster and Richter, of course, want to do more than make audiences laugh; they want us to be touched by their characters' humanity and take an interest in a budding romance, but that rarely is the case.\n",
        "With many of the conversations going on simultaneously, it's difficult -- sometimes even impossible -- to know who is saying what and to whom.\n",
        "With her keen actor's instincts, Foster piles on plenty for her terrific cast to chew on and for us to savor.\n",
        "The movie, which is about the Thanksgiving family reunion from hell, is not exactly a comedy and yet not a drama, either. Like many family reunions, it has a little of both elements, and the strong sense that madness is being held just out of sight.\n",
        "Aside from a few effective, low-key scenes, the movie doesn't involve the viewer.\n",
        "The Postman (Il Postino) is slight, but it's tough to imagine anyone not liking it.\n",
        "This idealized tribute to a charismatic teacher who devotes himself to music appreciation has the same old-fashioned texture and sticky sentimentality as Goodbye Mr. Chips (of 1939), but Dreyfuss gives an effective, surprisingly restrained performance\n",
        "An overwrought Disney weeper.\n",
        "Full of very obvious spoofery, and funnier in concept than in execution.\n",
        "A free-for-all comic spoof that brings the 'hood' genre of Hollywood films full circle.\n",
        "Rude, crude and outrageous.\n",
        "Outrageous is the key word here. In many successful scenes, the Wayans deftly play on our assumptions and cliches.\n",
        "Things might be bad, the movie suggests, but they're not so bad you can't laugh.\n",
        "[An] aimless romantic-comedy caper.\n",
        "Despite the advances humankind has made since dragging itself out of the primordial ooze, Shore is a successful comedian.\n",
        "Even with the low expectations any reasonable viewer brings to a Shore flick, this rates only stupid-plus.\n",
        "It's not by any means inspired madness.\n",
        "Inept in almost every respect.\n",
        "America faces the very real prospect that Pauly Shore is the most annoying comic alive.\n",
        "A spoof of eco-consciousness starring one-man toxic spill Pauly Shore.\n",
        "No one is going to see Lawnmower Man 2 for the acting, however; the film rises or falls on its special effects...\n",
        "Mowing the lawn might be more involving than watching this subpar sci-fi sequel, which manages to be complicated and witless at the same time.\n",
        "If King of the Hill couldn't draw patrons despite appearing on tons of 10-best lists, what's a comparably themed small-change remembrance gonna do?\n",
        "Imagine two movies plucked from opposite sides of the video store.\n",
        "A deliriously trashy, exuberantly vulgar, lavishly appointed exploitation picture, this weird combo of road-kill movie and martial-arts vampire gorefest is made to order for the stimulation of teenage boys.\n",
        "On a mindless exploitation level this is pretty good, but on other levels it seems to make promises that it fails to deliver on.\n",
        "A tired, humorless pastiche of various exploitation genres that is not the least bit imaginative in its campy deconstruction of conventions.\n",
        "Rodriguez has a lot of fun dreaming up cool ways to kill people (he's making this his life's work), but he also gets something resembling a performance from Tarantino and transforms Clooney into a full-fledged movie star.\n",
        "Mr. Rodriguez demonstrates his talents more clearly than ever -- he's visually inventive, quick-witted and a fabulous editor -- while still hampering himself with sophomoric material.\n",
        "The picture shows what happens when a writer (Tarantino) and a director (Rodriguez) come together and reinforce each other's worst tendencies and misconceptions.\n",
        "As the bloodsuckers attack our 'heroes' again and again, you feel like you're watching a video game -- from dusk to dawn.\n",
        "It's great fun, but certainly not great art.\n",
        "The movie, which treats you with contempt for even watching it, is a monument to its own lack of imagination.\n",
        "An enjoyable movie.\n",
        "One could scavenge the thesaurus to find synonyms for 'awkward' to describe Crawford's performance.\n",
        "Crawford packs a phallic pistol and traipses through the rain in a transparent slip. Share the fantasy, babe.\n",
        "The lamest model-turned-actress movie since Lauren Hutton co-starred with Evel Knievel in the misbegotten Viva Knievel!\n",
        "Howlingly bad -- so awful, in fact, that it can actually be enjoyed on a certain level.\n",
        "The movie is fast, slick and dumb as a post.\n",
        "Works as a thriller for anyone who lives entirely in the present. Those with longer memories will find the film grows increasingly funny as it rolls along.\n",
        "Will Ferrell has become the most unlikely embodiment of wholesome family fun since Fred MacMurray gave up film noir for My Three Sons.\n",
        "... barely watchable.\n",
        "A zero, but the title describes how the audience is likely to react, perfectly.\n",
        "Ferrell is one of the film's few bright lights. It's a shame to hide that subversive beacon under a bushel of dully inspirational sports movie cliches.\n",
        "As lazy, bloated and TV-screen- friendly as shameless promos come.\n",
        "If you're into Will Ferrell.\n",
        "It just plods along, harmless but lifeless, going exactly where you think it's going.\n",
        "Sit in a room by yourself, look at a blank screen for 90 minutes, and you'll have more of a chance of laughing at your own thoughts than you will at this movie.\n",
        "Stop me if you've heard this before.\n",
        "Silly, mindless and derivative, but Duvall brings some bite to the proceedings and Ferrell is dependably amusing.\n",
        "Both Duvall and Mike Ditka, who plays himself and helps coach Phil's team, spend too much of the movie on the bench, and while they're there, the jokes run thin.\n",
        "Even a soccer-savvy audience has better things to do -- like instilling unsportsmanlike behavior in their kids or sabotaging rival teams.\n",
        "Most of the time, [the kids] go along. Most of the time we do, too.\n",
        "A limping string of laboured sight gags and sentimental cliches.\n",
        "Doesn't quite deliver the comedy goods, but it plays well in spurts and, thanks to Ferrell, remains slightly off-kilter.\n",
        "The sort of almost-there family movie for which half-stars exist in ratings.\n",
        "Rather shakily directed by Jesse (son of Bob) Dylan, who possibly knows something about larger-than-life fathers.\n",
        "The kind of movie that makes you wonder why anyone would even bother making it in the first place.\n",
        "A good script is the most essential ingredient for a good movie. Hiring a comedian isn't enough.\n",
        "Without a doubt the most emotionally powerful and handsomely mounted production of the story yet.\n",
        "The movie's whole virtuous conception of Jean Valjean sticks in my craw. He's haunted and hunted, but he reeks of a reasoned, noble superiority that's a pretty sterile quality in the hero of an epic.\n",
        "With a first-rate cast and a venerable storytelling style, it fluently condenses Victor Hugo's epic novel and retrieves some of its suspenseful momentum.\n",
        "Towering over the entire film is Liam Neeson, the Irish actor who seems at home in any kind of picture, whether it transpires in contemporary America, World War II Germany, or centuries-ago Scotland.\n",
        "It never sinks, but it never really soars either, though here and there it hits a powerful moment.\n",
        "It contains the moments of high drama, clearly outlines all the motivations, is easy to follow and lacks only passion. A story filled with outrage and idealism becomes somehow merely picturesque.\n",
        "Don't blame the leads, but the movie has less emotional resonance than an old FTD florist commercial with Merlin Olsen.\n",
        "A moronic buddy comedy with a fuzzy-wuzzy coating.\n",
        "Based on a short story by the great nutball sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, Screamers is more like a high-pitched rip-off of Alien.\n",
        "A fun, fast-paced futuristic thriller with enough jolts per frame to keep even the most impatient action fan happy.\n",
        "The design and effects teams have lent scale and impact to the futuristic locations and sets. If only Duguay's flashy, aimless direction had succeeded in filling these barren wastes and antiseptic interiors with something resembling human life.\n",
        "Until it succumbs to one cliche too many, Screamers, which was directed by Christian Duguay, does an efficient job of generating a stomach-knotting tension.\n",
        "There's nothing exhilarating or enjoyable in any of this.\n",
        "Screamers oozes atmosphere. It's a dark film that borrows heavily from the likes of the Alien films, Dune, Blade Runner, and John Carpenter's updated The Thing.\n",
        "A pile of recycled space junk, it alienates even while flinging body parts into the audience's yawning faces.\n",
        "It's not exactly a bad movie; it's made with a certain imagination and intelligence. But its future is so grungy and grim it makes our current mess look like Utopia.\n",
        "In its last minutes Screamers becomes the last thing it intends to be -- laughable.\n",
        "As recorded in the great wealth of documentary footage Ofteringer has assembled, the cheekbones slowly collapse and the blue eyes become watery, their owner becoming more and more dependent on hard drugs and fast living.\n",
        "With extraordinary technique, Ofteringer paints a moody, melancholy picture of a legend who decayed into the ghost of herself.\n",
        "That voyeuristic fascination with doomed glamour is one of the guilty pleasures of Susanne Ofteringer's utterly haunting documentary film, Nico Icon.\n",
        "Nico-Icon is more than the investigation of a doomed celebrity: It's also a mirror reflecting her friends, her audience and pop culture.\n",
        "Though Nico Icon is replete with fascinating tidbits about the model-turned- singer's opinions and lovers, it does little to bring us understanding of the real person.\n",
        "The movie has no moral or message, does not attempt to rehabilitate Nico as an anti-heroine, and finds mostly emptiness and sadness in her life. I have a feeling Nico would have enjoyed it.\n",
        "though Penn doesn't always seem to know where he's going, his movie doesn't altogether miss its destination.\n",
        "Moore needs The Juror like she needs another scarlet letter; the 'D-for-dopey' here is hanging down to everyone's knees.\n",
        "By putting itself in sync with the rhythms of everyday life, it offers a reminder that the simplest forms of filmmaking can be the most satisfying.\n",
        "We need to fall in love with Razieh to see the film properly, and we do.\n",
        "Panahi has much the same kind of talent, a concern to make his film a kind of home for its characters, but he has not yet found [Kiarostami's] secret, how to find and hold the still point of the turning world.\n",
        "Raziah takes everything at face value, forcing us to look again at people and situations we would immediately judge as good or bad -- reason enough to see this film.\n",
        "Panahi brings film back to its elemental magic.\n",
        "There are LONG stretches of... well, real time.\n",
        "Those with the patience to sit through all eighty-five minutes will uncover a sublime, unconventionally engrossing story.\n",
        "Yet another debut about urban lowlifes filmed by wanna-be Tarantinos, Denver boasts a distinctive personality and a colorful cast that any police lineup would be proud to call its own.\n",
        "Odd feminist fun.\n",
        "Written and directed with quirky charm by Marleen Gorris.\n",
        "Pleasant, if too-precious.\n",
        "This is the rare film that does actually succeed in suggesting the experience of a lifetime.\n",
        "Gorris has fashioned a rare and wonderful world capable of provoking both laughter and tears -- sometimes at the same time.\n",
        "Even if [Gorris] is too optimistic, I am glad her movie made me feel hopeful and cheerful.\n",
        "It's an ambitious project, this telling of a whole life as well as its consequences, and Gorris manages to pull it off.\n",
        "Antonia is obviously our point person here, but she's such a sour pickle that you never get to ease into her story.\n",
        "Based on Clifton Taulbert's book, this sensitive memory film about the author's coming of age in the segregated South is an emotionally quiet saga, plaved against a tumultuous era in black communal life.\n",
        "Though the film exhibits a vaguely nostalgic tone, it's hardly sugar-coated, displaying an increasingly discernible edge to its portrayal of racist realities.\n",
        "No matter what you think this adaptation of A.S. Byatt's novella Morpho Eugenia sounds like, it's better and certainly kinkier than your best parlor-game guess.\n",
        "The filmmakers take a rather facile, anachronistic \"Oprah\"-esque approach toward the boys' feelings about their families and the Skipper's role as a \"tough love\"-minded surrogate father.\n",
        "This particular landlubber felt like jelly for the rest of the day, notwithstanding the hokey courtroom showdown that closes the picture.\n",
        "Despite great scenery, the distinctive visual ideas of Mr. Scott (Alien, Blade Runner) and the strong dramatic presence of Mr. Bridges, most of White Squall remains listless and tame.\n",
        "Typically, Bridges gives a deftly understated performance uncluttered by vanity or shallow pathos. No wonder he's not a star.\n",
        "The 20 or so minutes we spend with the Albatross in the squall is high adventure, to be sure. Everything else is ballast.\n",
        "Far too much of this handsomely mounted adventure is devoted to routinely dramatized adolescent minutiae.\n",
        "The heavy-handedness of these final scenes will probably ruin the movie for some people, while others will enjoy its earnestness and energy. Count me among the latter group.\n",
        "Director Ridley Scott, who more than anyone else founded post-1960s visceral filmmaking, is at the top of his form in White Squall.\n",
        "The movie's a shipload of coming-of-age blather, supplemented with enough rolling-sea footage to make the audience yearn for both Dramamine and a decent drowning scene.\n",
        "This film offers just about everything, including a twenty-minute white-knuckle sequence and a chance to shed a few tears. In short, it's first-rate entertainment.\n",
        "Although only slightly more than two hours, the film seems becalmed for days in what seems a dramatic doldrum.\n",
        "I enjoyed the movie for the sheer physical exuberance of its adventure.\n",
        "This rousing salute to the power of the elements, the lost innocence of the Kennedy era, and the goodness of young men when they are allowed to ripen with their shirts off is, above all, a tone poem.\n",
        "It's a first-class, stylish farce with a brisk pace and cool wit.\n",
        "An unruly orangutan plus an opulent hotel setting equals a natural disaster, or in this case a kids' movie.\n",
        "There isn't much of a story. The minimal plot exists exclusively to get the orangutan Dunston (played by \"Sam\") into as many odd, potentially-comic circumstances as possible.\n",
        "The performances may be uneven, but the flawed characters are believable, the sheep surprisingly scary and the animal antics often laugh-out-loud funny.\n",
        "This lurid lunacy from New Zealand is a horror-humor cross-breed of animal lore and giddy gore.\n",
        "Anyone lacking a taste for red meat will likely say bah to the one-joke juiciness of Black Sheep, but ovine enthusiasts will be licking their chops.\n",
        "Stunning vistas of New Zealand's rolling countryside aren't enough to carry this lame 2006 horror spoof about a lab experiment gone awry.\n",
        "The most gruesomely satisfying spectacle for hard-core environmentalists would be that of a group of foreign investors in the evil enterprise being gobbled up by a flock of rampaging sheep.\n",
        "...Black Sheep never rises above sensation and splatter, or goes beyond the one thing it does best: It bites.\n",
        "Black Sheep is never very frightening, but it's clever and fun, with a memorable amount of humor and gore. Imagine if the Monty Python folks made the killer rabbit part from Holy Grail into a full-length movie.\n",
        "Like Snakes on a Plane, the whole movie is essentially contained within the title. All the picture itself does is to repeat that concept for 87 minutes.\n",
        "It's the Triumph of the Lambs.\n",
        "I suspect [director Jonathan] King's next film will be better.\n",
        "A strenuous goof, one that will test your tolerance for the violence of the lambs.\n",
        "I pretty much hated it. Like the zombie spoof Fido from a couple of weeks ago, this is a one-joke movie -- and the one joke gets old fast.\n",
        "Only a 12-year-old boy would view this collection of squishy grotesqueries and squirting arteries as perfect Friday-night entertainment.\n",
        "Black Sheep is essentially a silly, grisly elaboration of a simple idea: What if sheep started feasting on human flesh and turning their victims into huge ovine zombies?\n",
        "A one-joke skit that trots in a straight line, and your enjoyment of it will depend entirely on how many times you need to see gonzo sheep rip out human entrails.\n",
        "Rife with bloody gore and funny gags.\n",
        "It's still relatively early in 2007, but this wry comedy about sheep gone baaaaad promises to be the best vampire-flesh-eating livestock movie of the year.\n",
        "Absurdly, magnificently gruesome.\n",
        "The most preposterous movie in theaters isn't the Ace Ventura sequel (or even Money Train) but this wanna-be nail-biter.\n",
        "The film is too mannered, too stuffy.\n",
        "Sluggish and interminable, Mary Reilly makes good on little of its potential to be disturbing and none of its chance to be emotionally involving.\n",
        "Unfortunately, your response to the bizarre story of terror and lust that dare not speak their name is pretty well limited to Roberts' response -- which is, in turn, limited by her technique.\n",
        "A perversely courageous disaster that audiences will simply hate.\n",
        "Mary Reilly works as Gothic melodrama because it understands the genre so well.\n",
        "The story lacks purpose.\n",
        "Director Frears seems more interested in the atmosphere than the narrative.\n",
        "Mary Reilly is haunting, not only because of its foggy, shadowy settings, but because of the questions it encourages us to ask about ourselves and others.\n",
        "Vampire in Brooklyn is neither funny nor frightening and comes up a tedious middle-road hybrid from veteran scaremeister Wes Craven, who directed.\n",
        "Neither as good as it might be nor as bad as you might expect.\n",
        "To call this a comedy is a sign of optimism; to call it a comeback for Murphy is a sign of blind faith.\n",
        "Murphy's pale efforts are enough to make one fondly recall Blacula. Now that was one sucker who knew how to make a film that didn't.\n",
        "They're no match, though, for the crushing disappointment of having to watch Murphy on the comic sidelines. It's like going to a Barbra Streisand concert and being asked to listen with her while the rhythm section sings.\n",
        "Doesn't live up to its promise or premise.\n",
        "This modern fable is little more than a Murphy potboiler, something to while away a couple of hours, rather than fondly remember.\n",
        "Craven can't keep the comic elements in balance with the horror, and as a result there's no tension or dramatic pull.\n",
        "Beautiful Girls is always in touch with reality but never drowned in it.\n",
        "This startlingly uneventful compendium of thick-headed boy-talk and female tolerance squanders a fine cast on incredibly ordinary characters and situations.\n",
        "Women may be unimpressed, but men will squirm with recognition.\n",
        "It's the women who break the monotony of this dudes-in-flux saga...\n",
        "In a relationship that skirts bad taste, Hutton and Portman make tender movie magic, giving this big-screen spin on Friends its only moments of true romantic yearning.\n",
        "The dialogue isn't the only problem with Beautiful Girls. The characters are bad, too.\n",
        "What's nicest about the film is the way it treasures the good feelings people can have for one another.\n",
        "Hutton, understated but not bland for a change, gives his best performance in years.\n",
        "Portman, a budding knockout, is scene-stealingly good even in an overly showy role.\n",
        "The movie is wry, touching and fun to sit through...\n",
        "Portman was memorable as the little girl in The Professional, but her work here throws off an eeriness in its revelation of such huge talent in one so young.\n",
        "Borrowing heavily from other, better films, director Ted Demme and screenwriter Scott Rosenberg give each of their male protagonists a case of commitment angst.\n",
        "The movie lacks the stature or consistency to be truly beautiful -- but you know, it is kind of cute.\n",
        "There is absolutely nothing going on in Beautiful Girls that you haven't seen... [in] any other artistic endeavor in which untethered young men and women, bound by geography and fortified by beer, shamble their way toward overdue maturity.\n",
        "Directed with the keen action instincts Woo brought to The Killer, Hard-Boiled and other cult causes from his career in Hong Kong.\n",
        "This small-scale, putatively comic meditation on the anxieties and joys of the theatrical life says nothing fresh about the artistic process and manages to be coy and grating in doing so.\n",
        "A palpable hit.\n",
        "A Midwinter's Tale\" packs together so many characters and ideas that they crowd one another out, leaving enough room for plenty of chuckles but none for belly laughs.\n",
        "Looked at coldly, as a piece of entertainment, it clearly doesn't satisfy. But as a personal statement from writer-director Kenneth Branagh, the film still isn't good . . . but it's interesting.\n",
        "There are so many laughs here, so much theatrical temperament on display, that you can't help but embrace the picture, even with its obvious flaws.\n",
        "[An] inoffensive trifle.\n",
        "Writer-director Mathieu Kassovitz mines so much tension and pointed dialogue from a low budget and deceptively simple premise that you wonder why so much of current Hollywood's own social realism ends up shooting $50 million blanks.\n",
        "Hate is, I suppose, a Generation X film, whatever that means, but more mature and insightful than the American Gen X movies.\n",
        "Jaglom's concentrated approach serves up some insight to be sure, but the movie states its case in the first 10 minutes and then proceeds to run out of things to say, almost as quickly as the women in this movie think they've run out of things to wear.\n",
        "Alleges support of women, yet fetishizes their objects instead of their relationships.\n",
        "[Henry] Jaglom's Going Shopping is a nifty little oddity, another of his unlikely, entertaining movie hybrids.\n",
        "It's the last and least successful of indie director Henry Jaglom's trilogy looking at female issues.\n",
        "The trouble with Going Shopping is that it's clogged with personalities and styles that don't congeal.\n",
        "Going Shopping can make a wonderful outing for girlfriends. It's fun.\n",
        "Going Shopping is sharp and funny about all the things that shopping can mean to the women who live to do it, and even to those who don't.\n",
        "At times movies seem rife with misogyny, yet Jaglom consistently expresses a love for women in his films.\n",
        "Inadvertently reduces women to a variety of cliches, probably reinforcing many men's worst fears.\n",
        "Not only is indulgence a frequent subject for Jaglom, it also sums up what his movies do -- and what they demand from their audience, sometimes to tedious degrees.\n",
        "None of these is a character you want to spend much time with, and even with the diverting guest appearances, this is still strictly discount merchandise.\n",
        "Comes as close as any film to explaining what the deal is with women and shopping.\n",
        "[Has] enough moments of insight to blunt charges of sexist stereotyping.\n",
        "Zeroes in on retail mania with a flimsy wire hanger of a premise.\n",
        "Going Shopping...has enough smart, knowing touches and enough easy spontaneity among its well-chosen actors to make you wish it added up to more than what it turns out to be: a flighty, motor-mouthed cinematic divertissement.\n",
        "Henry Jaglom completes his informal trilogy on estrogen-laced obsessions with this seriocomic exploration of women and clothes.\n",
        "Henry Jaglom's latest study of contemporary female obsessions among a noxious clan of West L.A. bourgeoisie is of more pathological than cinematic interest.\n",
        "Its chief pleasure is the acting of the big cast, notably Pacino. At 55, he has a haggard, life-wrestling beauty and a street eloquence that has more innocence than De Niro and more sincerity than Nicholson.\n",
        "A watchable but never pulsating portrait of mayoral wheeling-dealing.\n",
        "A confident, eccentric debut about a trio of shambling and guileless friends who become the Candides of crime, Rocket feels particularly refreshing because it never compromises on its delicate deadpan sensibility.\n",
        "[Bottle Rocket] meanders pleasantly, like a road movie, with a seventies-style, anything-goes offhandedness that whisks the audience through the rough spots.\n",
        "Bottle Rocket was conceived as a low-budget family affair -- it has more Wilsons than the Beach Boys -- and outside of a few cult-intensive pockets of fandom, that's where it's likely to end up.\n",
        "This is a movie about friendship, about foolhardy endeavors that get your adrenaline going and make you feel life buzzing in your toes. Written with wit and concision and remarkable confidence, Bottle Rocket is a joyride worth taking.\n",
        "Bottle Rocket is a beguiling surprise, a terrific little movie comedy about a slightly addled gang of young criminal wannabes.\n",
        "With a wild-card character like Dignan, he could be either the most original character in many a moon -- or never convincing. Wilson, with his cockeyed grin and rapid-fire delivery, comes off as a young Dennis Hopper.\n",
        "Wes Anderson's 1996 first feature (before Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums) is fresh, character driven, often funny, and unfashionably upbeat (as well as offbeat).\n",
        "The title refers to cheap fireworks that fizz before they flame out quietly, and that's what three Southwestern slackers do in this amiable heist movie-cum-road flick.\n",
        "Even as you laugh at these guys, you feel an overwhelming sympathy for them. Sensing that they love each other, you want their dumb, dysfunctional lives to work out.\n",
        "Caan does a funny cameo as the local crimelord but the film belongs to Anderson's co-conspirator Wilson, whose wired performance leaps off the screen.\n",
        "Full of surprising warmth and charm, unexpected plot turns and droll characters that bounce off each other in refreshing ways, this genre-defying Columbia pickup may struggle to overcome its lack of an obvious marketing handle.\n",
        "Starts and finishes strong, but, somewhere in the middle, it loses its focus and its way.\n",
        "A hilarious, inventive and goofy breath of fresh air.\n",
        "A grueling, numbing black hole.\n",
        "I can't recommend the film -- it's too unwound and indulgent -- but I have a certain affection for it, and I'm looking forward to whatever Anderson and the Wilsons do next.\n",
        "A mildly facetious tone limits Anderson's film to the lightweight, but the collective enthusiasm behind this debut effort still comes through.\n",
        "A little deal, this movie is like a bottle rocket itself: a big bang for the money.\n",
        "Gets by on quirky charm and slacker chic -- but just barely.\n",
        "The hip, smart yarn has a bite not seen in American movies since The War of the Roses.\n",
        "A dreadful movie.\n",
        "This is a romantic comedy parody, but how can you satirize something that's a comedy to begin with? If this motion picture is an example, not only can't it be done, but the result is downright ugly.\n",
        "A sour, listless debunking of romantic comedies.\n",
        "Like its title character, Mr. Wrong doesn't know when to quit.\n",
        "As directed sloppily by Nick Castle, this comedy barely lets its main characters develop, even though either of them could be great fun.\n",
        "Pullman, who can usually shade a character so subtly between sweetie and sucker, is made to veer manically into jerkhood for no particular reason except that the filmmakers couldn't come up with anything smarter to propel this galumphing caper along.\n",
        "A B-grade murder mystery with a sci-fi twist.\n",
        "[A] one-joke Caddyshack for the blitzed and jaded.\n",
        "There are about three minutes of funny material in Happy Gilmore, and pretty much all of them are in the trailer.\n",
        "Superior disposable comedy.\n",
        "It may smell awful from a distance, especially if you have low tolerance for lowbrow humor, but up close this yarn about an unlikely golf star is fairly painless.\n",
        "You don't feel that Sandler and director Dennis Dugan are trying for the kind of subversiveness that might just make Happy's brutal anarchy more effective.\n",
        "Happy's tantrums, which the movie pretends are liberating explosions of self-expression, aren't nearly maniacal enough to reach comic delirium.\n",
        "Sandler plays this a lot smarter than, say, a Jim Carrey character, and with less slapstick. Still, this is not delicate, subtle stuff: It's smart low-brow, and only for those who like their humor a bit offbeat.\n",
        "The story has all the thickness of a well-trimmed green, but it's a decent excuse for some heady sight gags.\n",
        "The Happy Gilmore character is strange. I guess we are supposed to like him.\n",
        "Happy Gilmore may not be an ace in the hole, but it beats par by a long shot.\n",
        "Sandler's movie is worth a few laughs, but not many of the comic sequences are original, and even fewer are inspired.\n",
        "With Eastwood as Kincaid and Meryl Streep as Francesca, this carefully observant love story turns Waller's pop-lit passion into screen art.\n",
        "Bridges is an admirable achievement, one that probably does more to reposition its maker as someone who can carry a movie without carrying a gun than as the director/star of a Love Story for the Loving Care set.\n",
        "The result, if rather thin and certainly far from a masterpiece, is nevertheless quite lovely. This affecting little film is easily one of Eastwood's best efforts as a director.\n",
        "The two leads' sly comic rhythm is miles removed from the book's failing solemnity.\n",
        "Eastwood's Bridges has the energy and spontaneity of a picture that was shot quickly. And that serves the material well, because it removes the solemnity that could stiffle a modern classic.\n",
        "Despite all his craft and sincerity, [Eastwood] and screenwriter Richard LaGravenese can't quite turn Robert James Waller's cardboard best-seller into flesh and bone.\n",
        "Bridges is an old-fashioned \"women's film\" that pits the heroine's romantic urges against her matriarchal duties. In fact, the film is at its dramatic best when Francesca is finally obliged, like Sophie, to make her choice.\n",
        "Streep makes her character known in no time flat. Intelligence, humor, blocked ambition, self-irony -- they're all contained in Francesca's quick response when Robert asks if she has any plans for the afternoon.\n",
        "Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood, as Waller's tenderly plaintive heartland lovers, are so visually and spiritually right they seem to have walked right off the page.\n",
        "What follows is, essentially, gothic-romantic bunk. But there's a nicely stylized, below-the-surface courtship between the performers. They make you forget that, at their very core, they are hackneyed creations.\n",
        "Madison County is Eastwood's gift to women: to Francesca, to all the girls he's loved before -- and to Streep, who alchemizes literary mawkishness into intelligent movie passion.\n",
        "Given the intelligent restraint of the treatment, this is about as fine an adaptation of this material as one could hope for...\n",
        "Immaculately performed, and assembled with wit and sensitivity, this is one of the most satisfying weepies in years.\n",
        "Limited by the vapidity of this material while he trims its excesses with the requisite machete, Mr. Eastwood locates a moving, elegiac love story at the heart of Mr. Waller's self-congratulatory overkill.\n",
        "What the movie does that the book couldn't do is tap into the poignancy that comes of seeing two stars who used to be young and beautiful suddenly looking very mortal.\n",
        "Screenwriter LaGravenese ought to get the Croix de Guerre for doing battle with Waller's fatuous prose and paring Bridges down to its most appealing fantasy romance essence.\n",
        "The Bridges of Madison County is a beautiful film, not only in the way it was photographed, but for the manner through which the characters are revealed to us.\n",
        "I've seen the movie twice now and was even more involved the second time, because I was able to pay more attention to the nuances of voice and gesture.\n",
        "The gap between touchy-feely and touching isn't easy to span, so credit judicious pruning on the one hand and a beefed-up script on the other for getting perhaps the best possible movie out of Robert James Waller's The Bridges of Madison County.\n",
        "Geena Davis and Renny Harlin couldn't cut it with Cutthroat Island. Steven Spielberg nearly got the hook for Hook. But leave it to Miss Piggy and Kermit to discover uncharted gold in the shipwrecked-pirate genre.\n",
        "As the star of the new, epic-scaled Braveheart, Gibson celebrates yet another man of selfless valor. And as its director, he displays some daring of his own.\n",
        "A lavish, entertaining spectacle full of manly men, dastardly villains, rousing battles and women who easily see Mel's hero potential through all that messy hair.\n",
        "In addition to staging battle scenes well, Gibson also manages to recreate the filth and mood of 700 years ago.\n",
        "Mel Gibson throws his whole heart into a role. No one acts with more conviction, and his errors are honest ones.\n",
        "Braveheart has a gut-wrenching, bone-breaking, sword-thwacking verve.\n",
        "Many movies deal with battlefield heroics. Few seriously attempt to define heroism.\n",
        "In this mix of historical tragedy and hip adventure, Gibson may be as galvanic a movie swashbuckler as Errol Flynn and Burt Lancaster were in their day.\n",
        "The political argument that ensues is pretty dull, but the battle scenes are the loudest and most convincing in years: Gibson has learned from Kurosawa in lending a clarifying thrust to what is, essentially, chaos.\n",
        "Braveheart looks like a true epic -- even if it is both bloody and bloody long.\n",
        "A huge, bloody and sprawling epic, Braveheart is the sort of massive vanity piece that would be easy to disparage if it didn't essentially deliver.\n",
        "Pure hokum.\n",
        "Though the film dawdles a bit with the shimmery, dappled love stuff involving Wallace with a Scottish peasant and a French princess, the action will pin you to your seat.\n",
        "As a filmmaker, [Gibson] lacks the epic gift, but the movie, scripted by Randall (no relation) Wallace, works on a fairly basic level as a hiss-the-English medieval Western.\n",
        "Braveheart opts to turn cowardly, settling for the magnification of Gibson's idol status, forfeiting the complex, more nebulous magnificence of the real Sir William Wallace and virtually excising the strategic brilliance of Robert The Bruce.\n",
        "At times the film seems an obsessive ode to Mel Gibson machismo.\n",
        "Gibson's raw energy and storytelling power in Braveheart are undeniable. If the film doesn't meet his ambitions, it's because he set the bar so high.\n",
        "With its clashing armies, heartstopping action, and grand sense of romance, this is the sort of film it's a pleasure to see and review.\n",
        "An action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of The Road Warrior.\n",
        "One of the most spectacular entertainments in years.\n",
        "Everybody knows that a non-blubbering clause is standard in all movie stars' contracts. Too bad there isn't one banning self-indulgence when they direct.\n",
        "Chan's insistence on his own fallibility and vulnerability, taken with virtuoso scenes like the fight involving 101 domestic appliances, shows why he means more to his countless fans than six US action stars put together.\n",
        "It's light on plot and character, but the stunts are well staged.\n",
        "For once a film's ad line has a whiff of truth about it: 'No Fear. No Stuntman. No Equal.'\n",
        "The fun of Rumble in the Bronx is watching Chan build up one inventive and off-the-wall action scene after another.\n",
        "An awkward hybrid of Asian and American film techniques.\n",
        "The whole point is Jackie Chan - and, like Astaire and Rogers, he does what he does better than anybody.\n",
        "It's not often you find a movie as exciting and awful as Rumble in the Bronx.\n",
        "Unlike most action stars, Chan understands acting. His face is as flexible as his body, and, when he's moving, he's like a violent, supercharged combination of Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, and Buster Keaton.\n",
        "You can smirk at Rumble and deny its pedigree with some justification, as long as you concede that it's 10 times more fun to watch than Before and After and Mary Reilly put together.\n",
        "Awe-inspiring.\n",
        "The very medium of the moving picture exists to create the suspension of disbelief, and there is no greater live performer than Chan to make us believe you can beat up a street gang with a linen jacket and refrigerators.\n",
        "A giddy triple somersault of a film that makes no sense whatsoever, although in its best moments it is as much fun to watch as a death-defying circus act.\n",
        "More than a martial arts whiz, the 41-year-old Chan possesses the comic timing of a born clown, the grace of a Broadway hoofer and the daredevil bravado of an Evel Knievel.\n",
        "As the star cheerfully camouflages massive bandages on a twisted ankle, we also get a glimpse of just how far Chan is willing to go to please his audience.\n",
        "As the guy who cleans up a ghetto, helps a crippled kid and does battle with a rampaging Hovercraft, Chan shows off the muscle of a superhero and the charm of a deft comedian.\n",
        "Chan, doing everything at once including all his own stunts, has an infectious energy that will help to remind you why you love movies.\n",
        "Despite Meryl Streep, Liam Neeson and the usually estimable Edward Furlong, this nonevent huffs and puffs to attain even the level of an ordinary motion picture.\n",
        "New insignts about Anne's spicy personality and immense curiosity are revealed by Holocaust survivors Hanneli Goslar and particularly Miep Gies, an office employee of Anne's father who was one of the main helpers to the families in hiding.\n",
        "Just when you might well have thought that pretty much all had been said and done about Anne Frank, this film makes us realize how much there still is to know about her and her times.\n",
        "Remarkable, deeply moving work that attempts to answer the haunting question, Who was Anne Frank?\n",
        "If the story of each of Hitler's victims was told with the sensitivity and power of Anne Frank Remembered, there would not be enough buckets in the world to hold all the tears.\n",
        "Anne's story of courage in the face of horrendous circumstances is a fine legacy, and Anne Frank Remembered reaffirms how relevant her message is today.\n",
        "The film's accumulated force is a testament to the power of understatement.\n",
        "Anne Frank Remembered tells the audience very little about Anne, but the film speaks volumes concerning the problematic aspects of Holocaust representation.\n",
        "In the film's most extraordinary discovery, we see the only existing film footage of Anne Frank, taken one day in 1941, before the Franks went into hiding.\n",
        "If this is not the best film about the Holocaust, it does strongly chronicle the sad fate of one of its most famous victims.\n",
        "The interviews constitute the emotional backbone. The mere existence of these survivors is eloquent testimony to events so cruel they defy belief.\n",
        "Of all the movies and television productions that have told her story, this is the most valuable and satisfying.\n",
        "In retracing the short life and grotesque death of the century's best known diarist, Anna Frank, it has its own private dignity.\n",
        "A tender, elaborately detailed account of a life curtailed.\n",
        "The film adds little to previous factual knowledge, but it deepens our connections with the story through the power of film itself.\n",
        "A bleak, annoyingly quirky Gen-X recasting of the When Harry Met Sally notion that true love is based on friendship.\n",
        "All coy grins and daffy mugging, Mr. Stiller plays the role as if aspiring to become the Elliott Gould of his generation. Compared with jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge, that's a reasonable goal.\n",
        "If Lucy Fell is funnier more often than not, and when it's not being funny it's at least being strange. I'll take strange over what most major-distributor comedies are when they're not being funny.\n",
        "There is an affectation that I find particularly annoying, and that is when people choose to perform at a level below their natural intelligence.\n",
        "It's airy, fluffy and ultimately uninteresting.\n",
        "If Lucy Fell should be a chore, and yet I kept catching myself having a good time.\n",
        "Sadly, the story is nowhere as original as the details and performances.\n",
        "A disappointingly superficial romantic comedy. There's no chemistry between any of the characters. The acting is mediocre, with Schaeffer and Parker exhibiting no screen presence.\n",
        "Overlong and overreaching.\n",
        "In Boomerang Eddie Murphy straitjackets himself in an ill-fitting comedy vehicle that's desperately in need of a reality check.\n",
        "The general idea is to exploit a certain amount of role reversal, and Reginald Hudlin, who directed House Party, does a fairly good job of making this fun.\n",
        "The film is far too slick to be ineffective, but its attempts to play with the sex-war theme are often unbelievably crass.\n",
        "There's something paradoxical about the ease he radiates in playing a man who is supposed to be a smashing success. As an underdog, Mr. Murphy worked much harder.\n",
        "For all the sex talk in Boomerang, there's very little nudity. The only thing naked is Murphy's vanity.\n",
        "Boomerang is the funniest, most sophisticated movie of Eddie Murphy's career.\n",
        "Whatever [Murphy] was thinking during the dark days of his career slump, it seems to have paid off handsomely.\n",
        "Murphy gives his most appealing performance to date, using his smug, self-satisfied, sly smile as a joke on his own well-known screen persona.\n",
        "As fresh as falling rain, a pair of love stories full of pain and humor.\n",
        "It's interesting enough to watch for most of its length because of Wong's incisive camera work and his intense immersion of the Hong Kong night culture.\n",
        "This is the kind of movie you'll relate to if you love film itself, rather than its surface aspects such as story and stars.\n",
        "Once the viewer gets past bouts of confusion (the film demands more than one viewing), the result is a uniquely memorable look at the ties that bind all people.\n",
        "A frenetic one-way ride through The Land of Vaporous Plot, with stops along the way at Irritatingly Cute Extended Metaphor City.\n",
        "More impressive than engaging.\n",
        "The movie is not as special as Cinema Paradiso, but in its own way it is enchanted, too. Mother of God, what faces.\n",
        "The central story, belatedly introduced, may prove rudely downbeat for viewers who lapped up Paradiso's sentiment.\n",
        "David O. Russell has a twisted mind; I like that in a man.\n",
        "This whacked-out road comedy about a young man's search for his real parents takes any number of unexpected turns, most of them bitingly funny.\n",
        "The neurotic frenzy threatens to annoy, but Russell's edgy, abbreviated style generates farcical comic friction without sacrificing character.\n",
        "There are conventions in this sort of story, and Russell seems to violate most of them. He allows the peculiarities of his characters to lead them away from the plot line and into perplexities of their own.\n",
        "Hang on and prepare to laugh continually.\n",
        "The perpetual motion is a deliciously hysterical rush. This offbeat, documentary-like comedy becomes geometrically funnier as it goes along.\n",
        "[A] wonderfully mad odyssey of a movie, in which a man sets out to find his biological parents and winds up meeting more weirdos than Alice found down the rabbit hole.\n",
        "The film isn't wrenching enough to do it justice.\n",
        "If Parker had aimed more at capturing the author's unique voice, and worried less about getting the details right, his movie might have been extraordinary.\n",
        "There is in the film a beauty and ambition rare in most current movies.\n",
        "Mostly misses the humor, lyricism and emotional charge of Frank McCourt's magical and magnificent memoir.\n",
        "Watson, the queen of suffering-female roles, is as good as ever.\n",
        "Angela's Ashes is the soggiest dud of all the major holiday releases.\n",
        "Mostly it's a series of visits to the welfare line.\n",
        "Lacking a heart.\n",
        "The film is too often trapped in its own reverence and solemnity.\n",
        "I'm sure the producers of Angela's Ashes meant well, but they got the wrong guy to direct it.\n",
        "As well-crafted and sensitive as it is, the movie remains one step removed from inspiration.\n",
        "Primitive peoples, or so it's said, resist being photographed, believing that the creation of an image robs them of their souls. A quaint notion, perhaps, but how else can you explain what's happened to Angela's Ashes?\n",
        "For all its fidelity to the spirit and, in extended passages, to the letter of McCourt's book, however, Parker's film falls short.\n",
        "There's a compelling momentum to Angela's Ashes, Alan Parker's very faithful, if poetically subordinate, version of McCourt's book, which imposed elegance on squalor and intelligence on the indolence cultivated by poverty.\n",
        "It's good-natured, innocuous frivolity that should raise a few smiles and generate good but not great spring box office.\n",
        "he construction is so ramshackle (or the mood so PC) that the film-makers put a woman (Holly) on board, then can't find a thing to do with her.\n",
        "A soggy sub sandwich layered with cheesy action, stale jokes and gung-ho baloney.\n",
        "The tone of the acting, which is set by Mr. Grammer's blandly laid-back performance, is all wrong for a genre that demands over-the-top hamming.\n",
        "More laid-back here than he is on television, Grammer seems to barely break a sweat.\n",
        "After that auspicious opening, it sinks.\n",
        "There are occasional laughs, but, as with most movies that think they're funnier than they actually are, most of the jokes fall flat.\n",
        "Levinson has written and directed in many genres. But rarely has he made a film as indecisive and diffident as Man of the Year.\n",
        "A surprisingly complex and dark satire that skewers the media as well as the political process.\n",
        "Man of the Year makes telling points and has a lot to say, but it loses its voice along with its consistency around the mid-way point, and that will likely make it an also-ran in the box office race.\n",
        "It's a comedy, a political thriller, a love story: Barry Levinson's Man of the Year tries to be all things to all people and fails on every count -- a little like the generic, ineffectual politicians it's pretending to excoriate.\n",
        "A few observations about the hollowness of party politics, plus Robin Williams doing lots of funny shtick as a Jon Stewart-like comic running for president, have been thrown together with low regard for logic or consistent tone.\n",
        "Barry Levinson's Man of the Year squanders a promising premise; it's ultimately overlong, underwritten and strangely unfunny.\n",
        "A genre-less, imaginative riff by an intelligent filmmaker on the state of the country.\n",
        "It's a nearly tone-deaf satire of American politics and the culture of celebrity, a comedy without enough laughs, a satire without enough bite.\n",
        "Only in filmmaking does one very good idea plus another very good idea sometimes add up to one less-than-great picture.\n",
        "Man of the Year is longer than the FDR administration, less funny than Calvin Coolidge and deader than Abe Lincoln.\n",
        "A few moments do not make a new Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Frank Capra can continue to rest in peace.\n",
        "The second half of Man of the Year bears practically no relation to the irreverent comedy the movie's trailer sells you -- much like a politician who doesn't keep any of the promises that lured you to vote for him.\n",
        "Man of the Year isn't Movie of the Year. It might have been an ironic condemnation of electoral fraud and the malignant sway of corporate profits. But for a while, anyway, it had my vote.\n",
        "Man of the Year is a moderately funny little movie that isn't pointed enough to successfully skewer its political targets.\n",
        "Man of the Year is a well-intentioned mess, a dated, yuk-it-up sloppy civics lesson with such a lack of conviction that it backs away from the very questions it poses.\n",
        "No one will mistake Man of the Year for movie of the year, but it says some things worth being said without the usual straight face.\n",
        "Man of the Year starts out funny -- at least that's the intention -- and then morphs into a kind of paranoid thriller. Neither one of the movie's split personalities is particularly good.\n",
        "There's a Preston Sturges lesson in Man of the Year: Entertaining folks is its own civic duty. At times, making citizens laugh (and think) might be the most honorable profession of all.\n",
        "A disappointing American debut of the Hong Kong cult director John Woo is a decent action vehicle by standards of its star Jean-Claude Van Damme but, hampered by a B script and flat characters, it doesn't bear Woo's auteurist signature and unique vision\n",
        "It's what Hollywood wanted Woo for: bigger, brighter explosions.\n",
        "Presenting Mr. Van Damme as reverentially as Sergio Leone did the young Clint Eastwood, Mr. Woo displays a real aptitude for malignant mischief, which is this story's stock in trade.\n",
        "Even when the acting is hammy, notably Wilford Brimley's turn as Chance's Cajun uncle, Woo stages every fight with hypnotic grace.\n",
        "Woo, a master of stylized violence and explosive action, has had to buy into America's fascination with explosive effects and reaction. Something gets lost in the transition.\n",
        "Its characters are poorly-developed, the plot is the pinnacle of absurdity, and the acting, at best, is well over-the-top. Nevertheless, on the most basic, visceral level, the film succeeds.\n",
        "Essentially, Hard Target is a risk-averse Van Damme vehicle, steered by many hands, and set on tracks leading directly to the delivery entrances of the country's video stores.\n",
        "Is it worse as a love story or as a drama about the sorry state of television news? The answer: It's a tie.\n",
        "This is one of those untaxing time-killers where you spend a lot of time pondering which of its actress's changing hairstyles you like best.\n",
        "This isn't the supreme masterpiece it might have been, but Nichols's direction is very polished and some of the lines and details are awfully funny.\n",
        "If The Birdcage isn't exactly the Mike Nichols-Elaine May movie of our dreams, it does manage to transform what was formerly a campy bit of French fluff into one of the loopiest, most hysterical family-values movies ever made.\n",
        "The Birdcage is a scream.\n",
        "It doesn't so much champion diversity as celebrate conformity.\n",
        "A glossy miscalculation with Nathan Lane and Robin Williams.\n",
        "Basically, the movie's an extended setup for a dinner-table comedy of errors, in which the mismatched relatives confront one another in a nerve-racking test of appearances.\n",
        "One of those rare motion pictures with side-splitting laughs where the humor never stays dormant for long.\n",
        "Far less plastic than most cross-dressing comedies.\n",
        "What makes Mike Nichols' version more than just a retread is good casting in the key roles, and a wicked screenplay by Elaine May, who keeps the original story but adds little zingers here and there.\n",
        "An American remake with plenty of new pizazz.\n",
        "The beauty of The Birdcage is that its jokes and its message are one and the same. These characters couldn't change themselves if they tried. And only a fool would want them to.\n",
        "The cops never seem to know what they're doing, but then neither do the filmmakers, though I can't imagine that casual audiences will care since there are plenty of big explosions at the end to reward them.\n",
        "Even when it's not particularly funny, their interplay is engaging, and their lively, raucous personalities keep the proceedings punchy and watchable for the slightly overlong running time.\n",
        "Unfortunately, the movie is a couple of rewrites short of 'developed', and the thriller configurations are stale.\n",
        "This film isn't aiming for high-toned drama, just high-energy entertainment, which is what it delivers.\n",
        "It's all special-effects noise and nonsense.\n",
        "Given how much good Bad Boys is going to do for Martin Lawrence's feature career, it's a pity the film couldn't do any more for itself.\n",
        "A good half-hour's worth of nonsense in the middle keeps Bad Boys from being little better than a break- even proposition.\n",
        "This movie is so good-looking it deserves a decent screenplay, instead of one more lope down memory lane.\n",
        "Even by the low-low standards of cheap action flicks, this one's bad, boys.\n",
        "Bad Boys is relentless formulaic fodder for the explosion-starved; it's loud, shallow, sexist and a complete waste of time.\n",
        "Bad Boys takes the often-traveled road, and leads the audience to a dead end.\n",
        "Of course, the Simpson-Bruckheimer approach may still work at the box office (the only place it ever really mattered, anyway). By now, though, I'd like to think most moviegoers have had a permanent overdose.\n",
        "Harmless family fare might be deemed politically correct for its concern for endangered species, but whitewashing of Chinese regime will strike adults... as somewhat bizarre.\n",
        "Pandas are many things. Adorable fuzzballs. Voracious eaters. Vanishing species. But, as actors, they are black and white and dull all over, which The Amazing Panda Adventure demonstrates all too well.\n",
        "For those few soul-freezing moments, you get a glimpse of the great actor Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be.\n",
        "Significantly, the movie keeps the hero's reformation offscreen as well as unexplained; it's more interested in shock effects than in candor or elucidation.\n",
        "The angel-faced DiCaprio is a gifted actor, but he lacks the authority and physical presence to keep us with him.\n",
        "The star shines, but the movie is hard to watch.\n",
        "You leave The Basketball Diaries believing that Leonardo DiCaprio can do anything.\n",
        "Although it masquerades as a cautionary tale about the horrors of heroin, this epic of teen-age angst is more accurately seen as a reverential wallow in the gutter of self-absorption.\n",
        "Facile escapes are rejected, and the resolution is acceptable because we can believe it. In fact, that's the reason this film works as well as it does: credibility.\n",
        "DiCaprio goes as far into the hell of drug abuse as any actor ever has -- and comes out a star.\n",
        "A movie for masochists, an unrelentingly ugly 'Just Say No' propaganda movie, it might have been bankrolled by Nancy Reagan.\n",
        "Amazingly, though, even with Kalvert's lack of style and vision, the greatness of DiCaprio's performance is undiminished.\n",
        "Will there ever be a market for a movie about a character who hurries past his drug phase because he can't wait to tell you what he did after he pulled his act together? Probably not.\n",
        "DiCaprio has so much presence that he almost saves the day, but this is a movie that'll make you want to opt for Jim Carrey's The Basketball Diaries.\n",
        "It ranges from awkward to excruciating.\n",
        "This sort of thing was done much better by the British years ago in The Full Monty and Calendar Girls. There's really no call for an American rehash.\n",
        "Do not waste your time with The Amateurs.\n",
        "There are no laughs to be found in writer-director Michael Traeger's would-be comedy The Amateurs, but there is one big mystery: how actors of this caliber could have been convinced to take part.\n",
        "As a writer, Traeger is consternatingly adolescent and glib.\n",
        "You'll notice that the actors are way overqualified for this nonsense. But the kick they get out of one another is what pulls you in.\n",
        "If there's something hypocritically coy about a sex comedy without sex (let alone a porn industry without victims), there's also something refreshing about the characters' unabashed good nature -- at least until the grievously saccharine finale.\n",
        "Even if you know how it all turned out (and you should), this amazing journey is harrowing and exhilarating.\n",
        "The film succeeds brilliantly at organizing great gobs of information into powerful drama.\n",
        "Hanks is a terrific choice for the lead because he can appear strong and military without slipping over into Sgt. Rock corniness.\n",
        "Apollo 13, one of the most exciting adventure movies of the year, proves that science history can be just as thrilling as science fiction.\n",
        "Howard is not above pushing buttons of his own and milking the big moments. But they are indeed big moments, and the manipulation is not intrusive. He has made a can-do movie for our can't-do age.\n",
        "The film, despite its raggedness, is stirring. In the end, this failed mission seems like the most impressive achievement of the entire space program: a triumph not of planning but of inspired improvisation.\n",
        "This meticulous but ultimately rather pedestrian drama gradually won me over as a minor if watchable example of the \"victory through defeat\" brand of military heroism that John Ford specialized in.\n",
        "Self-conscious about its heroism with portrayals that lean toward the glib and the professionally uplifting, the film milks our sympathies too readily to be emotionally convincing.\n",
        "This engrossing account of the nation's most perilous moon shot embodies what many people consider to be old-fashioned American virtues in a virtually pristine state.\n",
        "Apollo 13, Ron Howard's soaring salute to space exploration, lifts off with a payload of the right stuff-courage, can-do, grace under pressure and other qualities derided as machismo by some and applauded as old-fashioned values by others.\n",
        "Major, rousing, thoroughly professional Hollywood entertainment that will dazzle you with its re-creations of historical events, take you inside the space capsule and the Houston command center, and leave you wondering where our heroes [have gone].\n",
        "For a 'space movie', both the special effects and photography are surprisingly pedestrian. Where it scores is in subtly restating traditional notions of male heroism.\n",
        "Playing the tough, commanding Jim Lovell is a substantial stretch for Mr. Hanks, but as usual his seeming ingenuousness overshadows all else about the role. There's not a false move to anything he does on screen.\n",
        "If you thought Tom Hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star, wait until you've seen him eight stories tall.\n",
        "The special effects and many scenes of weightlessness look as good or better than in the original, while the Oscar-winning sound and James Horner's rousing score make good use of the hefty audio system.\n",
        "The re-release of Ron Howard's Apollo 13 in the IMAX format proves absolutely that really, really, really good things can come in enormous packages.\n",
        "On a purely pictorial level, this is one of the best-looking IMAX movies ever.\n",
        "Blowing up some 35mm films to an image 10 times larger could magnify their plot faults and performance shortcomings. But Apollo 13, with its taut cast, script and direction, profits from the process.\n",
        "It's a great American adventure and a wonderful film to bring to IMAX.\n",
        "It's easily Howard's best film.\n",
        "Rob Roy has its diversions, but they are unfortunately outweighed by some heavy baggage that contains not enough of substance.\n",
        "Neeson makes a less dashing action hero than did Day-Lewis, but he brings enough gravitas to his role to endow his love for his wife Mary (Lange) and his conflict with Cunningham with real emotional punch.\n",
        "Rob Roy is best watched for local color and for its hearty, hot-blooded stars.\n",
        "With such a cast and the setting of the Highlands, plus a story with a gold mine of dramatic potential, it is a puzzle why Rob Roy is so uninvolving.\n",
        "You always know where it's going even as it meanders for two and a half hours getting there.\n",
        "No more than moderately satisfying.\n",
        "Director Michael Caton-Jones and Sharp, both Scotsmen, are so caught up in the legend that they don't seem to notice that RR is about as heroic as a hatful of haggis.\n",
        "Strange. I thought I had seen enough sword fights in movies to last a lifetime, but I was wrong.\n",
        "As embodied by Liam Neeson, Rob Roy is a tremendous protagonist -- a naive man whose belief in honor and whose love for a woman, family, and clan make him a figure to cheer for.\n",
        "If you're in a forgiving, campy frame of mind (which I must have been the night I saw this), there's cheap pleasure to be gained from the experience.\n",
        "As a stand-alone film, this doesn't work; but viewed through the prism of the original, it offers some twisted, self-conscious pleasures.\n",
        "Stupefyingly lackluster.\n",
        "Like many sequels this is actually a remake, and it suffers from the law of diminishing returns.\n",
        "The plot, already mired in nonsensical backstory, collapses with the late-inning introduction of a tired metafictional device (not to mention a wildly lunging Usual Suspects twist).\n",
        "Basic Instinct 2 has a stylish look and a few sexy moments, but the plot goes from confusing to implausible to absolutely ludicrous in the final sequence.\n",
        "Even the ice pick looks like it really doesn't want to be there.\n",
        "The 1992 phenomenon was creepy, tense and sexually charged in a bold yet tawdry way. This sequel lacks even a shred of those elements.\n",
        "If you're trying to reinvigorate the art of the stylish thriller, the movie you come up with needs to be stylish and it needs to be thrilling. Basic Instinct 2, written by Leora Barish and Henry Bean and directed by Michael Caton-Jones, is neither.\n",
        "Despite all the heavy breathing and mood lighting, Basic Instinct 2 is so dull that you might find yourself easily distracted by side issues.\n",
        "What Basic Instinct 2 is missing, besides any of the trashy good fun of the original, is a subtitle. Here's a suggestion: A Girl's Guide to Dressing for Her Shrink.\n",
        "This film is unable to involve, entertain, or titillate. Basically, it stinks.\n",
        "Stone's purring, snarling, bedroom kink is embarrassing.\n",
        "But the movie is a baroque little mystery of so little mystery or consequence that you're literally sitting there waiting for the next full body cavity search.\n",
        "At this point, there are inflatable toys that are livelier than Stone, but how can you tell the difference? Basic Instinct 2 is not an erotic thriller. It's taxidermy.\n",
        "As with the first film, BI2 abounds with red herrings and misdirection, and comes up with an equally ambiguous Did she or didn't she? ending. But there are problems here beyond its staleness.\n",
        "Few expected Basic Instinct 2 to be very good, but no one expected it to be this boring.\n",
        "Using the same basic plot as 1992's original, BI2 feels less like a sequel than a remake whose shelf life has expired.\n",
        "The only real intrigue comes in the film's risky flirtation with high camp.\n",
        "The original movie lacked sense, but it did possess that sizzle. This one has neither.\n",
        "In the end, this is a movie that makes the original Basic Instinct look good. And in a way, that's quite a feat.\n",
        "In attempting to make its politics palatable as entertainment, the film has grafted them onto a boatload of Hollywood implausibilities whose excesses cripple believability.\n",
        "As an exercise in art, or even polemics, Beyond Rangoon is beyond redemption, but still works its occasional magic with extraordinary flair.\n",
        "Yet one more film -- that defines Third World political unrest through its effect on a white liberal.\n",
        "Boorman's metaphysical musings might work if he integrated them more fully into his film, instead of making them secondary to action sequences.\n",
        "A rare film, one that is intelligent, emotional and exciting.\n",
        "An odd movie, brilliant in places, but frustrating all the same.\n",
        "Because the film is well acted and directed, and the Malaysian locations are exotic and seductive, I got involved even though the story ... was so clearly concocted.\n",
        "Besides being an intelligent and gripping thriller with a solid grounding in real, recent historical events, Beyond Rangoon also gives movie-goers a rare opportunity to watch a female hero.\n",
        "The best thing you can say about this scattershot political satire is that the late John Candy's next-to-last picture is relatively funnier and less depressing than his valedictory Wagons East.\n",
        "A fairy tale with the soul of a rerun.\n",
        "It's not clear why Steven Spielberg's Amblin decided to make a live-action entertainment starring the least interesting and most saccharine of all 50s cartoon characters.\n",
        "Once the audience has become inured to the wide-eyed protagonist and impressive digitized effects, there's little sense of wonder or awe to be found.\n",
        "The set design, however, merely disguises what is in fact an intimate and likeable picture.\n",
        "Casper's movie is not the cleverest one around, but its hero may be the most lovable.\n",
        "This doesn't usually happen to me, but 15 minutes before the end of Casper I suddenly realized that if I didn't take a deep breath, I was going to start sobbing.\n",
        "As a technical achievement, it's impressive, and entertaining. And there is even a little winsome philosophy.\n",
        "As expected, it features extra-spectral effects, slews of celebrity guest shots and splendidly decorated sets. For all of that, though, the film is duller than a dead man's eyes.\n",
        "Without the talent of Ricci, Casper would have been a truly barren motion picture. As it is, it's still not very good.\n",
        "The horror, the horror.\n",
        "Casper moves like a dirge, especially when it sinks into a meditation on death a la Ghost. As specter spectacles go, Casper is a bit of a ghost bust.\n",
        "There is a force and focus in Lee's work, an absence of intellectual posturing and a willingness to let his material speak for itself that he has not achieved before.\n",
        "The performances are strong, but the spectator often feels adrift in an overly busy intrigue.\n",
        "A study of the urban dope-dealing culture and its toll on everyone who comes in contact with it, the picture has an insider's feel that is constantly undercut by the filmmaker's impulse to editorialize.\n",
        "The result is a more sober, mournful and meditative expressionism than you'd expect. That's not to say the film isn't suspenseful, but the director's distaste for the inner city's gun culture is clear to see. Superbly acted.\n",
        "Helping make these points is as strong a cast as Lee has yet worked with.\n",
        "Has the strengths of Spike Lee's best work without the preachiness and gimmicky camera moves of his weakest.\n",
        "Clockers thunders home with the bruising urgency of a story that needs to be told.\n",
        "A real, wicked thrill.\n",
        "Clockers uses unexpected narrative turns to accentuate the themes of lost innocence and uncultivated potential, and affirms that tragic melodrama is not a prerequisite for emotional impact.\n",
        "Lee captures the despair, self-delusion, occasional terror and frequent humor of a praised and popular novel, aided by the potent acting his direction virtually guarantees.\n",
        "What we get mostly in the film is a sense of Lee flailing, struggling to get a handle on his material.\n",
        "Although Clockers is, as I suggested, a murder mystery, in solving its murder, it doesn't even begin to find a solution to the system that led to the murder. That is the point.\n",
        "Feels as if the picture were edited to leave the action sequences in while removing any connecting material that might have helped them make sense.\n",
        "Dreadfully muddled, but mildly diverting.\n",
        "This glib, overheated film about vicious primates delivers little suspense...\n",
        "The entire tone of the book has been transformed from tension to tongue-in-cheek with dismal results.\n",
        "A movie that appears to have been designed first as a future theme park, and then as a major motion-picture.\n",
        "In every frame, it aspires to be a theme park.\n",
        "This is easily the worst filmed version of anything penned by the prolific author.\n",
        "As you stand there with your $7, ask yourself, 'Do I really want to see a rubber gorilla smoke a cigar?' If necessary, ask yourself twice.\n",
        "The least interesting adventure ever filmed.\n",
        "Marshall can't decide whether he's making a thriller or a laff-it-up lark.\n",
        "A splendid example of a genre no longer much in fashion, the jungle adventure story.\n",
        "It's the first bomb of another endless summer of commercial Hollywood crap.\n",
        "This is a boy's movie all the way.\n",
        "The screenplay may be credited to Michael Schiffer, but the punchy dialogue has Quentin Tarantino written all over it. The cast has a ball.\n",
        "Isn't there something awfully satisfying about the throbbing missiles and cathartic explosions that constitute this film's main excitement? Maybe so, but nothing else here delivers a comparable thrill.\n",
        "Crimson Tide has everything you could want from an action thriller and a few other things you usually can't hope to expect.\n",
        "Nope, this picture doesn't bear thinking about, but, if you resist that nasty temptation, setting all your mental gauges at Dead Slow, the flow of the action will see you through.\n",
        "If ever a picture crackled, Crimson Tide fits the description.\n",
        "Crimson Tide is pop-action naval gazing at its finest.\n",
        "This is the rare kind of war movie that not only thrills people while they're watching it, but invites them to leave the theater actually discussing the issues.\n",
        "Because of the contained environment, submarines make great settings for thrillers, with the throbbing of the engines sounding like a pulse. Crimson Tide is no exception -- the atmosphere alone is sufficient to keep the audience on edge.\n",
        "Crumb's sense of humor is his saving personal grace and the movie's insurance policy against total immersion into the morbid. But just so you know, Crumb fully earns its most revealing screen credit: 'David Lynch Presents.'\n",
        "Rodriguez's second feature may be a rambling, derivative exercise in gratuitous violence, but its determination to proceed as if the word 'restraint' never existed makes for gleeful entertainment.\n",
        "Mr. Rodriguez may be good enough to make a film about anything, but Desperado would collapse if its characters had to do anything but play with guns.\n",
        "What Rodriguez has essentially done in Desperado is make a slicker, more expensive copy of what came before. And what looked promising for $7,000 looks tiresome for a whole lot more.\n",
        "The routine gets tiresome for the Mariachi, and for the audience, too, after about an hour.\n",
        "Desperado is best when Rodriguez lets his playful side cut through the blare of a born filmmaker indulging his first chance at high-end Hollywood fireworks.\n",
        "On the whole, watching the film is about as much fun as sitting on a cactus.\n",
        "What happens looks terrific. Now if [Rodriguez] can harness that technical facility to a screenplay that's more story than setup, he might really have something.\n",
        "In this movie, words and actions speak equally loudly.\n",
        "Desperado, which is nothing but set pieces, snoozes between its scenes of carnage.\n",
        "Bloated and overlong.\n",
        "Entering the main flow of the story relatively late, Don Cheadle steals all his scenes as a live-wire, trigger-happy old buddy of Easy's from Texas, while Sizemore and Mel Winkler, as colorful underworld figures, make strong impressions.\n",
        "Sheer pleasure.\n",
        "The role of Easy looks as tailor-made for Mr. Washington as his suit, and it shows off the full effect of this actor's movie-star dazzle.\n",
        "A fluid, persuasive piece of movie-making graced with the considerable visual sophistication.\n",
        "The film also does a convincing job of re-creating Los Angeles of 1948 with both specificity and poetry.\n",
        "A bland, workaday detective flick.\n",
        "The movie simmers with pungent suspense, humor and eroticism.\n",
        "Franklin's picture is effortlessly wise beneath its entertaining surface.\n",
        "A hoary Chinatown knock-off wrapped in a seductively novel black-culture veneer, with a dash of Laura added for bad measure.\n",
        "First-rate American pulp -- fast, absorbing and substantive.\n",
        "While Devil in a Blue Dress never develops the taut momentum of Franklin's previous effort, One False Move, it maintains audience involvement.\n",
        "I liked the movie without quite being caught up in it: I liked the period, tone and look more than the story, which I never really cared much about.\n",
        "Degenerates into an improbable, confusing series of chases and an overly involved heist that takes far too long to set up.\n",
        "There's little wit or originality on offer, just the familiar escalation of car chases and big bangs.\n",
        "Pure action, with bigger and better explosions and stunts.\n",
        "It's a tense, terrifically funny action dazzler with a wow level in special effects that will be hard to top.\n",
        "The big set pieces don't build, really, they just pile up.\n",
        "Explosions aren't so funny anymore.\n",
        "Basically a wind-up action toy, cleverly made, and delivered with high energy. It delivers just what it advertises, with a vengeance.\n",
        "While parts one and two built momentum to an exhausting, exhilarating climax, part three has too many peaks and valleys (and, it seems, more of the latter than the former).\n",
        "An audience on the edge of its seat doesn't quibble about plot points.\n",
        "A triumph.\n",
        "Put to the sequel litmus test, queasily spectacular Vengeance would only rate a footnote without a strong original to exploit -- or a protracted telephone-terrorist subplot to steal from Dirty Harry 1.\n",
        "Striking to look at, though often offensively opportunistic, this mainly comes across as a throwaway shocker with energy to spare. There's not much thought in evidence though.\n",
        "A nihilistic comedy about a trio of alienated youngsters, pic is bold not only in its art design, but also in its narrative and tone, a mixture of satire and horror with heavy dosage of steamy sex and macabre violence.\n",
        "Inspired by Godard's classic Band Apart, Araki's fifth feature is his most audacious and most technically accomplished film to date, reflecting the larger than usual budget and gained experience.\n",
        "Imagine Natural Born Killers with a sense of humour.\n",
        "Sledgehammer direction, heavy irony and the easiest imaginable targets hardly show talent off to good advantage.\n",
        "It's a savagely funny ride fueled by Araki's insight and blunt compassion.\n",
        "Plays like a low-budget Natural Born Killers -- and that is not intended as a compliment.\n",
        "This is the kind of movie where the filmmaker hopes to shock you with sickening carnage and violent amorality, while at the same time holding himself carefully aloof from it with his style.\n",
        "Amy's a screaming, speed-addled banshee, and not the sort of chick you'd want to run into late at night (or spend 85 minutes with in a darkened theater).\n",
        "The violence becomes commonplace. The crudities never end. But there are hip benefits for staying to watch.\n",
        "An arty atrocity for thugs and sub-literates that makes Natural Born Killers look like The Sound of Music.\n",
        "More like Natural Born Killers than any other film that comes to mind, but it's ultimately sexier, funnier, and much more 'alternative' (in every sense of the word).\n",
        "Not every kid may be as mad and morose as Araki's lost boys... But a lot are, and in this fevered fantasy of Armageddon, he's got their number.\n",
        "You sense that there is so much more at stake here than meets the eye, an extraordinary anger about and fear of 90s purposelessness and predatory intolerance.\n",
        "Good luck searching for meaning -- you'll find mostly blood and epithets.\n",
        "Whenever Zucker stops piling on battle scenes as if he were directing Braveheart, his film casts a romantic spell.\n",
        "Aside from casting Richard Gere as Lancelot, First Knight marches out as an agreeably intelligent, mature and well-mounted telling of the legendary King Arthur story.\n",
        "The problem for him[Gere], and the film, comes when the non-physical acting begins.\n",
        "Pillaged of such mainstays as Merlin and Morgan le Fay-as well as magic, majesty and depth-'Camelot' has become 'Camelite.'\n",
        "Bad acting, dumb dialogue, and confusing cinematography abound, creating one of the most shoddy Camelot stories to date.\n",
        "...lots of action and chivalrous pomp, but no magic.\n",
        "[E]very era has the right--maybe even the duty--to reinvent the Arthurian legend according to its lights, and so there is something instructive and entertaining about this version.\n",
        "I've never seen a film -- whether it was based on a book, a play, or in this case a timeless legend -- treat its source material with such cavalier disregard.\n",
        "[I]f you tingle at the sound of metal unsheathing and the sight of flaming arrows whizzing through moonlight, you'll probably be swept away by this shining Knight in amour.\n",
        "The movie is entertaining enough in its own way, and Sean Connery makes a splendid King Arthur, but compared with the earlier films[Rob Roy and Braveheart] this one seems thin and unconvincing.\n",
        "There's swordplay to the hilt, but the story itself never quite gets in Gere.\n",
        "...a handsome, entertaining twist on the King Arthur legend...\n",
        "As with most unnecessary sequels, FW2 takes a similar plot -- reunited during a camping trip, Jesse saves Willy and vice versa -- and spreads it thinner, like watered-down tartar sauce.\n",
        "Hackers isn't a very good movie, but it's a darn sight more fun than The Net.\n",
        "After the mechanics of the thriller plot start to kick in, the film drags. And when it's time for the big cyber-showdown, we're stuck, once again, with footage of frantic typing.\n",
        "This is a movie that sums up the worst of the computer era: zapping you with techno-cliches and trapping you in constant visual crash and burn.\n",
        "The story is negligible, but it offers the same order of fun as a good rock video: the marriage of images and music.\n",
        "What's most grating about Hackers, however, is the guileless way the movie buys in to the computer-kid-as-elite-rebel mystique currently being peddled by magazines like Wired.\n",
        "Without being any sort of miracle, this engaging and lively exploitation fantasy-thriller about computer hackers, anarchistic in spirit, succeeds at just about everything The Net failed to.\n",
        "There is a great deal more style than substance here.\n",
        "The sappy ending's hard to take, but the on-line showdown between The Plague, the Secret Service and the united worldwide community of hackers is nail-biting.\n",
        "Though this scheme involves loads of important data, it manages to sound dopey all the same.\n",
        "It gives you more insight into the minds of Hollywood hacks than of computer hackers.\n",
        "How do you make typing look exciting?\n",
        "To its credit, Hackers recalls the pumped-up energy of Pump Up the Volume, as well as its casting prowess.\n",
        "Tirelessly modish, hyper-glossy, super-superficial. It's also cacophonous. And, for all of its drum-beating for brain power, dumb.\n",
        "The movie is well directed, written and acted, and while it is no doubt true that in real life no hacker could do what the characters in this movie do, it is no doubt equally true that what hackers can do would not make a very entertaining movie.\n",
        "What's uncovered beneath the flashy skin is an old-fashioned, film-by-numbers thriller.\n",
        "What it lacks in substance and plausibility it makes up in inventive imagery and deft shadings of a world of scheming cyberpunks.\n",
        "It's not a total bust, and some of the performances are charming, but it never matches the gleeful, irreverent mischief it had on stage.\n",
        "Rudnick, adapting his off-Broadway hit, deftly blends uproarious fun and touching gravity.\n",
        "Wildly uneven, and it aims at the lowest common denominator in its exceedingly broad comedy.\n",
        "While this may sound intriguing, the picture merely jumps around clumsily from incident to incident.\n",
        "If nothing else, Rudnick and director Christopher Ashley know how to keep the audience off balance and in stitches.\n",
        "It's more a series of sketches and momentary inspirations than a story that grows interesting.\n",
        "It is startling that such a funny play is not so funny a movie.\n",
        "You can have a better time title-scanning Johnny pics in an alphabetical video guide than you can enduring the latest Blade Runner knockoff: Johnny Mnemonic.\n",
        "The movie, by the end, practically seems intent on destroying itself.\n",
        "A thunderous, unoriginal futuristic hardware show for teenage boys.\n",
        "Directed without inspiration by Danny Cannon from a stupid script by Michael De Luca, William Wisher, and Steven de Souza.\n",
        "This slam-bang Stallone vehicle never quite delivers what its confident, fizzing visuals seem to promise.\n",
        "Although it is full of noise and fake firepower, Dredd simply lies there on the screen until the final scenes.\n",
        "Usually engaging and sympathetic, Stallone is blank and tongue-tied here, an immovable slab in the midst of 95 minutes of gunfire, explosions and Gothic excess.\n",
        "The director doesn't provide much kinetic movie-making pleasure but he knows enough to jam the screen with clamor. It's not excitement, exactly. It's simulated excitement.\n",
        "Sometimes, it's rather amusing, but it's impossible to decide whether this is accidental or on purpose.\n",
        "Stallone survives it, but his supporting cast, also including an uninvolved Joan Chen and a tremendously intense Jurgen Prochnow, isn't well used.\n",
        "Aside from the affable Schneider and the able Lane, the cast seems to be in deep shock. Um, make that Dredd lock.\n",
        "Never has such a big, dumb movie seemed so small, as it shrinks from Blade Runner sharp to Jetsonian junky.\n",
        "Frightening, frank and serious, a wake-up call to the world.\n",
        "None of the advance hype on Kids can prepare you for the raw, stripped-down reality that Larry Clark captures in his astonishing first film.\n",
        "Kids is the kind of movie that needs to be talked about afterward.\n",
        "Kids shows what transpires when children are set adrift in a heartless world, and warns us what happens -- and is already happening -- in the absence of love and guidance.\n",
        "Kids, a disturbingly voyeuristic look at adolescent promiscuity, is virtually child pornography disguised as a cautionary documentary.\n",
        "Ostensibly about the banality of youthful evil, Kids is simply about its own banality.\n",
        "A hip indie version of Truffaut's Day for Night, Living in Oblivion celebrates the very act of filmmaking as grand folly, a triumph of absurdist heroism.\n",
        "A treat.\n",
        "A very funny picture that presents the world of independent film making as a nightmare of conflicting egos, budgetary squalor and incompetence.\n",
        "\"Oblivion\" has a surrealistic, guilty-fun quality. It feels almost too good to be true.\n",
        "So you wanna make a movie? Well, first, you should see \"Living in Oblivion,\" Tom DiCillo's savagely funny satire of the world of independent filmmaking.\n",
        "Barker's visual side dominates its literary equivalent this time out, resulting in a time-killer that may amuse fans until illusion is shattered by the rolling of the end credits.\n",
        "Mallrats mixes clever bits and an appealing quirkiness (which goes a long way) with gross-out practical jokes, needless repetition and obvious padding, since it has no real plot.\n",
        "The movie has a few amusing '70s references and there's a wonderfully weird sequence featuring a topless fortune-teller. Overall, though, moviegoers can find much better deals.\n",
        "If the Sundance Institute or the AFI ever offers a course advising directors of successful first films what to avoid the second time around, Mallrats could be at the heart of the curriculum.\n",
        "The fatal flaw in plotting the material is that we don't care.\n",
        "Smith has slicked up his follow-up vision of Slackerville USA, but the outcome is nowhere near as brash and original.\n",
        "Between the routines and retorts, there's a lot of narrative dead air -- and far too many new guests.\n",
        "Despite a broad range of effective comedy and a decent laugh-per-minute ratio, Mallrats is likely to be a moderate disappointment for anyone who guffawed their way through the previous film.\n",
        "A disjointed but infectious series of comic vignettes, toilet humor, practical jokes, sight gags, even a sort of grunge variation on Keystone Kops slapstick.\n",
        "Noisy and meant for children only. A bored grown-up's only consolation is that the Rangers' popularity has probably peaked, and the next kiddie phenomenon must be on the way. Don't even think about what it will cost.\n",
        "Brings the popular TV series to the screen with a barrage of spectacular special effects, a slew of fantastic monsters, a ferociously funny villain -- and, most important, a refreshing lack of pretentiousness.\n",
        "The movie bolts along at a breakneck pace, from an opening sky diving scene to the climactic battle, which finds Ooze cackling away in the cockpit of a mechanical dinosaur.\n",
        "What depresses me inutterably is that children, who are fresh and inquisitive, will go to this movie and, for 88 minutes, the movie will do what it can to deaden their imaginations.\n",
        "Young fans of the six squeaky-clean super teens can look forward to an effects-loaded, energetic adventure that powers up martial-arts acrobatics as it cuts the cheesiness.\n",
        "These are the same performers who appear on the TV show, and you get the feeling this has become more than a meal ticket for them. Hokey dialogue is invested with an intensity that takes you out of the movie and into the psyches of the actors.\n",
        "The production values are much higher than those of the TV shows.\n",
        "Moonlight and Valentino is a Hallmark sympathy card of a film, pretty to look at with a message that's sincere. Yet it's hard to take its pretentious platitudes of grief and recovery too personally.\n",
        "Waller's witty, well-crafted yet unpretentious thriller--about American youths who make a movie in Moscow and get involved with the underworld--is a seductive piece of filmmaking that should keep viewers hyperventilating to the last reel.\n",
        "Though this slight but agreeable nail-biter loses a couple steps before its wrap-up, it's not before offering one of the funniest variations yet on the furious neighbor who wonders what's going on in the upstairs apartment.\n",
        "A thriller without thrills.\n",
        "Riddled with more coincidences and implausibilities than Hitchcock permitted himself in his entire career, The Net still gets by as a reasonably suspenseful, very au courant thriller.\n",
        "Pretty soon she's fleeing from her gun-wielding seducer, trying to recover an identity that's being systematically erased through alteration of her personal computer records, and dodging bullets on spinning carousels.\n",
        "The Net is never quite as sleek and chilling as it might have been, but it gives the old story of a wrongly accused innocent a nerve-wracking 90's twist.\n",
        "A strong enough suspense thriller, a high-tech version of one of those spiraling nightmares in which an innocent person is chased by assassins and wanted by the police.\n",
        "The story is standard issue pepped up with a sampling of smart computer talk to give the impression the characters know what they're talking about.\n",
        "Unfortunately, in movie theaters, as of now, there are no DELETE buttons.\n",
        "This stuff is so concocted I had no business caring about it. But I did, because of Bullock.\n",
        "Reminiscent of a slew of films, including The Pelican Brief and The Fugitive, The Net -- ploddingly directed by Irwin Winkler -- is frustratingly average in almost every other respect.\n",
        "Borrowing heavily from Alfred Hitchcock and John Grisham, director Irwin Winkler reduces a potentially-fascinating premise to the spearhead of a routine thriller.\n",
        "As an actress, Bullock has it all -- heart and soul, and mind, too.\n",
        "Writer/director Chris Columbus delivers his usual slapstick and sap shtick, but the sitcom-slick results fall flat.\n",
        "Mary is a spiritual descendant of Holly Golightly, and there's an echo, as well, of Edie Sedgwick, the late Andy Warhol superstar who moved the American-princess-on-a-bender mythology into the drug-rock era.\n",
        "Party Girl aspires to be cinematic champagne but comes out tasting more like sparkling cider.\n",
        "This exudes trendiness at regular intervals, and otherwise manages to be reasonably charming about Manhattan's melting pot culture, but my general response was still 'Wake me when it's over.'\n",
        "The screenplay, by Ms. Mayer and Harry Birckmayer, has its occasionally funny lines, but not nearly enough to certify the film as a hip urban comedy in tune with the cutting edge of downtown New York.\n",
        "If bad behaviour and smugness were truly charming, Party Girl might be as much fun as it imagines it is. And Madonna might even have a decent movie career.\n",
        "What makes it delicious fun is Posey, a party girl for the ages.\n",
        "Unlike most of the Hollywood Gen X movies, Party Girl actually looks as if it were made from the inside.\n",
        "If Party Girl weren't so contrived, and if Posey didn't exude such cold hauteur, all of that might have worked.\n",
        "The movie is poppy, clever and more than enjoyable, but Posey is something else altogether. She's a revelation.\n",
        "It's a showcase leading role for Parker Posey, who obviously has the stuff, and generates wacky charm. But the movie never pulls itself together.\n",
        "Though it doesn't exactly bowl you over with its ambitions, this teensy but breezy sleeper can at least be mentioned in a breath with two memorable predecessors it recalls ... Breakfast at Tiffany's.\n",
        "Hip and contemporary without being archly so.\n",
        "\"Freely adapted from the novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne,\" the credits say cautiously. I'll say.\n",
        "A very '90s take on a 1660s tale written in 1850, as a picture of early colonial life it's about as convincing as Pocahontas.\n",
        "Not only does the film bear little resemblance to the source novel, but it's cluttered with ridiculous symbolism.\n",
        "If you've read the book you won't know the ending. Let's just say that Indians with flaming arrows come to the rescue. They manage to keep a straight face, which is more than anyone in the audience will be able to do.\n",
        "This is a well-acted, beautiful movie.\n",
        "Though it's unclear what the audience would be for a faithful rendition of the Hawthorne novel, the question of who would ever want to see this one is murkier still.\n",
        "Literary purists will be aghast at some of the liberties taken with the original text, but my complaints have more to do with cinematic misjudgments than with those in the book-to-screen translation.\n",
        "The movie has removed the character's sense of guilt, and therefore the story's drama.\n",
        "Students beware: This is no sub for Cliffs Notes. The script takes more liberties with the text than Elizabeth Berkley did with that pole in Showgirls.\n",
        "The picture's period furnishings include Hester's 17th-century hot tub.\n",
        "Picture yourself trudging out of the theater with a letter \"D\" (for \"disappointment\") firmly pinned to your chest.\n",
        "Showgirls... is one of those delirious, hilarious botches that could be taught in film schools as a How Not To.\n",
        "Berkley's acting debut is a joy, if you can call it acting: she jumps up and down a lot to indicate excitement.\n",
        "One thing I'll say for Showgirls, it's educational. But sadly, it isn't much else.\n",
        "The script -- a generic blend mixing the soap of All About Eve with the suds of Valley of the Dolls -- is replete with the clunkiest dialogue this side of Peyton Place.\n",
        "A film of thunderous oafishness that gives adult subject matter the kind of bad name it does not need or deserve.\n",
        "To take Showgirls that seriously (as either trash-art or appalling pornography) wouldn't be worth the exertion.\n",
        "[The script] is as hoary as it is whore-y, whipping out every backstage cliche as he recycles his Flashdance plot into Trashdance.\n",
        "Think of Flashdance but with an unappealing leading lady playing a woman whose fierce ambition is to do something not admirable, just ridiculous.\n",
        "A waste of a perfectly good NC-17 rating.\n",
        "One of the worst films of the year.\n",
        "An overcoat movie for men who don't want to be seen going into a porno theater.\n",
        "With a cigar box of subplots, this episodic yarn is more numbing than boring, though its increasingly compelling narrative has the ill-timed misfortune to collapse completely in its final talky segment.\n",
        "Something to Talk About is at its best when Khouri's juicy script is adroitly mixing comedy and pathos.\n",
        "In [Khouri's] zeal to portray a world full of male scum, she creates a morally mismatched, pandering scenario.\n",
        "Everything about Something to Talk About feels off by a few beats.\n",
        "Something to Talk About never goes bad, though it does get corny in places, and it hits a couple of dull patches near the finish.\n",
        "Something to Talk About is the kind of movie where you start out wondering how all of these people are related, and end up knowing all too well.\n",
        "The ending is still pat, with lots of reasons for optimism, but Something is not as neatly -- or falsely -- resolved as most Hollywood films.\n",
        "Something to Talk About is weary -- every ounce of energy and originality has long since been wrung out of this formula, and the 'twist' of having the leads already married doesn't do much to spice up things.\n",
        "Ingeniously combines the schlocky fun of '50s sci-fi flicks with the shock tactics of Alien and the cautionary allure of Looking for Mr. Goodbar.\n",
        "Director Kathryn Bigelow comes closer than any other filmmaker to turning movies into a virtual reality trip.\n",
        "Once the premise has lost its promise, and Fiennes's brave attempts at characterization are sacrificed to pseudo-dazzle, everything appears awfully humdrum and, yes, distinctly dated.\n",
        "Undeniably thrilling and troubling.\n",
        "Though the creators of Strange Days may well be interested in its dramatic and thematic elements, they do not have the same touch for these moments as they do for camera pyrotechnics.\n",
        "Bigelow is so enamored of high-tech thrills, and so mesmerized by the violence she seeks to condemn, that her efforts at 11th-hour moralizing seem limp and halfhearted.\n",
        "It's big, explosive entertainment and, although not directed by Cameron, is very much in the vein we've come to expect from him.\n",
        "It's fascinating the way Bigelow is able to suggest so much of VR's impact (and dangers) within a movie - a form of VR that's a century old.\n",
        "It continues to charm and delight for the same reasons it did back in 1964.\n",
        "It is a small picture, a boutique musical. But it's lovely.\n",
        "As spun-sugar holiday treats go, \"Umbrellas\" is hard to resist.\n",
        "Seemingly banal and sentimental on the surface, [director Jacques] Demy has avoided these aspects by tasteful handling and the right balance in emotion, compassion and narrative.\n",
        "Umbrellas makes escapist play with the stuff of kitchen-sink social realism.\n",
        "Not only has he resurrected the quaint and artificial device of having the dialogue set to music and unrealistically sung, but he uses this operatic method to tell a story that is so banal... it wouldn't get beyond a reader in Hollywood.\n",
        "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg has stood the test of time as beautifully as Deneuve and seems likely to enchant future generations as fully as it has audiences over the past four decades.\n",
        "A choreography of the everyday timed to Demy's floating long takes and Michel Legrand's at turns jaunty and lachrymose score.\n",
        "Delicately bittersweet.\n",
        "A glorious romantic confection unlike any other in movie history.\n",
        "An operatic masterpiece of romanticism.\n",
        "Far more powerful than one would initially suppose.\n",
        "It's a glorious sight to behold -- though don't forget to listen as well.\n",
        "A surprisingly effective film, touching and knowing and, like Deneuve, ageless.\n",
        "One of the sleaziest movies of the year and certainly the most unpleasant.\n",
        "The script is draggy and overly obvious except for a mystifying mumbo-jumble of special effects.\n",
        "A politically correct comedy about drag queens? This is the American response to the superior Aussie flick Adventures of Priscilla. Macho Wesley Snipes, Patrick Swayze, and John Leguizamo can't lift it above the routine.\n",
        "Leguizamo's Chi Chi is the only one who looks anything like a drag queen, let alone a woman; yet we are asked to believe that it's Swayze's breathy Vida and Snipes' squealing Noxeema who've got their stocking seams straight.\n",
        "Kidron's direction stays flat even when the actors are funny. It doesn't help that the screenplay, by Douglas Carter Beane, is so thin that one of its biggest events is the three main characters' having car trouble.\n",
        "Imagine, \"Wong Foo\" suggests, a world where people stopped judging one another and simply surrendered to the silliness that's dormant inside us.\n",
        "Improbable as this all sounds, \"Wong Foo\" is a great deal of fun and a small step forward in Hollywood's depiction of homosexuals.\n",
        "Screenwriter Douglas Carter Beane pilfers not just plot elements from \"Priscilla,\" but also stirs in big chunks of \"Fried Green Tomatoes,\" \"Bagdad Cafe,\" \"Auntie Mame,\" \"The Music Man\" and \"Cinderella.\"\n",
        "What is amazing is how the movie manages to be funny and amusing while tippy-toeing around (a) sex, (b) controversy and (c) any originality in the plot.\n",
        "It's a glam-o-rama party until the trio hits the road. Suddenly, Wong Foo is all cross-dressed with no place to go -- but down.\n",
        "Slick and amiable and innocuous as hell, it's a foam-padded farce, as laboriously packaged as its three glam-sister ''heroines.''\n",
        "Though uncritical of NY designer Mizrahi, docu is everything that Altman's dreadful Ready to Wear should have been: An insider's view of the fashion world that's hip, light, authentic, revelatory, and always amusing.\n",
        "This movie has all the elements that Miramax's other fashion film, Robert Altman's disastrously received Ready to Wear, didn't, including intrigue, humor, irony, pathos and real live supermodels.\n",
        "It's a genuine vault at greatness that misses the mark -- but survives.\n",
        "A moderately successful guy's movie with both weak and strong elements where lots of things are brilliantly blown up and few things make any kind of sense.\n",
        "Waterworld isn't Fishtar, but Kevin Costner's pricey, post-apocalyptic sloshbuckler isn't a seafaring classic either.\n",
        "In the tradition of the old Westerns and Mel Gibson's Road Warrior flicks, this film provides good escapist fun.\n",
        "It's one of those marginal pictures you're not unhappy to have seen, but can't quite recommend.\n",
        "Has the makings of a cult movie.\n",
        "If the story seems a little waterlogged, it's still big, loud, and fun to watch.\n",
        "Were it not for John Travolta's big-hearted portrayal of an unemployed white factory worker driven to commit a desperate act, the movie would be an emotionally frozen exercise in cautious high-mindedness.\n",
        "White Man's Burden spirals into tragedy but never into stirring drama. It stays stuck at the level of noble experiment.\n",
        "Watching this movie is like watching Godfrey Cambridge's racial switcheroo in 1970's Watermelon Man -- without the laughs.\n",
        "A ham-fisted, under-imagined dialectic on race relations.\n",
        "It's undeniably fascinating to watch this hypothetical experiment for a while. But White Man's Burden starts to feel like an only-passable Twilight Zone episode stretched into a full-length movie.\n",
        "There isn't much of a story in White Man's Burden.\n",
        "White Man's Burden was worth doing once, if it only to find out it isn't worth doing again.\n",
        "No one looking for an action movie is going to choose this one. Equally obviously, no one interested in a film about racial stereotyping in America wants to sit through chase scenes.\n",
        "The role of the retiring master is not an easy one, but a prize in the right hands. Michael Redgrave fills it with distinction.\n",
        "Worth watching for Redgrave's powerfully detailed performance as the schoolmaster.\n",
        "What begins as an anti-Goodbye, Mr. Chips ends, thanks to some psychological point stretching, as an imitation of it.\n",
        "The schoolmaster to whom our pity is drawn is a pretty weak and lukewarm individual, hardly fit to be a teacher of growing boys -- even a teacher of classical languages, which he is.\n",
        "Bushwhacked isn't much of a movie. But it made me laugh more than I'd like to admit.\n",
        "Riddled with noble sentiments and good intentions, this great-outdoors hijinx is hiking familiar trails with a combination of bathroom humor, cute kids and a fuzzy, happy ending.\n",
        "A little bit of Daniel Stern's mugging, dimwit style of comedy goes a long way.\n",
        "[A] strained, way, way over-the-top comedy-thriller in which its star, Daniel Stern, as the film's executive producer, gives himself free rein to mug and show off to increasingly numbing and tedious effect.\n",
        "With a little effort from viewers, Daniel Stern's dumb comedy, Bushwhacked, might bring on a smile. But don't expect anything so grand as a chuckle.\n",
        "This is an occasion when it's far better to see the trailer and skip the actual film. Once the opening credits start rolling, it's all downhill.\n",
        "A bush-league kiddie comedy in The Mighty Ducks mode.\n",
        "Burnt by the Sun was not the best of the nominated foreign films (Before the Rain deserved to win), and is not even very original.\n",
        "Though my foreign Oscar pick would still have been Eat Drink Man Woman, Sun is such a personal close second that I can go with the academy novelty of novelties.\n",
        "Those unfamiliar with Sandler's antics may...begin to find him annoying sometime between the appearance of the Universal logo and the end of the opening credits.\n",
        "If you've ever had a yen to relive the third grade, this must be the next best thing.\n",
        "Director Tamra Davis and screenwriters Sandler and Tim Herlihy scatter the bad jokes like fertilizer. Nothing sprouts.\n",
        "As one character tells Billy in the finale: \"Everyone in this room is dumber for having listened to you.\"\n",
        "The three women are so spirited and funny -- so emotionally keyed into all the hearts and flowers -- that they give the movie their own kind of truth.\n",
        "The entire film feels like the result of a market study.\n",
        "Roos and Ross (and I promise never to put those names together again) are so busy jerking the audience from wacky to teary, and back again, they seem blithely unaware of the howling melodrama of it all.\n",
        "An engagingly acted, likable, fried green Thelma & Louise.\n",
        "It's decent mass consumption entertainment, but there's not much in the way of meat.\n",
        "It's an original, and what it does best is show how strangers can become friends, and friends can become like family.\n",
        "Goldberg and Parker are extraordinary.\n",
        "Practically screams 'TV movie.'\n",
        "Three female friends grow up in a small town in Ireland in the mid-50s and attend college in Dublin in this nostalgic soap opera that's vaguely evocative of Peyton Place, though generally less memorable.\n",
        "Old-fashioned and nostalgic, Pat O'Connor's nicely directed tale of friendship between three Irish girls features a strong central performance from Minnie Driver that promises a bright future in Hollywood pictures.\n",
        "The fizzing dialogue gets all the little details right, but the plot's nothing new, and the lingering shots of hibernian greenery aim straight for mid-Atlantic bland-out.\n",
        "Beyond eliciting warm, animated performances from his actors (with a cast that also includes Alan Cumming as a hair-raising suitor of Benny's), Mr. O'Connor gives Circle of Friends an enveloping look and sound.\n",
        "Driver's tough core of honesty and wit is bewitching. So's the movie.\n",
        "Young Benny has a nice smile, and she and Jack seem like pleasant people, but in the end (and in the beginning and in the middle) it's hard to get worked up about them.\n",
        "It's not a challenging movie or an original one, but it does have its pleasures -- most notably a radiant, soulful debut performance from Driver.\n",
        "Driver is impulsively sweet, touching and hilarious as she copes with her new, romantic life.\n",
        "Heartwarming and poignant, a love story that glows with intelligence and feeling.\n",
        "A lot of films, especially love stories, seek a level of comfort through predictability, but this one goes too far.\n",
        "Like an old-fashioned theater program, it tells you early on who and what each of its characters is -- and so they prove to be, enjoyably.\n",
        "Polanski certainly gets the maximum voltage and precision out of his story and actors, keeping us preternaturally alert to shifting power relationships and delayed revelations.\n",
        "Kingsley shrewdly tantalizes the viewer about his identity, and gets to deliver the text's most riveting monologue at the end. The lesser-known Wilson may be the first among equals, impressing strongly as the equivocating husband.\n",
        "Polanski wisely never opens out the action from the remote clifftop house. In keeping things claustrophobic, close-up and ambivalent, he heightens the suspense (not to mention the sexual tension).\n",
        "Mr. Polanski treads lightly on the clumsier lines, and sustains tension by creating an elegant, unobtrusive dance with the camera.\n",
        "Death and the Maiden forces the audience to confront questions about torture and punishment.\n",
        "Polanski keeps the situation ambiguous to provoke questions of guilt and responsibility.\n",
        "Any degree of tension cultivated by Polanski is frequently undermined by Rafael Yglesias and Ariel Dorfman's sputtering script.\n",
        "Richer than its materials might promise.\n",
        "The Polanski touch -- apart from a little suspense here and there -- is limited.\n",
        "The fundamental strength of Weaver's personality doesn't work here. Nor does her particular style of rage and sorrow.\n",
        "Dumb and Dumber, which features Carrey and Jeff Daniels as nitwits traveling cross-country, is a frayed string of gags posing as a movie. Carrey, though, does literal-minded doofdom with peerless enthusiasm.\n",
        "The wholeheartedness of this descent into crude and rude humor is so good-natured and precise that it's hard not to partake in the guilty pleasures of the exercise.\n",
        "This is a long way from the social comedy of Jerry Lewis. The characters here are ultimately turned into punching bags or punch-line dispensers.\n",
        "Given American cinema's current obsession with innocence and ignorance, at least this never romanticises its protagonists. They are genuinely, irredeemably, 100 per cent no-hopers.\n",
        "A movie that fully lives up to its name, right down to an opening credit sequence rife with intentional misspellings and grammatical errors.\n",
        "An uneven collection of bodily function jokes, facial gyrations, sexual jibes and pedestrian slapstick.\n",
        "An execrable catalogue of doody jokes, Dumb and Dumber is an abominable, abdominal comedy.\n",
        "Inspired, irreverent, spark-driven comedy that takes you places you never thought a movie would go -- even a Jim Carrey movie.\n",
        "Carrey, I am now convinced, is a true original. In The Mask, he had the screenplay and production to back him up. Here, the filmmaking is more uncertain.\n",
        "While I won't claim to have gone through this entire film without laughing, there are some long periods between chuckles.\n",
        "Lee's Eat Drink Man Woman is tender without being mushy, sweet without being syrupy -- and surprising in ways that can only make you smile.\n",
        "But by the end, I felt that Lee had, so to speak, stuck a little too closely to the recipe: His movie is moderately enjoyable in a been-there, done-that sort of way.\n",
        "Eat Drink Man Woman may not just amuse and entertain you. It's likely to make you very hungry, too-perhaps for more than food.\n",
        "That guarantee of good taste is, finally, a bit of a downer; there are plenty of surprises, but no hint of risk.\n",
        "Mildly charming.\n",
        "Ambitious and entertaining.\n",
        "The food metaphor never carries weight, and the characterisations are too shallow to lend the film emotional punch.\n",
        "Wonderfully seductive, and nicely knowing about all of its characters' appetites.\n",
        "The movie's main appeal -- beyond stomach yearnings caused by its cuisine -- comes from the actors, who infuse their archetypal roles with comedic appeal.\n",
        "Eat Drink Man Woman is a delicacy but also something more -- something like food for the heart.\n",
        "Who said foreign films can't be fun?\n",
        "A spicy, well-written comedy about family, food and independence.\n",
        "The personalities in this well-drawn family combine to produce subtle new flavors -- and in the end, no one is spiced as you'd imagined they'd be.\n",
        "Beguiling rather than thrilling, oddly charming instead of transporting, meaning that Disney will have its work cut out for it with what is at heart a cult movie and a film buff's dream.\n",
        "It certainly succeeds as a funny, touching tribute to tenacity, energy, ambition and friendship.\n",
        "Mr. Depp isn't best known as a comic actor, but he gives a witty and captivating performance, bringing wonderful buoyancy to this crazy role.\n",
        "Outrageously disjointed and just as outrageously entertaining, the picture stands as a successful outsider's tribute to a failed kindred spirit.\n",
        "In his finest, funniest, most poignant film to date, Tim Burton plays cinematic alchemist, turning drive-in schlock into movie gold.\n",
        "This Ed Wood is dead wood.\n",
        "[An] oddly affectionate bio-pic.\n",
        "An entertaining, oddly affectionate look at the cross-dressing grade-Z moviemaker.\n",
        "The movie's black and white photography convincingly recaptures the look and feel of 1950s sleaze, including some of the least convincing special effects in movie history.\n",
        "Given the finished film, one also has to wonder if Ed Wood was interesting enough to base a two- hour movie on.\n",
        "Making a movie about the life of Ed Wood certainly qualifies as an impossible dream, but Burton has pulled it off with wit, imagination and something amazingly close to grace.\n",
        "Burton has evoked the surface of Ed Wood's life, but in a story about a man who loves angora and frilly panties, he has barely unbuttoned Wood's uniform.\n",
        "The delicate air of romance that often makes this sort of film worthwhile is absent.\n",
        "Like the relationship it depicts, everything goes terribly slack in the middle.\n",
        "Mr. Crystal's style as a director is smoothe and bland.\n",
        "Since the stories are none too startling, it's hard to see why these otherwise bright people should be so enthusiastic about boring themselves.\n",
        "With its uneven tone, Forget Paris doesn't have enough comedy or heartfelt romance to eclipse its faults.\n",
        "It all works.\n",
        "This movie has such a naked desire to evoke the human condition, you want to throw a blanket over it.\n",
        "Shamelessly schmaltzy.\n",
        "In the marriage-go-round Forget Paris, Debra Winger falls for Billy Crystal because he makes her laugh. Likewise, you will forgive Forget its faults because it will make you chuckle. Hard. And often.\n",
        "Insipid songs and not much story.\n",
        "An incoherent mess that jumps from one unlikely, brainless, crash-bang situation to another.\n",
        "This strange family fare, about a dog that was once a man, tries unsuccessfully to combine the expected magic of animal adventures with some more serious ideas.\n",
        "As if banal platitudes about work-vs. -family aren't insufferable enough, there's a kicker gag involving Jackson that'll even have Mister Rogers begging for Pulp Fiction II.\n",
        "Artistry abounds in every aspect of the film.\n",
        "There's something too artificial and highfalutin about the movie.\n",
        "A fascinating, if occasionally overly melodramatic, recreation of a period when Baroque music ruled Europe.\n",
        "Because Carlo Broschi, the 18th-century castrato singer known as Farinelli, was himself such an exotic and sensationalistic figure, you'd think that creating a dull movie out of his flamboyant life would be next to impossible. Think again.\n",
        "Glossy and histrionic, salacious and empty, Farinelli reduces a fascinating story to a series of hissy fits and leering glances.\n",
        "Farinelli, one of the 1995 Oscar nominees in the foreign film category, is onto an interesting story, all right, but it leaves us feeling, like some of Farinelli's lovers, that something is missing.\n",
        "The expensive new version of Flash Gordon is a lot more gaudy, and just as dumb, as the original series starring Buster Crabbe.\n",
        "A respectable time-waster.\n",
        "The narrative is a little plodding, but adult punters will soon slip back into areverie for the lost visions of Saturday morning cinema.\n",
        "Is it fun? Yeah, sort of, it is.\n",
        "Ambition is something to respect in an artist, but Charles Burnett's police-corruption drama The Glass Shield is such a maladroit piece of filmmaking that its weighty themes and sclerotic tangle of a plot end up making it a trial to sit through.\n",
        "A powerful moral drama that tries to deal with the racism at the root of many problems in contempo American society.\n",
        "The movie feels sketchy, as if Burnett chopped the flesh off his screenplay and left us only the bare bones.\n",
        "It's a rigorous, angry piece of work, but it misses out on the psychological depths that have made Burnett's previous films among the glories of recent American independent moviemaking.\n",
        "An implausible, wearisome clunker trying to ring true but making only dull thuds.\n",
        "Burnett's screenplay has a tendency to be a little too preachy, especially during the unsatisfying final scene. There's a fine line between getting the message across through subtlety and becoming didactic...\n",
        "It has both ideas and a point of view. But the ideas are far from new, and the point of view is blatantly knee-jerk.\n",
        "Though no masterpiece, the film is an interesting sidebar for moviegoers who try to keep up; it's like a '50s film noir oddity you catch on 3 a.m. TV, only to find that it's become a more scintillating view than Ben-Hur.\n",
        "It's about three hours long. But it moves like Isiah, fast and smooth, and it's over in a heartbreak.\n",
        "Hoop Dreams has shown us that the rules of the game are stacked against kids like Gates and Agee. Even better, it shows us how they fight back, with the inside moves of hope.\n",
        "A heady dose of the American dream and the American nightmare combined -- a numbing investigation of how one point on an exam or one basket or turnover in a game can make all the difference in a family's fortunes.\n",
        "A prodigious achievement that conveys the fabric of modern American life, aspirations and incidentally, sports, in close-up and at length, Hoop Dreams is a documentary slam dunk.\n",
        "Unforgettable.\n",
        "An ironic drama so beautifully sculpted it could be transposed without alteration into a fictional film.\n",
        "The film's great achievement is to reveal the relentless way in which coaches and recruiters refuse to see Arthur and William as anything other than social cliches.\n",
        "Along the way it becomes a revealing and heartbreaking story about life in America.\n",
        "The most powerful movie about sports ever made.\n",
        "An extraordinarily affecting documentary.\n",
        "This picture has a legitimate dramatic structure that is equally as compelling as a scripted slice of fiction.\n",
        "A documentary that breathes new life into the subject by showing the everyday reality of that dream.\n",
        "Lynskey and Winslet are extraordinary actresses.\n",
        "Combines original vision, a drop-dead command of the medium and a successful marriage between a dazzling, kinetic techno-show and a complex, credible portrait of the out-of-control relationship between the crime's two schoolgirl perpetrators.\n",
        "Unlike the campy excess of Jackson's earlier Dead Alive, deliberate overkill ltimately points toward a dearth of ideas rather than a surfeit.\n",
        "Acted with conviction, and directed and written with febrile vibrancy.\n",
        "Stylish and eerily compelling before it overplays its campy excesses, Heavenly Creatures does have a feverish intensity to recommend it.\n",
        "1994 spellbinder.\n",
        "Revealed in unforgettable fashion by a capable director, the events that unfold in this film are not easily forgotten.\n",
        "Jackson (who wrote the script with Frances Walsh) evokes the girlsa(TM) fantasy world with scenes featuring plasticene figures, creating an eerie, metaphysical dimension to the movie.\n",
        "Powerful, evocative movie.\n",
        "An unforgettable experience.\n",
        "What makes Jackson's film enthralling and frightening is the way it shows these two unhappy girls, creating an alternative world so safe and attractive they thought it was worth killing for.\n",
        "Turns out to be an inane fish-out-of-water comedy. Along the way it turns into a virtual McDonald's commercial, too. The fact that you can hardly tell the difference is a good clue to the movie's bad-television flavor.\n",
        "As good-natured as its big, beefy star, comedian Sinbad.\n",
        "In its worst moments, Houseguest becomes a struggle in which a very human comedian fights to project his personality over the director's technological muddle. But the good news is that Sinbad wins.\n",
        "Plot-wise, there's little here beyond a few insubstantial strands.\n",
        "It's about seduction, and either you succumb to its inky entrapments or you resist. When its mojo was working, I was happy to be had.\n",
        "Why would Tom Cruise be playing Lestat, a gaunt, suave European vampire with a taste for young men? Because a big movie star can do whatever he wants.\n",
        "The leading performances, if acceptable, are not everything they needed to be to fully flesh out these elegant immortals.\n",
        "The major problem lies with Rice's own script, which is dramatically repetitive and philosophically banal.\n",
        "Interview with the Vampire promises a constantly surprising vampire story, and it keeps that promise.\n",
        "For all its visionary brilliance, the movie version of Interview never lets us close enough to see ourselves in Louis. We're dazzled but unmoved.\n",
        "When Interview with the Vampire works, it's as compelling and engrossing a piece of entertainment as is available on film today. When it falters, the weaknesses seem magnified.\n",
        "My complaint about the film is that not very much happens, in the plot sense.\n",
        "Passionately anticipated and much ballyhooed, the film, alas, is little more than a foppish, fang de siecle costume drama. Its pulse barely registers.\n",
        "The movie's energy starts to drain like blood from a vampire's victim. You'll feel that ebb, sooner or later, as you begin to glance regularly at your watch.\n",
        "A happy, healthy, bouncing baby of a movie.\n",
        "The plot is a more fertile ground for comedy than the 'sperm milkshake' that made Schwarzenegger and Danny De Vito brothers in Reitman's Twins.\n",
        "Junior demands more range from its leading man than he's capable of giving. The predictable result is a big-budget mess more likely to elicit groans than laughter.\n",
        "A fleecy romantic caper with a dusting of feminism, the picture is basically a one-joke movie successfully nursed by director Ivan Reitman.\n",
        "For the right audience, Junior may deliver. But there's a whole lot of pregnancy to go through first.\n",
        "It's goofy and ridiculous and preposterous, and yet it makes you feel good, and there is something oddly heartwarming about the sight of this macho guy melting with feelings of protectiveness and maternal concern.\n",
        "As a comedy, Junior has its share of laughs -- but no more than its share.\n",
        "In Connery it has a hero who is inescapably appealing.\n",
        "Despite its merits, the script fails to escape the silly season that fouls up so many thrillers, that time when the twists merely seem like the narrative equivalents of those violin shrieks on a cheesy score.\n",
        "It doesn't bog down in the bogs, but it's slow-moving just about everyplace else.\n",
        "There is no psychological depth, no real motivation, no human values to weigh, just characters jerked here and there like puppets in an arbitrary plot.\n",
        "The longer you stay with it, the more routine and uninspired it seems -- not to mention cowardly.\n",
        "It's brutal, horribly manipulative, and we've seen this stuff before in better pictures.\n",
        "Despite its tendency to tread well-traveled roads, Just Cause is filmed with enough energy and craft that, for the majority of its one-hundred minute running time, it's reasonably entertaining.\n",
        "Sitting through it, I found myself shuddering at what Disney may have in store for next summer.\n",
        "It is numbingly bland, homogenized and deflated by an utter lack of original wit or charm. Worst of all, it is subtly but conspicuously condescending to its target audience.\n",
        "It's a missed opportunity for introducing the Mortal Kombat generation to medieval combat that was really mortal.\n",
        "The ragtag adaptation by Michael Part and Robert Levy is familiar fodder run through a blender too high and too fast.\n",
        "Sluggish and low-energy.\n",
        "This lively time-travel fantasy is the clear result of imagination and reflection on the part of writers Michael Part and Robert L. Levy and director Michael Gottlieb and their colleagues, who possess a crucial light touch.\n",
        "There's nothing particularly wrong with A Kid in King Arthur's Court and nothing right with it, either.\n",
        "Because of the square, lackluster way that director Michael Gottleib has staged his material, the whole production seems sort of limp and perfunctory.\n",
        "What's most effective about the new Kiss of Death is Tucci's marvelously slimy prosecutor.\n",
        "A crackling thriller that feels unusually attuned to its lowlife characters.\n",
        "Cage and Caruso strike sparks in this riveting piece of pulp fiction, but it's that first Kiss you'll remember.\n",
        "It's a sleek, muscular thriller played by a terrific ensemble cast...\n",
        "A riveting crime drama.\n",
        "Cage, one of the few American actors who gets more interesting from film to film, comes close to kidnaping the picture as Little Junior, a pumped-up but asthmatic thug who, like King Kong, is a gorilla with a wistful air about him.\n",
        "It shouldn't be disjointed and uncompelling, but it is.\n",
        "Caruso's acting is vivid, but amazingly quiet and internal, and it's fascinating to watch the kaleidoscopically conflicted emotions battle beneath his controlled surface.\n",
        "Cage dominates the camera, stealing scenes by the sheer intensity of his inimitable strangeness.\n",
        "The picture is watchable, but nothing about it will linger, except perhaps the feeling that, with a more polished script, it might have been significantly better.\n",
        "If you savor movies about sleazy plea bargains and other lawyer hardballing, Death has its moments. Otherwise the latest from director Barbet Schroeder is only a movie of moments.\n",
        "What places it a sizable cut about the routine is its spectacular visual effects, the best since Stanley Kubrick's 2001.\n",
        "There's no breather in the picture, no lyricism; the only attempt at beauty is in the double sunset.\n",
        "George Lucas, who made American Graffiti, has put together a sci-fi film that draws on any number of associations. Star Wars is both amazing and familiar.\n",
        "A grand and glorious film that may well be the smash hit of 1977, and certainly is the best movie of the year so far.\n",
        "A magnificent film. George Lucas set out to make the biggest possible adventure fantasy out of his memories of serials and older action epics, and he succeeded brilliantly.\n",
        "Has distinct limitations, but the current return to a cinema of spectacle and wonder is wholly encouraging.\n",
        "It is, all in all, hard to think of a place or an age group that would not respond to the enthusiastic inventiveness with which Lucas has enshrined his early loves.\n",
        "Lucas fills his screen with loving touches.\n",
        "Compelling backstory, exciting action and pleasantly archetypal characters.\n",
        "A dynamic entertainment, efficiently and exuberantly setting up its mythic tale of heroes and villains, rebels and rogues, princesses and monsters, good and evil.\n",
        "A pop-culture landmark!\n",
        "A grandiose and violent epic with a simple and whimsical heart.\n",
        "Like some indefatigable King of the Hill, it stands alone and triumphant, regardless of the many imitators that assail its position.\n",
        "It's fun and funny.\n",
        "Twenty years later, George Lucas' loved saga of the war between good and evil in a distant galaxy returns in digitally enhanced and augmented form.\n",
        "His work here seems less inventive than in THX 1138.\n",
        "Darth Vader and his James Earl Jones voice is a bad egg no matter how much we know about his screwy upbringing.\n",
        "Backgrounds in some sequences are now more populated than they were, and it's fun to see all the creatures that make up the \"wretched hive of scum and villainy\" that Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan Kenobi describes.\n",
        "None of these characters has any depth, and they're all treated like the fanciful props and settings!\n",
        "George Lucas has made the kind of sci-fi adventure movie you dream about finding!\n",
        "The film uses studio resources to create an entrancing world both in New York and in the heroine's fantasies about India.\n",
        "An astonishing work of studio artifice, A Little Princess is that rarest of creations, a children's film that plays equally well to kids and adults.\n",
        "An exemplary version of Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel.\n",
        "A bright, beautiful and enchantingly childlike vision.\n",
        "Cuaron's version of magic realism consists of seeing incredibly fanciful sets and situations in precise detail.\n",
        "The 1939 Shirley Temple version of this book came closer to capturing Sara's vitality.\n",
        "It's not only suitable for consumption by those over age 10, it's actually enjoyable.\n",
        "A Little Princess exquisitely re-creates the ephemeral world of childhood, an enchanted kingdom where everything, even make-believe, seems possible.\n",
        "There are moments in A Little Princess when you may just want to clap from pleasure.\n",
        "The material is emotionally wrenching, but the actors play sociopolitical totems more than flesh-and-blood characters.\n",
        "This is an absorbing and involving picture, but the terms propounded here limit the story, which depends almost entirely on emotions rather than on thought.\n",
        "This drama about interracial adoption is serious and affecting, thanks in large part to the presence of its two magnetic stars.\n",
        "Losing Isaiah transcends the custody issue and finds drama in the black-white polarities that neither character can escape.\n",
        "Not only does this lowest-common denominator conclusion backfire, it insults anyone who invested their time getting involved in the whole thing.\n",
        "While the subject may be controversial enough to merit an Oprah free-for-all, this evenhanded melodrama is neutral to a fault.\n",
        "The movie, directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal and written by Naomi Foner, deals with all of those issues, but in a finally unsatisfactory way.\n",
        "Thought-provoking and dramatically-solid.\n",
        "Hytner's version of Bennett's comic-tragic drama of the tormented king who almost lost his mind confirms that power games, family scandals, and personal intrigues have always been integral to the British Crown, an institution both revered and reviled.\n",
        "In its own shambling, elliptical way it's an entertaining, memorable movie whose 2 1/2 hours go by without strain.\n",
        "Hawthorne is by turn outrageous and pathetic and imperious and poignant and very funny.\n",
        "The thrill of Hawthorne's astounding performance is not something you want to miss.\n",
        "For those who, like myself, were disappointed in the play, the film contains pleasant surprises, all of them resulting from differences between the two arts.\n",
        "Without exception, the acting is top-notch.\n",
        "Somehow ... this frail figure [George] is an immensely likable -- and, at times, deeply moving -- character.\n",
        "The battle of wills between these two strong men [George and Willis] is the centerpiece of the movie, and hugely entertaining.\n",
        "[Hawthorne] turns what would surely be an unsympathetic role in lesser hands into something poetic -- and hysterical.\n",
        "[Whale] did it in the Grand Guignol manner, with as many queer sounds, dark corners, false faces and cellar stairs as could possibly be inserted.\n",
        "Maximum of stimulating shock is there, but the thing is handled with subtle change of pace and shift of tempo that keeps attention absorbed to a high voltage climax.\n",
        "One of the most deservedly famous and chilling horror films of all time.\n",
        "The film is unique in Whale's work in that the horror is played absolutely straight, and it has a weird fairytale beauty not matched until Cocteau made La Belle et la Bete.\n",
        "A stirring grand-guignol type of picture, one that aroused so much excitement at the Mayfair yesterday that many in the audience laughed to cover their true feelings.\n",
        "As much as the later movies diluted the character of the Frankenstein creature, nothing could blunt the impact made by Karloff in the role of the most memorable movie monster of all time.\n",
        "The image that best sums up this dismal comedy is Cedric the Entertainer cringing over a cell phone that's been hidden in a cow's rectum.\n",
        "This makes an even worse job of its premise than you might expect, leaving it to the usual sidekick, Cedric the Entertainer, to provide the occasional laugh as a convict-turned-holy man.\n",
        "Dull comedy.\n",
        "None of the girls are demonstrably embarrassed to be in the film, which speaks to either their work ethic or their poor taste.\n",
        "I venture that this is not what we really want from Tommy Lee Jones.\n",
        "It's got a lot of small movies bouncing around inside it, but there's no big movie on the outside.\n",
        "Though there isn't much to recommend Man of the House, there's really no reason to warn people off of it, either.\n",
        "Mindless, vapid fare.\n",
        "Straight-to- video-quality mess.\n",
        "Herek keeps things moving and throws in some lively action sequences but keeps the emphasis on the amusing and affectionate relationships between Jones and the girls.\n",
        "Though predictability runs all through this House, it works up a modest charm thanks to the emergence of likable, individualized characters.\n",
        "A high concept that goes nowhere.\n",
        "90 minutes with a few routine chase sequences but without a single laugh represents a poor way to spend a looooooong evening.\n",
        "The movie is awesome only in its predictability.\n",
        "Sharp instructs the girls on the evils of term-paper plagiarism and the importance of dressing to cover their navels.\n",
        "It's not a perfect film, by far, but Jones' playful banter with his cheerleading charges remains light and just this side of predictable.\n",
        "Sitcom-style trifle proves more than passably amusing.\n",
        "Despite having a comeptent director, it's a slap-dash thing, with Cedric not really fitting into the main story.\n",
        "Director/co-scripter Nora Ephron pitches the humor at a cacophonous level and displays the comedic equivalent of two left feet in evolving an absurdist, slapstick yarn.\n",
        "Ephron's timing and sensitivity have deserted her, leaving behind only the sentimentality.\n",
        "A title song incorporating the names of nut varieties is only one of the film's desperate ploys.\n",
        "Gag.\n",
        "Is there anything more excruciating than failed farce?\n",
        "Every character shines with such dazzling intensity and such inexhaustible comic invention that the movie becomes tiresome, like too many clowns.\n",
        "Only the least demanding audiences can be expected to buy into Milk Money.\n",
        "This pleasant, unassuming little comedy manages to overcome its many potential shortcomings.\n",
        "It's pointless to blame the cast members, who at least are in there trying.\n",
        "An embarrassing, preposterous mess.\n",
        "[A] jaded attempt at warmhearted comedy.\n",
        "John Mattson's script is every bit as silly as it sounds; it dawdles, stumbles, stalls, embarrasses both itself and the audience, and is routinely formulaic to boot.\n",
        "With a tip of the hat to the performers, this is a misguided comedy with Hall of Shame pedigree. Its commercial prospects are quick, down and dirty.\n",
        "This feelgood romantic comedy is short on laughs, sexual chemistry, and the thriller subplot won't produce any white knuckles.\n",
        "Richard Benjamin, laboring under the idea that this is an enchanting premise, directs such episodes as if he were Norman Rockwell in a trenchcoat.\n",
        "Some movies just don't know when enough is enough.\n",
        "A preposterous movie about a boy, a babe and a car, all of them functioning minimally in what is essentially a showcase for Melanie Griffith's body.\n",
        "Question: Will Hollywood ever retire the Hooker With a Heart of Gold?\n",
        "I don't want to spoil it for you, but let's just say the gangster doesn't get what he wants, and true love saves the day.\n",
        "Smuttiness is made coy; innocence is made dirty; boyhood sexuality is made into a cartoon.\n",
        "A Christmas season evergreen.\n",
        "The original (and best) version of the cockle-warming tale of a man who claims to be the real-life Santa Claus.\n",
        "A surefire, brightly cynical bit of whimsy.\n",
        "Miracle on 34th Street isn't great art or high comedy, but it is good entertainment.\n",
        "So you don't believe in Santa Claus? If you want to stay a non-believer don't see Miracle.\n",
        "It's a highly professional piece of Hollywood sentimentalism.\n",
        "[Let us] heartily proclaim that it is the freshest little picture in a long time, and maybe even the best comedy of this year.\n",
        "The figures are right, the investment looks good, but the emotional pay-off is minimal.\n",
        "More than likely you will forgive the compromises -- the story of Henri Young needed to be told.\n",
        "Woefully over-manipulative and over-the-top.\n",
        "A reasonably exhilarating hybrid of prison movie and courtroom drama.\n",
        "Regardless of how this version raises the hackles of Alcatraz aficionados, Marc Rocco's movie is a solid and affecting example of film making.\n",
        "Though based on a true story, this grueling drama is peopled by characters that have been fictionalized into big house cliches.\n",
        "It's a struggle for Bacon -- and I'm not doubting the facts of the matter -- because the part is so clearly designed to knock us out; but Bacon is honest, in touch with Young's sources or lack of them.\n",
        "Slater, who in certain shots looks curiously like Kevin Costner, is an actor with talent, but he is too young for this role, and not confident enough to dial down a little.\n",
        "An example of what happens when a picture has everything going for it except good writing and good direction.\n",
        "As a satirist, [Stone's] an elephant ballerina.\n",
        "This is one of my all time favorite movies, and it put Oliver Stone on my list of 'Best Directors Ever,' right along with Stanley [Kubrick].\n",
        "Stone...doesn't know the meaning of moderation or subtlety, and opts instead for something that is excessive and self-indulgent. It's as if he wants to shout out the statement: 'Look at what I can do! I'm an artist!'\n",
        "Seeing this movie once is not enough. The first time is for the visceral experience, the second time is for the meaning.\n",
        "The main problem with Killers...is that it degenerates into the very thing it criticizes.\n",
        "Welcome to Natural Born Killers, Stone's empty, manic meditation on society's glorification of violence and the ugly heroes it loves to hate.\n",
        "A gut-grabber from New Zealand ... that stays with you for days.\n",
        "As often happens when films are intent on getting a message across, Once Were Warriors can't stop itself from overdoing things.\n",
        "Yet familiar as the pattern is ... the film holds because of the acting and because it functions as travelogue.\n",
        "The actors, many of them of European-Maori descent, are wonderful to look at. They also deliver authoritative yet sympathetic performances that get at the roots, or rootlessness, of their characters.\n",
        "It is powerful and chilling, and directed by Lee Tamahori with such narrative momentum that we are swept along in the enveloping tragedy of the family's life.\n",
        "Works, to some degree, on three levels: the visceral, the emotional, and the intellectual, and it is the amalgamation of these that makes this a memorable film.\n",
        "Reserve judgment until this raw, uncompromising working-class saga is over, and you might find yourself unforgettably moved -- and grateful for the experience.\n",
        "Hoffman doesn't get the chance, or need, to act: he just does things, like Ford.\n",
        "An absolute hoot.\n",
        "This is a picture good enough to make you want to go to the movies and frightening enough to make you wonder if you should avoid the crowds.\n",
        "Displays all the initial symptoms of a promising thriller, it soon degenerates into a low-fever whodunit.\n",
        "One of the great scare stories of our time.\n",
        "Comes off as a shrill, self-important bore.\n",
        "No one likes to be teased, but that's exactly what this movie does to us, with predictably frustrating results.\n",
        "A big, bustling, intermittently dippy melodrama.\n",
        "A clunky thriller.\n",
        "Mathilda is like no New York City girl-child I've ever seen riding the subway. And I couldn't take my eyes off her.\n",
        "A naive fairy tale splattered with blood.\n",
        "Ultimately seems at once too deranged and too mechanical.\n",
        "Besson fails to make much of New York's visual potential, and lazily asks that Leon's expertise be taken on trust. The shallowness was to be expected; the slackness is surprising.\n",
        "The Professional is much too sentimental to sound shockingly amoral in the least. Even in a finale of extravagant violence, it manages to be maudlin.\n",
        "One pretty awesome action movie.\n",
        "The bonding of Mathilda and Leon may be among the strangest in the long, tiresome history of odd-couple movies.\n",
        "It is stylish, darkly humorous, and almost artsy in its approach to the genre.\n",
        "Always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action.\n",
        "Mira Nair's consistent exploration of the search for home is admirable, but her movie is burdened by an unconvincing ensemble that's unable to elevate the serio-comic exploration of Cuban immigrants into a poignant tale.\n",
        "Mira Nair's Mississippi Masala found humor in ethnic chaos, and the Indian-born director does so again.\n",
        "This movie gets its charge not from action pyrotechnics but from its electric barrage of language, wisecracks and dialogue, from the mordant '70s classicism of its long-take camera style and its smart, offbeat, strangely sexy cast.\n",
        "The result, especially in the scenes involving Bruce Willis as a nervy boxer, can be long patches of dialogue that must have tickled Tarantino but will not necessarily resonate for anyone else.\n",
        "The talk is dirty and funny, the violence always waiting just around the corner.\n",
        "Whether you call it razzmatazz, pizazz or sizzle, Pulp Fiction's got it, enough style for a dozen movies and, truth be told, enough story for five.\n",
        "At 153 minutes, the movie does occasionally flirt with tedium, but the risk is worth it: The whole is finally greater than the sum of its pulpy parts. What could have been an anything-goes pastiche has surprising rigor and narrative clarity.\n",
        "In terms of mood and style, it could be the most influential film to come along since Blue Velvet.\n",
        "If you smile at David Mamet's dialogue, you'll laugh out loud at the words of Quentin Tarantino.\n",
        "Tarantino's dialogue, with its densely propulsive, almost lawyerly fervor, its peppery comic blend of literacy and funk, has more snap and fight than most directors' action scenes.\n",
        "Tarantino's guilty secret, which the international critics should have noticed, is that his films are cultural hybrids.\n",
        "Just when you thought the last thing the world needed was another violent, self-conscious, hipster homage to film noir, along comes Tarantino to blow away your deja vu.\n",
        "The way that this picture has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting. Pulp Fiction nourishes, abets, cultural slumming.\n",
        "A spectacularly entertaining piece of pop culture.\n",
        "The overall project is evident: to evict real life and real people from the art film and replace them with generic teases and assorted hommages. Don't expect any of the life experiences of the old movie sources to leak through.\n",
        "It's the way Tarantino embellishes and, finally, interlinks these old chestnuts that makes the film alternately exhilarating and frustrating.\n",
        "A triumphant, cleverly disorienting journey through a demimonde that springs entirely from Mr. Tarantino's ripe imagination, a landscape of danger, shock, hilarity and vibrant local color.\n",
        "Scintillating.\n",
        "There's a special kick that comes from watching something this thrillingly alive.\n",
        "All the details are executed to perfection. Ironies abound in the smallest situations.\n",
        "The movie resurrects not only an aging genre but also a few careers.\n",
        "Writer/director Quentin Tarantino demonstrates his encyclopedic grasp of filmmaking by bending, chopping and deconstructing narrative while keeping a groovy beat.\n",
        "Martin fumbles it from the off. And that, in a nutshell, is reason enough to avoid this as one might any other calamity.\n",
        "Martin has a few inspired moments but in order to get to them you have to wade through a mosh pit of unfunny gags.\n",
        "Remember when Martin was funny?\n",
        "What is our reward for the collective effort of this prestigious assembly? One of the most dreadfully unnecessary movies in recent memory.\n",
        "The soundtrack makes generous use of trombones to indicate humor.\n",
        "One can only hope that something good is coming from all the bad movies that Steve Martin has been appearing in.\n",
        "Wasn't it bad enough the first time?\n",
        "There's a difference between kid-friendly and just regular old dumb.\n",
        "None of it is memorable, though the audience it's aimed at will giggle at the adults gone goofy.\n",
        "Recycling bins have fresher content than this listless exercise in check-the-boxes moviemaking.\n",
        "There's a sort of desperation at work here.\n",
        "For all the obvious cribbing, the filmmakers still seem ill-at-ease with Clouseau's simplistic world view and frank buffoonery.\n",
        "Another Steve Martin comedy, the same old question -- what happened?\n",
        "Serves up enough goofy pranks and fractured wordplay to keep the series purring along.\n",
        "Bottom line: Any laugh's a good laugh these days.\n",
        "Hoary slapstick routines, invariably rushed, are all there is in The Pink Panther 2.\n",
        "[I]f half-hearted remakes of fondly remembered films (and their still more lifeless sequels) are one of the most acute ills currently plaguing Hollywood, [Steve] Martin is arguably the primary vector by which the malady is transmitted.\n",
        "Although comic mayhem follows Martin's Clouseau everywhere, none of it is particularly funny.\n",
        "Robert Redford's best and richest directorial effort...\n",
        "Redford turns a dry subject into high art, matching the achievements of his other directing efforts in Ordinary People and A River Runs Through It.\n",
        "Perfectly pitched, the film brims with insight and wit. Highly recommended.\n",
        "Mr. Redford has made a rich, handsome, articulate film about a subject truly worth talking about.\n",
        "What Redford is saying isn't new, but it has rarely been said in a mainstream movie with this kind of passion.\n",
        "Witty, entertaining, intelligent.\n",
        "The screenplay, by former Washington Post film critic Paul Attanasio, is smart, subtle and ruthless.\n",
        "Crisply directed by Redford from a thought-provoking script by Paul Attanasio, and featuring a slew of strong performances.\n",
        "Manages a trick that few films even dare try -- to take a hard look at personal and public moral issues and still provide dazzling entertainment.\n",
        "An exciting achievement, not only the most accomplished film of Redford's directorial career, but one of the best to carry his name.\n",
        "Written with clean-cut force by Paul Attanasio and directed with panache by Robert Redford.\n",
        "Artfully constructed and beautifully shot.\n",
        "A deadpan black comedy, Sam Raimi's fast-paced movie looks and sounds like a Leone oater but more so.\n",
        "Mr. Raimi is limited by a sketch mentality, which means his jokes tend to be over long before his films end. But his tastes for visual mischief and crazy, ill-advised homage can still make for sly, sporadic fun.\n",
        "What Raimi can't find is a center. He hankers for us to giggle at the brutal archetypes he's parodying and to warm to them, too. It won't wash, pardner.\n",
        "Rarely dull, it is not noticeably compelling either, and as the derivative offshoot of a derivative genre, it inevitably runs out of energy well before any of its hotshots runs out of bullets.\n",
        "As preposterous as the plot was, there was never a line of Hackman dialogue that didn't sound as if he believed it. The same can't be said, alas, for Sharon Stone...\n",
        "Raimi's choice to give the film a comic book-like aura of mingled camp and grit makes for some fitfully energetic and entertaining moments, but it's not enough to overcome The Quick and the Dead's primary fault.\n",
        "You get lots of clothes here, but no emperor.\n",
        "Although Stone may be pleasing to some eyes, she's pretty small in the saddle here -- just an innocuous gender twist on the reluctant cowboy hero. And her story of hellbent revenge is about as compelling as a 30-second fragrance commercial.\n",
        "Though it credits Mr. Altman and Barbara Shulgasser as writers, this film seems practically scriptless, to the point where much of it plays like a first rehearsal.\n",
        "The picture is not a social satire. It's a mess.\n",
        "Altman and his writer, former Chicago Sun-Times reporter Barbara Shulgasser, should have gone further and been meaner; too many of his jokes are generic slapstick, instead of being aimed squarely at industry's targets.\n",
        "Despite some delicious moments, this sluggish, overlong, halfhearted satire feels like a movie that wanted to go somewhere but never got there.\n",
        "The third and best feature of Krzysztof Kieslowski's highly ambitious Three Colors trilogy.\n",
        "Another deft, deeply affecting variation on Krzysztof Kieslowski's recurring theme that people are interconnected in ways they can barely fathom.\n",
        "Stunningly beautiful, powerfully scored and immaculately performed, the film is virtually flawless, and one of the very greatest cinematic achievements of the last few decades. A masterpiece.\n",
        "Red succeeds so stirringly that it also bestows some much-needed magic upon its predecessors.\n",
        "Undaunted by the tremendous emotional and moral valence he has by now invited us to expect, Kieslowski controls the film magnificently, putting to use the shapely formal precision he took an entire career to work out.\n",
        "Visually and emotionally, this is the director's warmest film.\n",
        "What makes Red watchable is Kieslowski's arresting visual sense.\n",
        "Red is not a movie by a filmmaker who has run out of ideas, but one by an artist at the height of his powers.\n",
        "In this final installment of a glorious trilogy ... [Kieslowski] has saved his greatest for last.\n",
        "Jacob is so good in the role, so effective at suggesting a mingling of innocence and intuition, that it's easy to imagine why Red was written with her in mind.\n",
        "This is the kind of film that makes you feel intensely alive while you're watching it.\n",
        "A subtle masterpiece.\n",
        "Even in such a visually sumptuous work, Kieslowski is brave enough to tell us -- through blackouts, blurred focus and commanding stillness -- not to look, but simply to listen.\n",
        "A challenge to the imagination.\n",
        "The rehabilitation of a human spirit after painful tragedy is given stunning, aesthetic dimension.\n",
        "A powerful motion picture.\n",
        "Krzysztof Kieslowski's penetrating, hypnotic meditation on liberty and loss.\n",
        "he love that figures centrally in White appears more as a postulate than as a realized fact. To achieve something more durable and persuasive, real characters are required, not allegorical stick figures.\n",
        "The entertaining second seg of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy is involving, bittersweet and droll.\n",
        "It's often cruel, of course, and cool as an ice-pick, but it's still endowed with enough unsentimental humanity to end with a touching, lyrical admission of the power of love. Essential viewing.\n",
        "How could the creator of Blue, the story of a woman who grieves by moping around Paris in a chichi haircut, possibly have followed it with such a rich, light-handed marvel?\n",
        "Kieslowski, who so keenly satirized the crippling excesses of communism in his earlier work, unflinchingly has a go at training-wheels capitalism, but not without affection for the thawing tundra of his beleaguered mother country.\n",
        "A continuing testament to the Polish director's poetic mastery.\n",
        "In White, which details the agonies of obsessive love, [Kieslowski's] story is more realistic, and his style more prosaic, but the results are no less inscrutable -- and no less engaging.\n",
        "The film works fine on its own.\n",
        "It's probably the friendliest, most enjoyable movie the Polish filmmaker has made.\n",
        "White is the anti- comedy, in between the anti- tragedy and the anti- romance.\n",
        "White is an excellent character study, and the presentation of a twisted love story is compelling.\n",
        "There's something earthy and elemental in this tale that was missing in Blue, something quirky and (measured by Kieslowskian standards) energetic. But there's also something damp and brown, like the sodden Polish countryside he pictures.\n",
        "The rhythms are placid and the camerawork (by Haskell Wexler) is simple and unfussy. The film's a charm.\n",
        "John Sayles' latest marks his entry into family-pic terrain, a crossing that draws pleasant but unexciting results.\n",
        "Moving from passion fish to mystical seals, versatile filmmaker John Sayles' latest is a first-rate, all-ages fairy tale steeped in Irish folklore.\n",
        "This is all rather low-key and uninsistent, but the settings are gorgeous, and Haskell Wexler's cinematography makes the most of them.\n",
        "Tales within tales, a subtle sense of economic and social realities, fine landscape photography and strong performances make for an engrossing, unusual fantasy.\n",
        "One of Mr. Sayles's artistic strengths (and commercial liabilities) is his refusal to make movies that knock you over the head with larger-than-life characters and emotions.\n",
        "Sayles demonstrates again his amazing breadth of interest and the extent to which he can't be pigeonholed.\n",
        "A bauble, perhaps, but smartly mounted and sweetly offered -- a Disney flick with brains.\n",
        "Though its protagonist is a 10-year-old girl, it is a crackling good tale with a sense of wonder and mystery strong enough to captivate any age group.\n",
        "[Sayles's] plodding manner works somewhat to advantage in The Secret of Roan Inish.\n",
        "Only the seals and the sea gulls know The Secret of Roan Inish, a beguiling mystery shrouded in stubborn sea mist.\n",
        "An enchanting story about magic and tradition that is suitable for family viewing.\n",
        "It is the exhilarating account of the way Fiona rediscovers her family's history and reclaims their island.\n",
        "This movie is a stinker in every way, from the one-dimensional acting to the idiot dialogue to the surprisingly monotonous storyline.\n",
        "The Specialist is one of those films that forces the characters through torturous mazes of dialogue and action, to explain a plot that is so unlikely it's not worth the effort.\n",
        "With all the preening, posing and stretching, it's hard to know if The Specialist is an action movie or an exercise video.\n",
        "This movie is excruciatingly dumb.\n",
        "The movie Ed Wood, about the worst director of all time, was made to prepare us for Stargate.\n",
        "[A] loopy, mostly entertaining sci-fi adventure.\n",
        "A cinematic fireworks show without the grand finale.\n",
        "Simply marvelous entertainment.\n",
        "Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing.\n",
        "A testament to the human spirit...\n",
        "A passing reference to 'The Count of Monte Cristo' offers a partial clue to what makes this movie compelling.\n",
        "...a throwback to the kind of serious, literate drama Hollywood used to make.\n",
        "It's a simple story elegantly, cleverly told, not to mention expertly acted.\n",
        "Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic justice in what has come before.\n",
        "It's the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities.\n",
        "It wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on the aforementioned finale.\n",
        "If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.\n",
        "The Shawshank Redemption is all about hope and, because of that, watching it is both uplifting and cathartic.\n",
        "It's a devoutly old-fashioned, spiritually uplifting prison drama about two lifers who must break their emotional shackles before they can finally become free men.\n",
        "Thanks to fine performances and beautiful photography, you get that inspirational jump-start frame after frame.\n",
        "With his gift for rapt pauses, for caressing just the right syllable, Freeman can make a speech like that sound like one of the philosophical nuggets of the ages.\n",
        "The picture's raison d'etre has to be Spacey's 'loud and nasty' performance: he's the sort of actor who grabs you by the throat and beats you about the head without ever lifting his feet from the desk.\n",
        "Mr. Spacey's Buddy is a caricature so dazzling that even Buddy might have to say something nice about it: cool, withering, studiously suave, and spurred by impulses that might seem peevish even in a 2-year-old child.\n",
        "This excessively talky, incoherently plotted, would-be film noir is not very good.\n",
        "To outsiders, all this rage and gnashing of teeth may seem silly and self-absorbed.\n",
        "Sharks is a one-joke movie, and the joke wears thin less than halfway through.\n",
        "[Huang's] plot may be overwritten and the ending may be less than satisfying, but his eye and ear are right.\n",
        "The film has no subtlety, so the one-dimensional story comes across as a sophomoric, pointless tirade.\n",
        "When it comes time to take this drama to another level, addressing the darker and more pertinent issue of why Guy puts up with it and what he wants out of life, Huang is right there.\n",
        "Kevin Spacey, who is the reason to see the picture, is hilariously ruthless as Buddy Ackerman.\n",
        "There doesn't seem to be enough material here to satisfy a full length feature, and the movie, which starts with such promise, begins to drag around its midpoint.\n",
        "A dazzling, frightening tour de force by Kevin Spacey.\n",
        "When Spacey goes ballistic, only to freeze the nitroglycerine in his veins a moment later, you don't want to look anywhere else.\n",
        "Lori Petty does her tough-talking best to breathe some life into the comic-book action, but it's not enough.\n",
        "An aspiring cult film that would rather be cute than dangerous.\n",
        "The movie version of the graphic comic book is a classic case of kitchen-sink filmmaking, in which the principals have thrown everything into the stew, hoping enough will stick to the audience.\n",
        "Lori Petty does a nice job in the title role of this enjoyable 1995 feature based on the postapocalyptic SF comic book and set in the year 2033.\n",
        "Generous souls may try to blame this travesty of the Deadline comic-strip on the studio execs who forced director Talalay to tone down and re-edit her cut.\n",
        "Chief among its strong points is Lori Petty, a buzz-cut fashion plate in a Prozac necklace, who brings the necessary gusto to Tank Girl's flippancy.\n",
        "Watching Tank Girl is as disorienting as waking up in someone else's bad dream. You want to get out as fast as possible, but all the exits seem to be blocked.\n",
        "The story, which feels like a disjointed collection of low-budget rock videos more than a coherent plot, just rocks idly on its pseudo-fashionable backside.\n",
        "The result is a bracing film that's halfway between a string of MTV videos (Courtney Love put together the edgy soundtrack) and some of that network's over-the-top cartoons.\n",
        "One of those chew-the-popcorn, munch-the-candy flicks - - the kind you go into expecting to have a good time, but nothing more. Given those expectations, disappointment is as unlikely as boredom.\n",
        "Enormous energy went into this movie. I could not, however, care about it for much more than a moment at a time, and after awhile its manic energy wore me down.\n",
        "Star Trek Generations has enough verve, imagination and familiarity to satisfy three decades' worth of Trekkers raised on several incarnations of the television skein.\n",
        "At least the special effects and outer space vistas are more handsome than usual.\n",
        "The series' dullest instalment.\n",
        "Generations is predictably flabby and impenetrable in places, but it has enough pomp, spectacle and high-tech small talk to keep the franchise afloat.\n",
        "A rich and absorbing saga.\n",
        "Mostly, Generations spends its running length searching for, and never completely finding, its niche.\n",
        "A flawed but funky adventure involving a time warp known as the Nexus.\n",
        "Here is a movie so concerned with in-jokes and updates for Trekkers that it can barely tear itself away long enough to tell a story.\n",
        "The meeting of Patrick Stewart's Jean Luc Picard and William Shatner's James T. Kirk is worth the price of admission or video rental: it's the clash of the titans, Shakespeare meets the Sixties.\n",
        "[This] predictably trite Tales isn't very scary.\n",
        "There's nothing more static than a stalled fright vehicle.\n",
        "A good-looking, well-wrought film with some knockout special effects, some dark humor and crisp portrayals.\n",
        "Carpenter, whose batting average is dipping dangerously low, shows no grasp of character development, plot line or time passage.\n",
        "A trip to a village of the darned tedious.\n",
        "An enjoyable, if obviously-flawed, amalgamation of horror and science fiction.\n",
        "Stupid is apparently in.\n",
        "It's some indication of the wit involved that Farley is reduced to cracking fat jokes at his own expense.\n",
        "The most peculiar aspect of the movie is that some of it is played straight.\n",
        "Tommy Boy is a good belly laugh of a movie.\n",
        "As a sketch for a Saturday Night Live show, it would have been a tour de force. But as part of this rather unimaginative movie, it's just a bit with a burning desk.\n",
        "The movie is an assembly of cliches and obligatory scenes from dozens of other movies, all its better.\n",
        "It's amazing it has taken Wallace Shawn, Andre Gregory, and director Louis Malle more than 10 years to collaborate again. It was worth the wait, though.\n",
        "The performances are precise, the language is alive and well spoken and the setting is striking, but Vanya on 42nd Street still suffers rather heavily from the limitations of filmed theater.\n",
        "Malle adeptly eases us into the play so we can't tell at what precise moment Chekhov takes over, an ambiguity that becomes the film's triumph as well as its key limitation.\n",
        "There's more power here than in all the multi-million dollar fireworks of Hollywood.\n",
        "The elegant understatement of this production turns it into a livelier experiment, a fluent, gripping version of one of Chekhov's more elusive plays.\n",
        "This live-wire Vanya, freshly observed for the '90s, is fiercely funny, touching and vital.\n",
        "In terms of dramatic action, almost nothing happens, and yet Malle's fluid, invisible style carries us deep into the hearts and minds of these characters.\n",
        "A lovely, intimate rethinking of Anton Chekhov's Russian classic Uncle Vanya.\n",
        "Vanya on 42nd Street may be the most innovative and successful straight film adaptation of any play.\n",
        "A film which reduces Chekhov's \"Uncle Vanya\" to its bare elements: loneliness, wasted lives, romantic hope and despair. To add elaborate sets, costumes and locations to this material would only dilute it.\n",
        "Even if you have a taste as I do for movies about dysfunctional families, you may be a little put off by the Grapes.\n",
        "Suggests that the true heroes are those people who day by day must tend to misfits, and do so with love, tenacity and a determination not to go terminally sour in the process.\n",
        "Hallstrom's finally struck a chord with the Americans, though it's much the same cocktail of whimsy and worry, the eccentric and the banal, that he's been mixing all along.\n",
        "Particularly impressive are the sweet, weirdly idyllic tone of Mr. Hallstrom's direction and Johnny Depp's tender, disarming performance as the long-suffering Gilbert Grape.\n",
        "Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom and his fine cast have endowed the story with a good deal of behavioral truth and unstressed comedy.\n",
        "Director Lasse Halstrom and cinematographer Sven Nykvist do their best to disguise the predictability with their own grace notes. But all the music in the world can't hide a tone this false.\n",
        "There is a good idea for a movie hiding here, but Halstrom has buried it beneath a load of charmless shtick.\n",
        "One of the most enchanting movies of the year.\n",
        "Well-written (albeit a little too long) and competently acted.\n",
        "The presence of Washington lends the picture a much-needed dose of authenticity. But in the end Virtuosity is disconnected and uninvolving.\n",
        "Though Virtuosity connects all the dots to give audiences a roller-coaster ride, the movie begets nothing new: It's stillborn.\n",
        "Virtuosity doesn't always compute, but like last summer's Speed, it is far more fully realized cinematically than many less commercial, more serious pictures.\n",
        "Given Washington's presence and the promise of a virtual reality action story, Virtuosity has some appeal -- provided, of course, the viewers aren't selective.\n",
        "The world of Virtuosity may be spanking new, but the ideas are yesterday's news.\n",
        "Someone should tell Hollywood that the mass-killer genre is dead and that its virtual reality counterpart is already wheezing.\n",
        "Virtuosity is an example of a struggle that goes on in Hollywood between formula and invention.\n",
        "[Bullock] knows one of the secrets of doing romantic comedy: treating the romance as a good joke.\n",
        "Compared to While You Were Sleeping, even the half-baked scenario of the Marisa Tomei-Robert Downey Jr. romance Only You looks witty and inventive.\n",
        "It's Bullock's first shot at a role in which she plays second fiddle neither to males nor special effects. And she turns out to be every bit as delightful as anyone might have expected.\n",
        "A cute premise with engaging leads but little else to keep you awake.\n",
        "It plays like a movie dreamed up by people in a studio marketing department who'd decided to bare their souls.\n",
        "Bullock just about knocks herself exhausted being winsome and lovable.\n",
        "The film's casual warmth may make you tolerate some of the shortcomings -- especially since Bullock seems to be having such a fine time with her first starring role.\n",
        "Director Jon Turteltaub has a smooth style suited to classic farce and knows just how to pace the material to accentuate the positive.\n",
        "As cute and cuddly a bedtime story as anyone could wish for.\n",
        "This is a formula film, but it has the kind of good cheer and fine tuning that occasionally give slickness a good name.\n",
        "Bullock is a genuinely engaging performer, which at least gives the treacle some minty freshness.\n",
        "Cringe-inducing moments abound.\n",
        "A lighthearted, charming nougat for romantics.\n",
        "A feel-good film, warm and good-hearted.\n",
        "A consistently adorable, if utterly predictable, piece of fluff.\n",
        "Recaptures the true spirit of the best kind of modern fairy tale.\n",
        "A perfect example of this unoriginal-but-enjoyable type of film making.\n",
        "A sappy, negligible, thoroughly innocuous romantic comedy vehicle for Sandra Bullock.\n",
        "This movie only shows true tact and understanding when it comes to flattering the audience; everyone on-screen is strictly up for grabs.\n",
        "The trouble with the movie is that there's nothing to Muriel but her false dreams: We never quite glimpse the woman they're hiding.\n",
        "Most of the action is played for broad laughs, and Hogan demonstrates the ability to generate them, even if the humor is base and often cruel, making fun of people's looks and ineptitude.\n",
        "An engaging, funny and sometimes surprisingly tough romantic comedy.\n",
        "[A] gleeful, gaudy tribute to one ungainly misfit and her determination.\n",
        "There's poignant drama in this brash, sometimes overstated film, and Muriel's transformation is truly touching.\n",
        "It's a bright, buoyant comedy about a very sad young woman -- and, regrettably, the mix just doesn't work.\n",
        "Muriel's Wedding isn't a perfect comedy, tragedy, or drama, but it contains enough original elements of each to make it worth a look.\n",
        "The film's good heart keeps it from ever making fun of Muriel, although there are moments that must have been tempting.\n",
        "The Baby-Sitters Club is like an average installment of the series, aimed at girls who can't get enough of their fictional friends in any form.\n",
        "A beautiful film that possesses the power to enchant all ages.\n",
        "85 minutes doesn't provide an adequate format for developing seven distinct characters.\n",
        "Were there not 125 million of Ann M. Martin's Club books currently in print, this cinematically destitute movie might have gone directly to video.\n",
        "A colorful, buoyant, loving tribute to the notion of girlfriends forever.\n",
        "Fans and would-be fans of Ann M. Martin's books may be enthralled, but, for the rest of us, The Baby-Sitters Club is something of an endurance contest.\n",
        "Though the script is predictable, it's not too clumsy.\n",
        "There's nothing very profound here, but we do at least get a nice handling of period and milieu, and pretty good performances of the songs.\n",
        "What pulls you over the bum spots is the electrifying immediacy.\n",
        "The early, pre-fame days of the Beatles are a great subject for a film, but the potential has been only partly realized in Backbeat.\n",
        "The music is loud and raw, but nevertheless evokes the excitement it generated.\n",
        "Backbeat, which for all its pretensions can often be impressively canny and affectionate about its subject, is helped enormously by newly recorded versions of Beatle records.\n",
        "Working with a time period and two crucial characters probably not too familiar to less-than-avid Beatles or rock fans, Softley needs a great performance, and he gets it from Hart.\n",
        "Since director Iain Softley seems more interested in establishing tone and atmosphere than in creating vital personalities, he is unable to harness the full power of his story.\n",
        "Softley is able to enliven a familiar story and famous characters. His cast helps him.\n",
        "At the end, I felt cheated.\n",
        "It's a matter of some dispute whether Roman Polanski's letter to the darker side of the romantic impulse, but there's little question that this is his most emotionally complex movie.\n",
        "Strong playing by topliner Peter Coyote can't compensate for a script that's all over the map and a tone that veers from outre comedy to erotic game-playing.\n",
        "Rich and darkly disturbing, it's also wickedly entertaining.\n",
        "This material obviously appeals to his sense of mischief, which remains alive and well.\n",
        "By turns funny, brilliant, shocking and downright terrible, this choppy, two-hour-plus voyage is for Polanski aficionados who don't mind watching their favorite, aging enfant terrible going gleefully under.\n",
        "Well, of course Bitter Moon is wretched excess. But Polanski directs it without compromise or apology.\n",
        "I'm not sure what audience Polanski intended this movie for, but I'm obviously not in the target group.\n",
        "During 2 1/2 hours of choppy waters, soured love affairs and seasickly moods, the controversial director's Lust Boat becomes the Loathe Boat. By then, it's way too late for Dramamine.\n",
        "The performances, however, are very enjoyable, with first honors going to Chazz Palminteri and Dianne Wiest.\n",
        "A backstage comedy bolstered by healthy shots of prohibition gangster melodrama and romantic entanglements.\n",
        "No! Don't speak! See it!\n",
        "Mr. Allen has drawn on autobiographical specifics in other films, but this may be the one in which he speaks most seriously from the heart.\n",
        "If not bowled over, we're at least won over.\n",
        "One of Allen's best and most revealing comedies, as much a moral meditation as it is dazzling fun.\n",
        "Has more laughs packed into its exquisitely orchestrated 99 minutes than anything [Allen's] done in nearly 20 years.\n",
        "Woody Allen at his best -- a gem of a Broadway fable with a crafty premise, a raft of brilliant actors at the top of their form and a bouncy, just-for-pleasure attitude.\n",
        "The most insightful and deliciously droll look at show business since Robert Altman skewered Hollywood in 1992's The Player.\n",
        "Buzzes with classic one-liners, bright performances and off-the-cuff contemplations about love, art and death.\n",
        "The most substantive, accessible -- not to mention the funniest -- film that the prolific writer-director has made in years.\n",
        "The movie is very funny and, in the way it follows its logic wherever it leads, surprisingly tough.\n",
        "This is the third movie with Jack as its hero, so he is a known quantity -- a humanist spook with an overdeveloped moral sense -- but Ford, playing the part for the second time, knows how to keep his earnestness fresh.\n",
        "Narrative complexity and momentum make this a true cinematic equivalent of an absorbing page-turner.\n",
        "There's a glimmer of interest in the film's ideological contortions, but as a commercial action thriller this is inflated and sluggish.\n",
        "In a film that opens with the sight of a waving American flag, subtlety may not be foremost on anyone's mind. But Mr. Ford's wary intelligence does wonders for a potentially one-dimensional character.\n",
        "For what it is, Clear and Present Danger is fun to sit through.\n",
        "The film seems to have its pulse on some peculiarly modern varieties of madness.\n",
        "[Noyce] dramatizes Tom Clancy's obsessively detailed plot in a straightforward fashion while staging spectacular showpieces of action.\n",
        "An absorbing, if overlong adaptation of Tom Clancy's bestseller.\n",
        "The uneven flow is as likely to lead to a snoozing viewer as to one on the edge of their seat.\n",
        "It's a successful frame-turner, no more, no less, and the pleasure we feel is every bit as mild and just as fleeting.\n",
        "A high-voltage charge of suspense, action and humor.\n",
        "It twists and turns in all the expected places, and almost never rises above the ordinary.\n",
        "Mindless, non-taxing fun, especially if you haven't read the book.\n",
        "Not as satisfying as it should be.\n",
        "This isn't a masterpiece of suspense, but it has its moments and is capable of providing some light summer entertainment.\n",
        "Cobb cuts right through the winner-take-all ethos of American athletics. It's a raw, inspired, audaciously funny, and unexpectedly moving collaboration between the writer-director Ron Shelton and Tommy Lee Jones.\n",
        "Ty Cobb is such a towering figure in this motion picture that it's easy to overlook Al Stump -- and Robert Wuhl's feisty, witty performance in the thankless role.\n",
        "[Jones] lets it all loose here. It's the performance of a lifetime: full of menace and venom, eloquence and fire, rot and pathos, crackling rawness and realism.\n",
        "The result, whether Cobb is wailing about greatness or ruminating about the dark circumstances around his father's death, is a performance too operatic and out of control.\n",
        "This is a messy movie, sometimes repetitive, sometimes too compressed and allusive. But that's like saying Ty Cobb was not a very good sport -- irrelevant in comparison to the horrific fascination of his story.\n",
        "It's such a potent and courageous wreck of a movie that it's worth more than most 'successes.'\n",
        "It's unclear just how much sympathy we are to extend the unrepentant and bullying title character.\n",
        "Shelton's film is about the nature of truth and popular myth, about the single-minded pursuit of glory, and the horrors within. It's also very funny.\n",
        "Even allowing for the intentional excesses of such an episode, delicacy is a casualty here.\n",
        "This histrionic portrait of the most celebrated cur in sports history comes across like a fly ball that thuds on the ground.\n",
        "Shelton's strong, stinging film -- one of the year's best -- wants to get at something ingrained in the American character: the irrational desire to make saints of sports heroes.\n",
        "It's the kind of film where you admire the craftsmanship and artistry while questioning the wisdom of the project itself.\n",
        "Jones' on-target portrayal of the dying athlete is mesmerizing.\n",
        "Of all the good and great movies that have slipped through the cracks in recent years, none has been treated as appallingly as Cobb.\n",
        "Cobb turns into a noisy, cantankerous buddy picture.\n",
        "While the movie may act like a madeleine for television-obsessed baby-boomers, it works even better as a colorful playland that will appeal to small children.\n",
        "A $45 million design problem with 98 minutes of weak prehistoric jokes.\n",
        "Just watching it is fun. Following the plot is not so much fun.\n",
        "It's a dull day in Bedrock.\n",
        "Maybe it's because so many of the things they do in the movie are lifted directly from the show, but a lot of stuff seems stale.\n",
        "As Fred Flintstone might have put it: yabba-dabba-boo.\n",
        "It's most successful when it is being off-center, a state of grace it doesn't quite have the nerve to maintain.\n",
        "This isn't the meaningful movie it pretends to be. But as a goofy entertainment that speeds through the latter half of the 20th century, stopping here and there to snap a photo or two, Forrest Gump does just fine.\n",
        "Good as Wright and Sinise are in their roles as Forrest's near-suicidal soulmates, the movie always comes back to Hanks, and director Robert Zemeckis helps him to achieve some of his finest emotional moments.\n",
        "The movie's technical tricks are great fun, as is its musical soundtrack, which captures the essences of the eras it traverses. But when you come right down to it, it's the oddly magnetic personality of Forrest himself that is the biggest draw.\n",
        "This tall tale may reach monumental proportions, but Forrest Gump always keeps its magical airiness and grace.\n",
        "Credit for the success of the film has to start with director Robert Zemeckis, who has taken his Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit success and parlayed it into a more mature, yet equally entertaining, film.\n",
        "Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell.\n",
        "For all its ambition, the movie ends up using great historical events in the service of a dubious sentimentality.\n",
        "A picaresque story of a simpleton's charmed odyssey through 30 years of tumultuous American history, Forrest Gump is whimsy with a strong cultural spine.\n",
        "Judging by the the movie's enduring popularity, the message that stupidity is redemption is clearly what a lot of Americans want to hear.\n",
        "As this mawkish conservative movie ultimately goes to prove: ignorance is bliss.\n",
        "Forrest Gump has the elements of an emotionally gripping story. Yet it feels less like a romance than like a coffee-table book celebrating the magic of special effects.\n",
        "Skillfully adapted by screenwriter Eric Roth, the story belongs in the company of such sweet classics as Rain Man and Harvey.\n",
        "A movie heart-breaker of oddball wit and startling grace.\n",
        "Like the best movie actors, Hanks is a superb reactor.\n",
        "This is one summer movie that doesn't evaporate the minute you leave the theater.\n",
        "Hanks is so charming as Gump, so heroic in his guilelessness and belief in simple virtues, that you want to excuse the film's excesses and overlook Zemeckis' weakness for easy, maudlin sentiment.\n",
        "Passionate and magical, Forrest Gump is a tonic for the weary of spirit.\n",
        "Hanks is superb, reemploying the childlike presence he brought to Big.\n",
        "What a magical movie.\n",
        "Although the film is basically a light romantic comedy, it couldn't be more psychologically astute in its portrait of a man who defines himself by his bachelorhood, which empowers him to get past his fear of commitment.\n",
        "Deftly written by Richard Curtis and directed by the versatile Mike Newell, Four Weddings is as good as its word, breezily following a small circle of friends through every one of the events the title promises.\n",
        "Four Weddings and a Funeral is one of those rare films that have you smiling from the get-go, and keep you that way -- with a few well-earned poignant interludes (including, of all things, a reading of W.H. Auden) -- right to the end.\n",
        "Hugh Grant's body English captures every nuance of his character's confusion precisely and hilariously.\n",
        "The setup is too arch to support the movie's detour into poignance, though John Hannah does give a moving reading of W. H. Auden's \"Funeral Blues.\"\n",
        "The infectious charm and sunny goodwill of Four Weddings and a Funeral can so immediately buoy a soul ravaged by winter weather and winter movies.\n",
        "There are movies so breezy, even flimsy, that you can enjoy them as genial providers of an evening's entertainment yet forget all about them by the time you leave the multiplex.\n",
        "A grocery store would sell this on its generic shelf: the brittle upper-class British cleverness is strictly standard issue.\n",
        "Truly beguiling romantic comedy is one of the hardest things for a modern film to pull off, but a winning British team has done it in Four Weddings and a Funeral.\n",
        "A British comedy that's classy and commercial -- and, most important, very, very funny.\n",
        "If ever a film resembled a wedding cake it is Four Weddings and a Funeral, a multi-tiered confection with a romantic spirit and an enchantingly pretty veneer.\n",
        "The players, who include Simon Callow, Kristin Scott Thomas, Rowan Atkinson and Sophie Thompson, exude comedic brightness as they go about their gossipy, farcical, self-deprecating, sorry-about-that-old-chap, just-being-English business.\n",
        "The simplest and most honest expression of praise that I can offer Mike Newell's latest movie is that it represents two hours of solid movie magic.\n",
        "Delightful and sly.\n",
        "Some of the funniest scenes bounce off the nightmares of every bride and groom before the wedding.\n",
        "Despite some likable performances (Epps is especially winning), the drama in Higher Learning is constricted, hemmed in by Singleton's compulsion to view his characters as walking paradigms of racial and sexual politics.\n",
        "Higher Learning has a great many things on its mind, which immediately places it in a rather exclusive category of American films these days.\n",
        "A stylish, intelligent film-maker, Singleton interweaves the threads of his demographic tapestry with assurance, passion and a welcome awareness of the complexities of the college community's contradictory impulses towards integration and separatism.\n",
        "Everyone here, from beer-swilling white fraternity boys to rap-loving black students harassed by the campus police, can be judged at face value. Everyone is exactly what he or she seems.\n",
        "Higher Learning is often cliched, unfocused and didactic. But Singleton has a goal most of his contemporaries have given up on: He wants to make a movie that makes a difference.\n",
        "Presenting problems is not the same as dramatizing them successfully, and as strong as his message is, Singleton has not found the best way to deliver it.\n",
        "It's not as dispensable as Singleton's sophomore effort, Poetic Justice, but it's a long way from the assured freshman storytelling of Boyz N the Hood.\n",
        "Despite excesses and missteps, there is still a wealth of digestible, thought-provoking material in Higher Learning.\n",
        "Singleton has made all the right political moves given his complicated circumstances, but he hasn't really made a movie of them.\n",
        "For every persuasive insight John Singleton brings to Higher Learning, his thoughtful but flawed movie about multiculturalism and racism, he throws in something equally disappointing.\n",
        "Thought-provoking.\n",
        "Higher Learning presents a profoundly uninspired and misguided piece that seems prompted by little more than a desire to make a Big Statement.\n",
        "Bergman...really brings home the homage to Capra with the pic's warm, bordering-on-irresistible finale.\n",
        "Perez has a field day as Muriel, injecting a welcome note of good old-fashioned greed into what is otherwise a relentlessly edifying story.\n",
        "Sweetness is fine as far as it goes, but this oddball romance could have used a twist of lemon.\n",
        "Simply and without pandering or insults to your intelligence, the movie delivers more of the old-style pleasures of moviegoing than any other picture in a long while.\n",
        "Bergman never goes for heavy-handed schmaltz, and the whole movie has the same lighthearted big city spirit as the New York Post headlines that follow the story.\n",
        "If you're looking for a late summer, \"feel good\" romantic comedy, there aren't too many around more affable than this one.\n",
        "The nastiness in the movie feels derived from life, while all the niceness feels canned -- imported from old Jimmy Stewart pictures.\n",
        "In the end, It Could Happen to You is a lot like the cop and the waitress: sweet, naive, not too smart, but likable.\n",
        "The standout song goes to Harris, a rhythmic 'Bare Necessities' extolling the value of a simple life and credited to Terry Gilkyson.\n",
        "A serious disappointment, recommended only for inveterate Disney fans and very young people.\n",
        "It's also got great knockabout visual gags, mercifully little cutey-poo sentiment, and reasonable songs.\n",
        "This is more often self-portrait than portrait; like Hitler in Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, she's presented as a fully formed deity without family background or ideology save a reverence for beauty and strength.\n",
        "Sometimes clunky but consistently fascinating.\n",
        "This movie is fascinating in so many different ways: As the story of an extraordinary life, as the reconstruction of the career of one of the greatest of film artists, as the record of an ideological debate, as a portrait of an amazing old woman.\n",
        "Overly long, but fascinating.\n",
        "The Lion King, complete with jaunty songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, is undeniably and fully worthy of its glorious Disney heritage. It is a gorgeous triumph -- one lion in which the studio can take justified pride.\n",
        "Between traumas, the movie serves up soothingly banal musical numbers (composed by Elton John and Tim Rice) and silly, rambunctious comedy.\n",
        "It's perhaps the closest Disney has come to creating a consciously mythical entertainment in the style of Star Wars. Yet like that film it keeps its sense of humor and fun.\n",
        "Even with its flaws, this latest Disney animated feature once again delivers what its audience wants. Too bad flesh and blood films can't be this consistent.\n",
        "It bears repeating that The Lion King is quite entertaining as children's fare goes these days. But Disney has established a standard so high on animated features that anything less than a classic leaves you feeling that something's missing.\n",
        "The rest of The Lion King alternates between grand-opera melodrama and low-comedy hi-jinks, superbly blending the two approaches.\n",
        "Everyone, young and old, will find something to appreciate in this Shakespearean tale of a young lion discovering his rightful place in the world.\n",
        "The story line is a Joseph Campbell hero-quest so stripped down to its basics as to become dull.\n",
        "A computer-animated scene featuring a stampede of wildebeest is positively breathtaking.\n",
        "The Lion King, more than any of the recent wave of Disney animated features, has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but as an emotionally pungent movie.\n",
        "The result is a step toward multiculturalism and ecological correctness, though not without a certain amount of confusion.\n",
        "A winner.\n",
        "A crown jewel of modern Disney animation.\n",
        "More so than the exuberant movie miracles that came before it, this latest animated juggernaut has the feeling of a clever, predictable product.\n",
        "A royal treat.\n",
        "Some of the richest imagery the studio's animators have produced and held together.\n",
        "There clearly has been a conscious effort to please adults as much as children. Happily, for those of us who generally stay far away from 'cartoons,' they have succeeded.\n",
        "It's all calculated to be wonderfully entertaining and almost every frame hits the mark.\n",
        "An ingenious mixture of themes from narrative sources as ancient and varied as Hamlet, the Old Testament and The Odyssey.\n",
        "A superbly drawn animated feature.\n",
        "Bertolucci's celebrated burnt-orange-and-burnished-lemon look remains handsome, and the story itself still commands some interest as a pivot into daunting material.\n",
        "Bertolucci's epic is a disappointment.\n",
        "A crazily mesmerizing pop artifact that ranks alongside Herman Hesse's novel Siddhartha in terms of extreme earnestness and quasi-religious entertainment value.\n",
        "Though uneven, the film is engagingly moving and often humorous.\n",
        "Little Buddha succeeds precisely because of its guileless innocence.\n",
        "The modern sequences lack realism or credibility. The ancient sequences play like the equivalent of a devout Bible story.\n",
        "As beautifully photographed and intelligently-written as the movie is, it has no emotional depth or appeal, and is often as cold and clinical as its gray depiction of Seattle.\n",
        "This one's defeated by the rigid formula.\n",
        "Englund once again is in bravura form as Freddy, playing as much for nasty laughs as unnerving shocks.\n",
        "The climactic punch-up fails to match the power of the first film's true ending, but in deconstructing his own bastardised creation, Craven redeems both the series and his own tarnished reputation.\n",
        "An ingenious, cathartic exercise in illusion and fear.\n",
        "An intricately constructed horror film, it not only takes you to hell and back, but thoroughly engages the mind as well as the emotions.\n",
        "It's witty, smart, funny, entertaining, and you'll still like yourself in the morning for watching it.\n",
        "[Craven] has brought back a sense of genuine horror to the series, in part by taking it to completely new ground, and in part by giving his actors a legitimate script to work with.\n",
        "I haven't been exactly a fan of the Nightmare series, but I found this movie, with its unsettling questions about the effect of horror on those who create it, strangely intriguing.\n",
        "The new film recaptures the dark soul of the original through a clever conceit.\n",
        "The picture starts to fall in love with its subject -- head- over-heels in love, until the acid drains from the wit and there's nothing left but sentimental ooze.\n",
        "It's all slick, fizzy fun. But the film's fighting spirit gets snatched.\n",
        "Watching The Paper got me in touch all over again with how good it feels to work at the top of your form, on a story you believe in, on deadline.\n",
        "Perfectly captures the hubbub of the nation's newsrooms.\n",
        "Thanks to a caffeinated cast and hyperactive script, director Ron Howard delivers The Paper with a bang.\n",
        "A crowd pleaser, and, regardless of any viewer's experience (or lack thereof) with the behind-the-scenes wrangling that goes on in newspaper offices, the story is affable and entertaining.\n",
        "Ryder and Hawke bring crucial authenticity to their roles with effortless appeal. You'll find yourself wanting more of these characters than the movie gives you.\n",
        "However conventional Reality Bites resolves to be, it is always engaging. Best of all, Ryder has her greatest role since Heathers, once again proving herself a seriously funny young actress.\n",
        "It's a good example of an anti-establishment comedy crippled by a seeming desire to infatuate the establishment itself. What Reality Bites needs most is a good bite. From reality.\n",
        "Among the movie's strengths are the performances, especially that of Ryder, who comes across as bright, beautiful and more delicate than ever before.\n",
        "When the movie is over, you don't feel as if you had shared the experience of a new generation; you feel puzzled and vaguely crummy, as if you had just read a solemn news-magazine cover story about it.\n",
        "Yearning, hilarious, lost within their precocious self-awareness, these slackers have soul.\n",
        "Although it never became the definitive document of Generation X, Reality Bites is a touchstone for anyone just out of college and stuck with more ideals than job prospects, not to mention a head full of bad-TV trivia.\n",
        "In 1994, the novelty of seeing a romantic comedy written and directed by, as well as starring, people in their early 20s made for a certain freshness, but after a point this 'youthfulness' consists of little more than TV references.\n",
        "Reality Bites begins as a promising and eccentric tale of contemporary youth but evolves into a banal love story as predictable as any lush Hollywood affair.\n",
        "There's probably a moderate little romantic comedy crying to get out here, but the film's vain striving for casual hip proves suffocatingly obtrusive.\n",
        "Like the generation it presents so appealingly, it doesn't see any point in getting all bent out of shape and overambitious. But it knows how to hang out and have a great time.\n",
        "What unwritten law prevented the makers of Reality Bites from observing that their heroine can't shoot video worth a damn, that their hero is a jerk, and that their villain is the most interesting person in the movie?\n",
        "The story may not be new, but it is as fresh as the film's new faces.\n",
        "Beneath a thin veneer of style lie buried all the old cliches and formulas of typical romantic comedies.\n",
        "[Childress and Stiller] encapsulate an era.\n",
        "It's well worth tracking down, wherever you can find it. For it has the kind of tension and energy -- maybe even a touch of delirium -- that is only a memory in most of today's big studio movies.\n",
        "A wry thriller with a keen edge.\n",
        "A rather ho-hum if watchable neo-noir, though it's been treated in some quarters as something special.\n",
        "[A] well-played, highly entertaining and playfully ingenious thriller.\n",
        "It should never have fallen through the cracks. This clever little film is a real find.\n",
        "It is a treasure waiting to be discovered.\n",
        "It's the kind of movie made by people who love movies, have had some good times at them, and want to celebrate the very texture of old genres like the western and the film noir.\n",
        "Red Rock West is a roller-coaster ride of a film, designed for those who like their thrillers spiced with the unexpected.\n",
        "Director John Dahl and his brother Rick Dahl co-wrote the intelligent and off-handedly witty script; they're like the Coen brothers, but with a sense of fun and a coherent, entertaining story to tell.\n",
        "Decently crafted but oddly charmless.\n",
        "Unendurable.\n",
        "Most of the time, Richie Rich is too busy oohing and ahhing over the junk that money can buy to relax and have a good time.\n",
        "A spirited and fluffy kids' comedy.\n",
        "What's sort of wonderful is the way this movie takes that old formula and makes it fresh and new, with actors who give it wit and charm.\n",
        "The filmmakers seem to think of their movie as a fiduciary fable, but they're not quite sure about its moral.\n",
        "Van Damme is compelling only when he takes his clothes off.\n",
        "For the most part, Hyams' lackluster direction and the repetitive quality of the action sequences squander an intriguing premise and impressive production design, leaving few moments that elicit the sort of 'Wow!' response such fare needs in order to pros\n",
        "SF specialist Peter Hyams, doubling as usual as director and cinematographer, leaves his record for mediocrity unblemished in this silly time-travel tale.\n",
        "Hyams is no stranger to large-scale sci-fi, so his management of the massive sets and slightly mechanical fx is more than adequate.\n",
        "Years of tireless persistence have begun to work in Mr. Van Damme's favor. It's hard not to enjoy his energy, even if his acting gifts still leave a lot to be desired.\n",
        "Maybe it's the formula, maybe it's all that time travel, but you just can't help thinking you've seen it all before.\n",
        "A satisfying science-fiction thriller.\n",
        "In spite of its glitches, Timecop is lots of fun, a blast from the past.\n",
        "Timecop, a low-rent Terminator, is the kind of movie that is best not thought about at all, for that way madness lies.\n",
        "Time paradoxes are supposed to be mind-boggling; Timecop has reduced them to a level somewhere between confusing and dumb.\n",
        "Good dumb fun.\n",
        "If the Gulf War gave you an insatiable taste for burning oil and burning Arabs, this extravaganza will tide you over for at least a couple of days.\n",
        "Providing its share of fun in stretches, pic ultimately overstays its welcome with a level of mayhem that will simply feel like too much for any marginal fan of the genre.\n",
        "Half the time, this hi-tech action movie delivers, in a mindless kind of way: it's fast, crude and has enough explosions and cartoon-style violence to satisfy our baser instincts.\n",
        "As this comedy of manners unfolds, it is played for all-out action as well as satiric humor.\n",
        "However high your ranking on the culture scale, I defy you to watch this and leave the theatre without a whistled 'Wow' followed by a grudging 'That's entertainment.'\n",
        "An old-fashioned, high-tech, fun time at the movies.\n",
        "This mixture of comedy and super-agent spectacle works well at first. But when Schwarzenegger's family and working worlds link up -- an inevitable development -- the plot becomes increasingly ridiculous and overwrought.\n",
        "On the basis of stunts, special effects and pure action, it delivers sensationally.\n",
        "True Lies, far too technologically bloated for its cartoony plot, overestimates the human tolerance for high-tech mayhem.\n",
        "The fun of an elaborately scaled comic suspense thriller is that, no matter how spectacular the stunts are, the hero always seems to be operating out of the purest pragmatism.\n",
        "If he'd followed through, Mike Nichols might have made a brilliant picture -- seems he just couldn't bear to look a gift wolf in the mouth.\n",
        "Nichols has crafted a rapturous romantic thriller with a darkly comic subtext about what kills human values.\n",
        "Nichols has allowed Wolf to evolve from a well-mounted, supernatural drama to goofy camp.\n",
        "A sometimes shaky, always enchanting Beauty and the Beast story for grown-ups that is the very essence of smart fun -- droll, sophisticated and surprisingly, pleasingly light.\n",
        "An effective attempt to place a werewolf story in an incongruous setting, with the closely observed details of that setting used to make the story seem more believable.\n",
        "It's a wonderfully entertaining and beautifully performed film.\n",
        "Monster movies are supposed to frighten the audience; this one fails utterly in that arena.\n",
        "Director Joel Schumacher does a fair job of managing the chaos, but after a while you get tired of being dragged from setup to setup.\n",
        "If you've seen the trailer, you've seen almost everything good in Bad Company.\n",
        "Rock doesn't really act with the other performers; he stands next to them and buzzes in his own orbit.\n",
        "Despite its cliche-ridden premise, Bad Company often works simply because there's so much talent on the screen.\n",
        "Predictably soulless techno-tripe.\n",
        "Producer Jerry Bruckheimer demands the kind of formula action that leaves director Joel Schumacher no space to let characters breathe.\n",
        "Deft, funny and intelligently scary.\n",
        "Hopkins breezes through the proceedings with an appealingly jaded nonchalance ... that easily morphs into steely authority whenever such stern stuff is required.\n",
        "Bad Company is a bad movie with really bad timing.\n",
        "A long-winded, predictable scenario.\n",
        "More a gunfest than a Rock concert.\n",
        "Bad Company leaves a bad taste, not only because of its bad-luck timing, but also the staleness of its script.\n",
        "Feels like the kind of movie that might have been designed by a marketing software program for MBA studio executives.\n",
        "If you can cut the right wires and deactivate key portions of your brain, Bad Company is sort of fun and sort of funny -- although it doesn't take a CIA agent like Jack Ryan to note that that phrase always means a movie ain't much good.\n",
        "Seems more like a product than an attempt to tell a story.\n",
        "In terms of action, Wayans the director relies too much on slow-motion in shooting action scenes -- a tiresome habit that undercuts the potential excitement of some sequences.\n",
        "So far, so hackneyed.\n",
        "Mr. Wayans is an agreeable screen presence, but he makes a surprisingly bland action hero.\n",
        "Wayans isn't sure whether to send up Shaft and company or simply to remake the action thriller. The result is an embarrassing compromise.\n",
        "Here is a movie about guns. Take away the guns, and the movie would be about nothing much.\n",
        "It's easy -- far too easy -- to use the title of Keenen Ivory Wayans' latest movie as a description. Unfortunately, it's also accurate.\n",
        "Something more subtle is going on in Wolff's book, a confrontation with a richer, quirkier past and his emerging self that the movie too often brushes aside.\n",
        "The leads work overtime to make their characters and their relationships pungent, believable, and moving.\n",
        "Nicely acted but excessively bland.\n",
        "It's a rites-of-passage drama with the kind of period small-town setting that the director is making his own.\n",
        "This Boy's Life is so steeped in period detail (music, cars, television shows, hair styles) that Toby and Caroline's sad, bumbling search for freedom seems secondary, almost impolite to the decor.\n",
        "An indisputably great actor is inching toward the black hole of self-parody.\n",
        "It is an affecting teen melodrama haunted by twisted treehouse memories.\n",
        "Ultimately, This Boy's Life is effective because we get to know the characters, understand their circumstances, and empathize with their dreams.\n",
        "Apparently left by director Michael Caton-Jones to his own devices, De Niro's familiar, tight-lipped intensity is entertaining and watchable. But in this Boy's Life Magazine context, it hovers close to cartoonlike.\n",
        "The movie is very involving.\n",
        "Some good performances emerge from a one-note script via very good Russ Meyer direction and his outstanding editing.\n",
        "A cheap and efficient comic horror movie, it's funniest when its dialogue and characters' behaviour are at their most non sequitur.\n",
        "I guess plunging necklines and tight shorts aren't what they used to be... Not that such a realization will hamper anyone's enjoyment of this, or any other, Meyer endeavor.\n",
        "What is it about Meyer that spurs critics to this hyperbole? I think it is an intensely personal reaction to the visceral power of Meyer's unusual images.\n",
        "Far less captivating than the videogame that inspired it.\n",
        "Julia (in his final role) hams it up shamelessly as the camp commandant, but not even his suave presence and throwaway quips can save this noisy, brainless mess.\n",
        "A dreary, overstuffed hodgepodge of poorly edited martial arts sequences and often unintelligible dialogue.\n",
        "Game Over.\n",
        "Arriving more than a few years after author Robert Bly popularized the concept of male self-exploration, this Canadian documentary seems a bit too touchy-feely even for the age of Oprah.\n",
        "The tribe's unfailing politeness outside of activities specifically designed to arouse testosterone underlines the suspiciously benign nature of the entire endeavor.\n",
        "Though it generates its share of unintentional giggles, Fran&#231;ois Kohler's documentary manages to take us to a seldom-visited place: the hidden corners of the straight male mind.\n",
        "Desert Wind will be of interest to men -- and especially to women, who might learn much they didn't know about the opposite sex.\n",
        "We sense that the balance of the film's observations is being skewed by the camera's preference for the emotional exhibitionists in the bunch.\n",
        "It's tough to connect with the almost context-free displays of emotion, and a century into the era of psychoanalysis, there's little about the men's assorted troubles with mothers and fathers, wives and girlfriends, that comes as a revelation.\n",
        "It's hard to understand why Martin Scorsese wanted to remake a nasty, formulaic 1962 thriller whose only \"classic\" credentials are a terrifying performance by Robert Mitchum and a Bernard Herrmann score.\n",
        "Smart and stylish.\n",
        "Overblown horror-schlocker.\n",
        "Stay away if you're squeamish but, if you do, you'll miss an essential work by one of our masters, as well as two of the year's most accomplished performances, those of Mr. De Niro and Ms. Lewis.\n",
        "Though Scorsese doesn't always transcend the pulp in Cape Fear, watching him try allows us to share the exhilaration he experiences behind the camera.\n",
        "It's a helluva movie.\n",
        "It's a brutal, demonic film with a grip like a vise; it grabs you early, its fingers around your throat, and never lets go.\n",
        "Impressive moviemaking, showing Scorsese as a master of a traditional Hollywood genre who is able to mold it to his own themes and obsessions.\n",
        "Proves that when a maverick virtuoso like Scorsese sets his mind to it, making ''mainstream'' movies is one more thing he can do better than just about anyone else.\n",
        "I have to say that the humour here (some of it Pythonesque) is mostly spot on and, at times, mischievously dark.\n",
        "It's just okay.\n",
        "Now that we've made one of the best computer-generated talking-animal-on-an-odyssey movies in the brief but busy history of the genre, can we please, please move on?\n",
        "A little bit like Over the Hedge, and a lot like the upcoming Flushed Away, in which an animated house mouse is forced to fend for himself in the sewers of London, Open Season may sound a bit familiar, but it is never dull.\n",
        "With animated movies coming out every other week or so, mediocrity is becoming a rule. Open Season loses more points than most films because of its similarities to Over the Hedge, one of the few kids films that did it right this year.\n",
        "It's not deep and not totally original. But Open Season is whiplash quick with the gags and spot-on with the funny voices.\n",
        "An ugly, painfully derivative and sleep-inducing talking-animals cartoon laced with potty humor.\n",
        "A story that balances gentle messages with enough goofy anarchy to please any kid.\n",
        "Open Season is a rambunctious blast. It's Sony Pictures Animation's first full-length feature film and no effort was spared getting it right.\n",
        "For an inaugural effort, Open Season ain't bad, but the studio shows far more promise with its gee-whiz visuals than it does in the story department.\n",
        "The movie is a genial romp and because it relies on the gentlest of scatological comedy, it can be enjoyed by all ages.\n",
        "The film wraps mindless cartoon violence and a few fart jokes around life lessons about friendship and responsibility. Kids should like it; parents won't mind it.\n",
        "Some theaters are showing the movie in IMAX 3D, which is the way I saw it. The novelty helps, but it still can't bring depth to entertainment this shallow.\n",
        "One of the biggest surprises in this first full-length film from Sony Pictures Animation is how funny Ashton Kutcher is as Elliot.\n",
        "This debut offering from Sony Pictures Animation has a giddy energy about it and a gleeful sense of its own weirdness.\n",
        "While the filmmakers here have provided us with a passable tale that is mildly humorous, Open Season breaks no new ground, from neither the animation nor the storytelling.\n",
        "When your most distinctive element is Ashton Kutcher as a one-antlered mule deer, respect has reason to elude you.\n",
        "Corrente's handling of class divisions (one of the heroes starts seeing a Brown University senior he sells cocaine to) and the body language of the performances keep things fresh.\n",
        "Producer-director-scripter Michael Corrente manages to bring freshness to basically derivative material in Federal Hill, thanks to a number of excellent performances and some evocative black-and-white images of a world he knows intimately.\n",
        "Federal Hill is lively and likable, a first film with the kind of swift action, clever dialogue and clear-cut characters that suggest an expert director's touch.\n",
        "Federal Hill has sincerity on its side and a fair degree of authenticity.\n",
        "There is nothing terribly different or exciting about what he shows us; the film is gripping in a conventional, formulaic way.\n",
        "The movie has a good ear for the way the characters talk, dress, move and live; it's another Italian-American slice-of-life, well acted and directed.\n",
        "With the possible exception of utilizing an atypical location (Providence, Rhode Island's Federal Hill as opposed to New York City or Long Island), there is little in this film that hasn't been done before, and better.\n",
        "Though Corrente, who wrote, produced and directed this debut feature, displays a sure, confident hand, his style and sensibility aren't singular enough to make this collection of behavioral details feel original.\n",
        "Uneven as it is, Addams Family Values is considerably more enjoyable than its predecessor. At this rate, if there's a third installment, it'll be a knockout. Or at least a TKO.\n",
        "You've got to respect a comedy that makes light of arson, torture, and murder in these squeamish times.\n",
        "Somehow, the new production fails to sustain the creepy, kooky, mysterious, spooky and altogether ooky visual sweep that held the first film together.\n",
        "At its best, it's a valentine of venom, sent with mirth and malice aforethought.\n",
        "Even if the sequel doesn't offer the delight of discovery, the trip back to Chateau Addams is more than the dead end it could have been.\n",
        "Like the first of the Addams chronicles, this is an essentially lazy movie, too often settling for easy gags and special effects that don't come to any really funny point.\n",
        "As sequels go, this is passable...\n",
        "It remains perilously slim in the story department, but glides over the thin ice with technical razzle-dazzle and an exceptionally winning cast.\n",
        "The comedy has moved into high gear and become one of the funniest, most mean-spirited satirical assaults on sunny American values since the salad days of W.C. Fields.\n",
        "As sequels go, this is passable: no more coherent than the episodic first instalment, but with enough sick humour to satisfy the mildly depraved.\n",
        "Mr. Sonnenfeld repeats some of the first film's favorite visual stunts without wearing out their welcome, and he sustains much more exuberance than a sequel might be expected to have.\n",
        "A few sparkling performances and funny moments save this from being a complete waste of time, but it's not a promising way to start the Thanksgiving/Christmas movie season.\n",
        "A thinner, airier reunion.\n",
        "Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston are given a lot of one-liners and payoff gags, of course, but what's funny is the stuff that comes in between -- the real affection with which they embrace each other, and the way they delight in their unspeakable lifestyle.\n",
        "I don't know any of those [prior] versions, and I wonder how (which means I doubt that) they avoided the snare that Wharton unwittingly set for her adapters, the snare that, for all his gifts, caught Scorsese.\n",
        "Manages to be both personal and true to its source, though it never quite comes together.\n",

        "Spurning Masterpiece Theatre twittiness, Scorsese cuts to the primal passions of Wharton's tale.\n",
        "Mr. Scorsese has made a big, intelligent movie that functions as if it were a window on a world he had just discovered, and about which he can't wait to spread the news.\n",
        "Scorsese's most poignantly moving film.\n",
        "Scorsese shows he can flex an entirely different set of muscles and still make a great movie.\n",
        "Perhaps it shouldn't come as such a grand surprise that he is as deft at exploring the nuances of Edwardian manners as he is the laws of modern-day machismo.\n",
        "A sumptuous motion picture, a feast for the senses.\n",
        "Scorsese, that artist of headlong temperament, here exhibits enormous patience.\n",
        "The anarchic saga could have used more bite or the hint of a threat just to keep things interesting.\n",

        "There should have been enough material here for six sitcoms. Instead, there's not even enough for one movie.\n",
        "Fraser and Buscemi are deadpan delights. And Sandler, Opera Man on SNL, is a red-hot screen find.\n",
        "Observing how fertile the field of heavy metal music is for satire, it's disappointing to watch Airheads bumble around, desperately trying to find something funny to say.\n",
        "On the whole, Airheads is heavily entertaining.\n",
        "A spoof of heavy-metal culture that at the same time respects the vitality and pent-up passion behind it.\n",
        "Even Beavis and Butt-head get to call in their critique. Naturally, they think the Lone Rangers suck.\n",
        "Working a bit too hard to send the crowd into a frenzy, the action in this basketball-oriented yarn isn't exactly fantastic, but it is mildly entertaining.\n",
        "Give or take the odd spot of predictable arrogance, however, it's a good-humoured, good-hearted film.\n",
        "Children may find this funny, but the film isn't geared to very young audiences. It includes much more violence and profanity than its PG rating indicates.\n",
        "Like the multitude of Disney visitors to Africa before (and after) him, he must learn to respect the noble savages he wishes to exploit. Saleh and his Winabis are not for sale -- at least, not immediately.\n",

        "Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a rueful comedy about two young American women who savor many Continental delicacies.\n",
        "A bittersweet meditation on art and passion and on love in its many guises.\n",
        "As exhilarating, captivating and enjoyable as a summer romance in an exotic city.\n",
        "Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a comedy, a good one, and also one of Allen's best-ever meditations on the many entanglements of love.\n",
        "Vicky Cristina Barcelona is so engaging so much of the time that it feels like a modest rejuvenation: evidence that a summer in Spain can do wonders for a writer-director who may not have outlived his prime.\n",
        "It's literally difficult to believe that the person who made this picturesque, clueless, oddly misanthropic picture also made Annie Hall and Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n",

        "Four writers worked on the script, and they all should hang their heads in shame.\n",

        "Tomlin finds the humor and the heart in these hillbillies. The rest is just crude oil.\n",
        "Imagine the dumbest half-hour sitcom you've ever seen, spin it out to 93 minutes by making it even more thin and shallow, and you have this movie. It's appalling. It's not even really a good version of whatever it was that made the TV series appealing.\n",
        "Like the old show, the movie glides by quickly and pleasantly. If it's nothing fancy, it's mighty sweet.\n",
        "Perhaps the clearest evidence of the dearth of original ideas in Hollywood is the constant need to regurgitate old, worn-out television series.\n",

        "This hard-hitting college basketball drama marks a notable return to form for William Friedkin.\n",
        "If Mr. Friedkin didn't have to work so strenuously framing two-shots of Mr. Nolte with this seven-foot athlete, it might be hard to remember that Mr. O'Neal has a day job.\n",
        "The filmmakers don't get the ball into the Shaq-man's hands enough -- both literally and figuratively -- to make this personable giant's screen debut memorable.\n",
        "If it wasn't for some exciting roundball action, Shaquille O'Neal's hulking-dunking presence and a wonderfully guttural performance from coach Nick Nolte, you'd slither off the bench asleep.\n",
        "A rare example of an entry into this genre that attempts to be honest and unique.\n",
        "What Friedkin brings to the story is a tone that feels completely accurate; the movie is a morality play, told in the realistic, sometimes cynical terms of modern high-pressure college sports.\n",
        "Few modern-day movies are more genuinely frightening.\n",
        "This tense, offbeat piece of science-fiction is occasionally difficult to follow due to the strangeness of its scientific premise. Action nevertheless is increasingly exciting.\n",
        "Don Siegel's superb little effort, with its matter-of-fact isolation of hero Kevin McCarthy (ironic, no?) from the smarmy complacency of a small town gone to hell -- and way beyond -- points the way to his gripping action films of the 60s and 70s.\n",
        "It's still a chilling picture, gaining over Phil Kaufman's smart remake by virtue of its intimate small town setting, and it has one of the greatest endings ever filmed.\n",
        "It's probably just as well that last-minute dropouts Kim Basinger or Madonna didn't take the title role, as the presence of a star lurking powerlessly on the little platform no doubt would have been distracting and more laughable than it [is] now.\n",
        "Grotesquely misconceived.\n",

        "What Ms. Lynch has given us is a prettied-up snuff movie.\n",
        "Fenn's slow-motion fountain-bathing scene looks like an over-the-top TV commercial, the cop-out finale is a film-school cliche, and the male characters are so one-dimensional and pathetic that the movie could inspire a Men's Action Coalition.\n",

        "The never-naughty Calendar Girls is as easy to take as it is because director Nigel Cole avoids the hard sell.\n",
        "There's a terrific comedy buried somewhere here about moral hypocrisy and community panic, but it never fully emerges.\n",
        "A heartwarmer of a story.\n",
        "A charming movie.\n",
        "Pacino looks every inch a movie star, and De Palma provides a timely reminder of just how impoverished the Hollywood lexicon has become since the glory days of the '70s.\n",

        "\"Carlito's Way,\" like \"Scarface,\" is first and last a character study, a portrait of a man who wants to be better than he is.\n",
        "About halfway through, the overwhelming fact that the movie is a complete nothing becomes too much to ignore.\n",
        "Pacino has his moments but for the most part he's surprisingly underwhelming. He's a great actor but even I can do a better Puerto Rican accent.\n",
        "A competent and solidly unsurprising urban-underworld thriller: De Palma's imitation of a middle-drawer Sidney Lumet movie.\n",
        "it has truly awe-inspiring stunts and special effects and many of its suspense sequences will leave you with your heart in your mouth.\n",
        "The fact that so much money was lavished on such a thick-headed project represents the height of fiscal ineptitude, but this is the kind of roller-coaster ride for which eager audiences will gladly check their brains at the turnstiles, so go figure.\n",
        "The cinematography and gravity-defying stunt performances are exhilarating. The story, alas, is pure routine.\n",
        "Some movies get you so excited - so revved up on action and thrills -- that you almost feel like you're flying. Cliffhanger makes you feel like you're dropping.\n",
        "That rasping tension is soon smoothed away, as the plot sets off on its daft and hackneyed course.\n",
        "Cliffhanger no doubt makes for a great coming attraction, but as a two-hour movie its claims are much more problematic.\n",
        "Take away the mountains and what you have is a howlingly bad action film with a cornball villain out to steal a massive amount of United States currency from federal agents.\n",
        "Like the roller-coaster ride Cliffhanger clearly wants to be, the film sends you out pleasantly rattled and wobbly of gait.\n",
        "It's hard to think of a movie my feelings have been more divided on.\n",
        "We are not at Cliffhanger for realism; we're there for the cliffhanging, and there's plenty of it.\n",
        "Despite the don't-look-down Olympian settings, Cliffhanger's spirit is brutal and earthbound. The movie is like one of those computer-designed simulator rides that whip you around until you're dizzy and aching but don't actually take you anywhere.\n",
        "Cliffhanger lives up to its title as a two-hour rollercoaster ride that never stops.\n",
        "Fun for the undemanding, but Stallone's 'comeback' should have been much tighter.\n",
        "Cliffhanger, the new high-altitude thriller starring Sylvester Stallone, wastes no time in establishing its first priority, that of sending its audience into a cold sweat.\n",
        "Cliffhanger is a device to entertain us, and it works, especially during those moments when Stallone is hanging by his fingernails over a three-mile fall, and the bad guys are stomping on him.\n",
        "A predictably thick-headed, occasionally plodding bacchanalia of blood, grunts and testosterone.\n",
        "Whether Cliffhanger will bring Stallone's name back into the top echelon of action movie stars has yet to be determined, but if this film can't, the task may be impossible.\n",
        "Just pull the plug on your judgment, good sense and values. Remember to leave enough motor skills to face forward -- that's where the screen is.\n",
        "The killer may find his target, but Color of Night fails to hit the nail on the head by a frustrating margin.\n",
        "I'm tempted to go ahead and explain just exactly how transparent -- and implausible -- this mystery is. But then I don't want to spoil it for people who are even worse than I am at this sort of thing. People like Forrest Gump.\n",
        "Mundane sex scenes, a standard L.A. car chase and Bakula's outrageously gory death scene (which plays like an unintentional parody) are all part of the predictable script.\n",
        "The plot gets so convoluted and farfetched that you still may be scratching your head after the denouement, but you probably won't be bored.\n",
        "It's a psycho-erotic thriller with more twists and shocks than the rattlesnake which, at one point, leaps out at star Bruce Willis-from a location we won't describe. (It would spoil one of the several dozen surprises.)\n",
        "Color of Night and North represent the nadir of Willis' plummeting film career. He can be a most engaging talent; his script selection of late has been awful.\n",
        "A deliriously brain-dead erotic thriller.\n",
        "Color of Night is a knuckleheaded thriller that means to get a rise out of audiences but will merely make them see red.\n",
        "This -- another of Willis's crimes against celluloid -- is a special kind of bad.\n",
        "The enthusiastically nutty Color of Night has the single-mindedness of a bad dream, and about as much reliance on everyday logic.\n",
        "Where's John McClane when you need him? If nothing else, the main character from the two Die Hard films would have livened up proceedings in this pathetically inept psychological thriller.\n",
        "A clunker ripe for hecklers and oglers.\n",
        "A convoluted psychosexual thriller that promises the moon and gives us Bruce's butt.\n",
        "Color of Night approaches badness from so many directions that one really must admire its imagination.\n",
        "Trapped in a sitcom sensibility, the film never makes the vital connection with the audience that's necessary to spawn a hit.\n",
        "Chevy Chase returns to the anonymous, unmemorable suburban mode that made his earlier movies profitable. And guess what? The results are anonymous and unmemorable.\n",
        "In Cops and Robbersons, Chevy Chase has an unfortunate chance to prove that there's something even more unfunny than his disastrous talk show.\n",
        "Chevy Chase is lucky Cops and Robbersons isn't a sitcom. If it were, it would be canceled as pronto as his talk show was.\n",
        "Know what this sounds like? It sounds like a screenplay.\n",
        "A genial, expertly played political comedy proves that the spirit of Mr. Smith still lives.\n",
        "It's impossible to say whether Dave will play as wonderfully over the decades as it does right now, but this smooth-as-silk comedy could not be more timely, or connect more hopefully with our current national consciousness.\n",
        "While it's sloppy and draggy in parts, Kevin Kline, in the title role, delivers an ingratiating comedic performance.\n",
        "Kline is so polished and resourceful that he can glide his way through even the creakiest bits and make them seem fresh.\n",
        "Though replete with amusing situations and clever lines, its strongest suit is the delicately pitched comic performances of its actors, most especially star Kevin Kline.\n",
        "After the promisingly nasty beginning, the filmmakers settle into a sort of campaign mode, lulling and flattering the audience with a fairy-tale vision of the common man's victory over the Washington establishment.\n",
        "Dave has been directed by Ivan Reitman in a refreshingly restrained fashion -- there are plenty of quiet passages, rare for American movies these days -- which compliments Kevin Kline's wonderful work as well.\n",
        "It's a beautifully proportioned, wonderfully complete movie.\n",
        "For all its modest charm, Dave is a true throwback to the Capra days, a political comedy just cockeyed enough to triumph over cynicism.\n",
        "An overall mood of sweetness may help one to forgive the archaic and childish aspects of the would-be analysis, which splits everyone between angels and devils.\n",
        "A buoyant comedy in the Capra tradition.\n",
        "In spite of this sogginess, and despite a self-congratulatory, do-gooder streak that the film discovers within Dave, this comedy remains bright and buoyant much of the way through.\n",
        "[Mixes] comedy and corn with surprising savvy.\n",
        "A delightful, buoyant new take on an old theme.\n",
        "A highly-enjoyable, fresh, and energetic motion picture that even the most hard-bitten cynic will be hard-pressed to condemn.\n",
        "Offers feel-good guffaws.\n",
        "Will hit the warm, gushy spot for a lot of people.\n",
        "Wonderful lighthearted entertainment.\n",
        "The teenage wasteland, 1976-style, of Dazed and Confused is smack-dab between The Brady Bunch and Children of the Damned , and it's a scary, if sometimes giddily amusing, place to visit.\n",
        "Bet it makes you wanna dance.\n",
        "Seriously funny, and shorn of any hint of nostalgia or wish-fulfilment, this is pretty much where it's at.\n",
        "A better-than-average teen movie but not much more, at least if you aren't a member of Linklater's generation.\n",
        "Seriously funny, and shorn of any hint of nostalgia or wish-fulfilment, this is pretty much where it's at.\n",
        "Dazed and Confused has an enjoyably playful spirit, one that amply compensates for its lack of structure.\n",
        "The ultimate party movie -- loud, crude, socially irresponsible and totally irresistible.\n",
        "Succeeds on its own terms and reflects American culture so well, it becomes part of it.\n",
        "This is light entertainment -- nothing groundbreaking or even especially noteworthy.\n",
        "The film's real inspiration, I think, is to depict some high school kids from the 1970s with such unblinking attention that we will realize how romanticized most movie teenagers are.\n",
        "Once every decade or so, a movie captures the hormone-drenched, fashion- crazed, pop-song-driven rituals of American youth culture with such loving authenticity that it comes to seem a kind of anthem.\n",
        "Ultimately the script's often sharp social satire is drowned out by the noise and confusion. It is also undercut by casting virtually all the psychopathically murderous criminals as minority-group members.\n",
        "Nearly all the SF premises are accorded the status of Andrew Dice Clay one-liners -- which means that they, along with the characters, keep changing from one scene to the next.\n",
        "A noisy, soulless, self-conscious pastiche that mixes elements of sci-fi, action-adventure and romance, then pours on a layer of comedy replete with Hollywood in-jokes.\n",
        "Forget your preconceptions, but not your brain cells and sense of irony.\n",
        "Demolition Man is a significant artifact of our time or, at least, of this week.\n",
        "Demolition Man is sleek and empty as well as brutal and pointless. It feels computer engineered, untouched by human hands. A real pod movie.\n",
        "In the end, that's all this film is: flames, flying bullets, and special effects. It could be worse, I suppose, but as long as people go into this film with their eyes open, there shouldn't be any surprises.\n",
        "Basically, Demolition Man is a futuristic cop picture with slightly more imagination and wit than the typical example of the slash-and-burn genre.\n",
        "Not as exciting as the first film, this one can't decide whether it's a tarvelogue, an adventure, or National Geographic documentary.\n",
        "Had The Endless Summer II stuck to its subject, it would be a pleasant diversion. But it is weighed down with frivolous travel vignettes that are as dull as they are cute and contrived.\n",
        "Pretty hard to sit through, because Brown's incessant beach boy prattle is endlessly irritating.\n",
        "Although the movie runs 95 minutes, it contains nothing much in the way of information about surfing.\n",
        "One of those rare bits of movie marginalia that are entirely without merit and, still, a pleasure to sit through.\n",
        "There are just too many half-cooked ingredients in this utopian stew of a movie.\n",
        "The filmmakers have provided critics ample artillery by prominently featuring a skunk in this thuddingly flat spoof of erotic thrillers.\n",
        "It's a real pity, because Reiner has certainly been funnier and more inventive on other outings and Sherilyn Fenn makes a winsome gal Friday.\n",
        "A collection of gags that vary much too wildly in terms of timing and wit.\n",
        "Small jokes are buried under elaborate setups. Sight gags are repeated to the point of exhaustion.\n",
        "Maybe you'll be in the right mood and like this stuff. It looks good, and the actors are several notches above the usual parody cast in ability. And yet...\n",
        "Lacking in both inspiration and ingenuity, it doesn't so much spoof the conventions of the genre as dumb down famous -- and in some cases, forgotten -- scenes from a slew of other movies.\n",
        "If I see another send-up of Sharon Stone's character in Basic Instinct, I think I'll walk out of the theater.\n",
        "The scenes in the Peking Opera School, where boys are caned for doing wrong or right, are no less horrifying than the later tableaus of public humiliation at the hands of the Maoists.\n",
        "This is entertaining filmmaking on a grand scale.\n",
        "Seductively lensed but emotionally uninvolving.\n",
        "Chen's remarkable movie uses an unusual love triangle to telescope more than 50 years of tumultuous Chinese history.\n",
        "Appropriately operatic, Chen's visually spectacular epic is sumptuous in every respect. Intelligent, enthralling, rhapsodic.\n",
        "One of those very rare film spectacles that deliver just about everything the ads are likely to promise.\n",
        "The film flows with such urgency that all its connections seem logical. And it is filmed with such visual splendor that possible objections are swept aside.\n",
        "Like Cheung's ethereally plaintive voice, the movie is a siren song that's appealing at first, but held too long. It becomes an increasing whine.\n",
        "The director carries us through this early history with impressive sensitivity; he has a beautiful, graceful touch, both with the camera and with his actors.\n",
        "A motion picture experience that few will soon forget after leaving the theater.\n",
        "The best hip-hop film of all.\n",
        "Inspired by This Is Spinal Tap, this mockumentary exposes the trials of a hardcore rap band, N.W.H. (Niggas With Hats) with wild, irreverent humor and exuberant music.\n",
        "While individual interviews, pop-video parodies and album titles hit the mark, the film as a whole is insufficiently clear-cut in its satire of the bands' dubious antics and attitudes.\n",
        "If Mr. Cundieff doesn't match the satirical genius of Mr. Reiner's film, he does understand the rules of the game.\n",
        "Not as fearless and sharp-edged as it could be -- but it provides a lot of laughs, and barbecues a few sacred cows.\n",
        "This movie is not tightly-scripted or elegantly produced, but it is (for the most part) highly entertaining. For those who have been waiting for a sequel to Spinal Tap, this may be the best alternative.\n",
        "As it recounts the history of N.W.H., the film also manages to lampoon rap music and its archetypes, as well as poking fun at the venal, self-serving music-business types looking to grab easy money from the scene.\n",
        "Fear of a Black Hat is not brilliant, but it's bright enough.\n",
        "Tom Cruise heads a tony cast in a best-seller movie that is firm at the start and infirm by the end.\n",
        "The Firm amusingly satirizes the New Traditionalist aspirations of today's young urban elite -- not so much the lifestyle itself as the illusion of utter security it represents.\n",
        "A smooth adaptation of John Grisham's giant bestseller that is destined to be one of the summer's strong audience pleasers.\n",
        "Adorning the film, in supporting roles, are its saving graces.\n",
        "The movie is extremely long (two hours and 34 minutes) and so slow that by the end you feel as if you've been standing up even if you've been sitting down.\n",
        "The book moved at turbo speed. At two and a half hours, the movie crawls.\n",
        "With a screenplay that developed the story more clearly, this might have been a superior movie, instead of just a good one with some fine performances.\n",
        "Pollack makes a solid job of it, as does Cruise. But solid isn't enough when it comes to thrillers -- or courtroom dramas, for that matter. Solid is great when it comes to office furniture.\n",
        "Cruise was born to play company man, and the role is an opportunity to sum up his old roles and transcend them with his most potently emotional work.\n",
        "Very little of what made the written version so enjoyable has been successfully translated to the screen, and what we're left with instead is an overly-long (two hours and thirty-four minutes, to be exact), pedantic thriller.\n",
        "The film is little more than a well-oiled machine that serves a strictly limited function, but like a precision timepiece, it is a thing to marvel at, even under close scrutiny.\n",
        "For dynamite suspense loaded with thrills and wicked fun, you can't beat The Fugitive.\n",
        "I've already seen The Fugitive twice. I'll probably see it again.\n",
        "Thoroughly engaging, edge-of-the-seat entertainment.\n",
        "While there are actors in this film, there isn't much room for acting. The rapid editing and near-absence of dialogue reduces the actors to action figures with colorful labels pasted on their foreheads.\n",
        "The Fugitive is a super-adrenalized stemwinder, a crisp and jolting melodrama that screws the tension so pitilessly tight it does everything but squeak.\n",
        "It's a pleasure to find a thriller fulfilling its duties with such gusto: the emotions ring solid, the script finds time to relax into backchat, and for once the stunts look like acts of desperation rather than shows of prowess.\n",
        "It isn't just a high-powered summer blockbuster. It's something cannier (and rarer): a suspense thriller rooted in character.\n",
        "A first-rate thriller.\n",
        "A consummate nail-biter that never lags, it leaves you breathless from the chase yet anxious for the next bit of mayhem or clever plot twist.\n",
        "Though it's a good half hour too long, this overblown 1993 spin-off of the 60s TV show otherwise adds up to a pretty good suspense thriller.\n",
        "A glossy, formula chase movie with the requisite number of extravagant action sequences (most notably a massive train crash).\n",
        "Both stars have toughness and restraint that make their characters' battle of wits truly hypnotic, and in many ways more credible than it was on television.\n",
        "A juggernaut of exaggeration, momentum and thrills.\n",
        "\"Innovative\" is not a legitimate description of The Fugitive, but \"entertaining\" is.\n",
        "Davis paints with bold visual strokes so that the movie rises above its action-film origins and becomes operatic.\n",
        "A flurry of stunts, close shaves and deeds of desperate daring, it easily transcends its television origins to become a stylish pacemaker-buster on the order of \"Die Hard, MD.\"\n",
        "A film of great beauty and considerable intelligence.\n",
        "A big-reveal thriller with surprises that really do surprise -- and are worth waiting for through an audaciously long buildup.\n",
        "Writer-director David Twohy (Pitch Black) serves up mechanical thrills culminating in a bogus twist ending\n",
        "A Perfect Getaway is a little better -- well, a little stranger -- than most of the disposables this summer.\n",
        "David Twohy's taut, palm-sweating thriller has two things going for it: it keeps you guessing and it doesn't insult your intelligence.\n",
        "The aesthetic is closer to a grand finale of Survivor than anything else, and while all the actors do scrappy work, they don't have much psychology to play with -- unlike a fun, class-conscious wilderness tale like The Edge.\n",
        "I just don't think there was enough drama in the first two-thirds of this movie.\n",
        "A terrific twist, but goes wasted in a movie that really runs out of steam.\n",
        "A Perfect Getaway is the rarest of film treats -- a B-movie that knows where it's going and how to get there.\n",
        "Twohy serves up a hard-to-swallow second-act twist and an unconvincing back story, but the slightly overlong A Perfect Getaway recovers with a pulse-pounding climax.\n",
        "The result isn't deadly dull, but it does turn what should have been a most dangerous game into a basic scenery-chewing contest.\n",
        "A Perfect Getaway is one of those very clever whodunits that keeps you guessing for quite awhile. But on the way home, as you replay its tricks, you may feel more conned than charmed.\n",
        "Twohy correctly banks on the fact that his audience will be too busy sifting through those aforementioned \"red snappers\" to care about the details.\n",
        "For a low-brow, psycho-on-the-loose-in-paradise thriller, A Perfect Getaway is surprisingly entertaining, with exactly the right elements to overcome the inevitable cliches.\n",
        "A gimmicky, tricked-out tale that is all too self-aware. But the film does keep you guessing and probably guessing wrong.\n",
        "Viewers know the gotcha is coming not only because they've been groomed to expect a third-act left turn in movies like this, but because the film's characters won't stop talking about it.\n",
        "A Perfect Getaway is a clever, heart-pounding thriller, and a welcome return to form for the director.\n",
        "What is surprising about this effective little thriller is how cleverly writer-director David Twohy toys with the conventions of the genre as they exist today.\n",
        "David Twohy doesn't do much new and the twist is as obvious as a tornado in the Texas Panhandle. But that doesn't make it any less of an escapist joyride on a hot summer day.\n",
        "The new summer movies don't get much more formulaic than this bald attempt to capture the audience that can't wait to see the next three or four installments of Home Alone.\n",
        "This seems to be the work not of screenwriters but of Hollywood marketing executives who believe movies are popular because they tell audiences what they want to hear.\n",
        "It's all a bit smug and suspect.\n",
        "Tone: Home Alone-style slapstick with occasional (almost random) heart-tugging.\n",
        "Neither Macaulay Culkin nor Ted Danson has improved his luck in selecting projects with this schizophrenic comedy.\n",
        "The script is formula and so is the direction, which leaves the acting.\n",
        "Perhaps blackmail isn't an easy subject to warm up to, or robbery the best ground to rebuild a relationship on, but with a little care, some added ingredients and a bit more spice, Getting Even With Dad could have been a satisfying [film].\n",
        "Here is a movie with broad ambitions: It wants to be a caper, a comedy, a romance, and a showcase for MacAulay Culkin. That's too much of a stretch.\n",
        "It's so monotonously unimaginative that it practically qualifies as child abuse.\n",
        "The dysfunctional family in this film is little more than a shameless plot device to introduce a lame father/son bonding adventure.\n",
        "Who, exactly, is supposed to fall for this stuff?\n",
        "It probably sounded terrific in the pitch meeting.\n",
        "The most significant lesbian film of the past 20 years, this comedy is refreshingly not about coming out--it challenges prevalent stereotypes about lesbians without the stiff and sanctimonious tone of films like Claire of the Moon.\n",
        "Mr. Stone tells this tale vigorously, but he has the wrong cinematic vocabulary for his heroine's essentially passive experience.\n",
        "Heaven has so many themes, ranging from Buddhist spirituality to feminism, it ends up with none.\n",
        "This is the first time [Stone] has tried to place himself inside a woman's imagination, and that he succeeds so well is due partly...to an extraordinary performance by Hiep Thi Le in the leading role.\n",
        "Heaven and Earth has the epic scope one would expect from a film of this magnitude, but it lacks much of the narrative strength of Stone's first two Vietnamese tales.\n",
        "This is a long way from the inspirations of Airplane!\n",
        "Unlike its grim predecessor, there are at least two chuckles this time round.\n",
        "Is nothing sacred to the makers of Hot Shots! Part Deux? Nope. Not a thing.\n",
        "God help me, I laughed and slapped my thighs.\n",
        "One of the pleasures of watching a spoof like this is to spot the references; it's like a quiz on pop art.\n",
        "There are many instances when the film is too obvious in its attempts at humor.\n",
        "Though there's nothing in the film to equal the excitement of seeing a marquee collapse from the weight of its title, an attractive cast and setting turn a tired one-joke premise into an adequate view.\n",
        "If Shore's comic genius eludes you or if you find the film something less than a constant laugh riot, you may still be willing to agree that it's amiable enough and not begrudge in the least the likelihood that Shore fans will be pleased.\n",
        "Is In the Army Now funny? Yes, Drill Sergeant, Sir! Is it stupid? Yes, sir! Does it kill brain cells? Yes, sirree!\n",
        "Being an appealing, shallow goof-off can wear thin, and Shore seems incapable of carrying a movie, even when it's a 90-minute knock-off like this.\n",
        "The movie's best performance is given by a camel.\n",
        "[An] abysmal knockoff of Stripes.\n",
        "Putting Mr. Shore under the authority of a pretty female drill sergeant (Lynn Whitfield) is, along with that bad haircut, one of this film's only ways of getting laughs.\n",
        "Every promising situation -- Shore suffering through basic training, dealing with real battle and so on -- suffers immediate creative fatigue.\n",
        "It's a tale as old as the jokes, which were already old when the Peloponnesians went to war.\n",
        "The screenplay, work by five writers, based on a story by three others, seems to have been rewritten often enough that any individuality has been lost.\n",
        "Daniel Day-Lewis is remarkable.\n",
        "In the Name of the Father is a model of this kind of engaged, enraged filmmaking, a politically charged Fugitive that uses one of the most celebrated cases of recent British history to steamroller an audience with the power of rousing, polemical cinema.\n",
        "At every point, Day-Lewis is at the center of the story, and he carries the film with an impassioned performance. It helps that it's a great part.\n",
        "The picture turns into a kind of stylized morality play about the right and the wrong ways for Irishmen to respond to distorted portraits of their character, and it's terrifically effective.\n",
        "Day-Lewis, so intricately repressed in The Age of Innocence, here offers a role reversal in an unreserved and emotional performance that throws caution and inhibition to the winds.\n",
        "The complicated relationship between the rebellious Gerry and the quietly tormented Giuseppe is one focus of the film. The obvious political implications of the dreadful situation are another.\n",
        "By the end of the movie, whether or not you're a member of Sinn Fein, the Brits' brutality toward the Conlons will get your Irish up.\n",
        "[Sheridan] works with such piercing fervor and intelligence that In the Name of the Father just about transcends its tidy moral design.\n",
        "Miscarried justice often provides the vehicle for emotionally wrenching drama and histrionic fireworks, and such is the case in spades with In the Name of the Father.\n",
        "The acting's so good it frequently transcends the simplicities of the script, and whenever Day-Lewis or Postlethwaite is on-screen the movie crackles.\n",
        "Sheridan's movie seeks to engage and enrage. It's not, however, a film with an ideological axe to sharpen, but one which unfolds, with a sense of passionate conviction, a story of injustice.\n",
        "The film offers layers of dramatic detail for those who might be confused at points but teased to inquire further.\n",
        "[Day-Lewis] proves here once again that he is one of the most talented and interesting actors of his generation.\n",
        "As good a compromise of fact and fiction as you could hope for -- and still call it a movie.\n",
        "The brilliance of Jim Sheridan's motion picture is that we come to view every event from the perspective of how it impacts on the relationship between Gerry and his father, in whose name the final struggle is fought.\n",
        "The film takes forever to do what 60 Minutes does with the same meat in a single segment.\n",
        "A powerful portrait of emotional endurance, propelled by the outstanding performances of Bassett and Fishburne, both of whom lend a crucial dimension to the gradual redundancies of Kate Lanier's otherwise insightful screenplay.\n",
        "Their nuanced performances give a spectrum of emotional shadings to a black-and-white script that casts Tina as the Beauty to Ike's unreconstructed Beast.\n",
        "Angela Bassett is a wonderfully sympathetic screen presence who may have a big career ahead of her.\n",
        "Fishburne's astonishing portrayal of Ike is what holds the movie together. The actor builds, in precise increments, a devastating portrait of a macho control freak; he even finds a kind of ghastly humor in the character's madness.\n",
        "Though the picture rightfully belongs to Bassett, a final word must be said about Fishburne, who never fails to make Ike seem human if not defensible. Even in defeat, he is remarkably compelling.\n",
        "Brian Gibson, who directed the script by Kate Lanier, seems to have trouble taking charge of his material as he skips through the years.\n",
        "A powerful, joyful, raw, energetically acted bio-pic detailing the joys and pain of the on- and offstage lives of blues rockers Ike and Tina Turner.\n",
        "As a powerhouse showcase for the acting talents of Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne and as a potent portrayal of wife beating and the emotions that surround it, it's quite a show.\n",
        "A splashy, volatile, crowd- pleasing rock-star melodrama that makes up in sheer emotional wallop what it sometimes lacks in finesse.\n",
        "A passionate personal and professional drama that hits both the high and low notes of an extraordinary career.\n",
        "Angela Bassett shakes her tail feather with aplomb and pins down the singer's gestures with amazing precision. Top honours, however, belong to Fishburne's swaggering, savage portrayal of Ike.\n",
        "The brilliant, mercurial portrayal of Ike Turner by Laurence Fishburne is what elevates What's Love Got to Do With It beyond the realm of run-of-the-mill biography.\n",
        "A handsome woman with the lanky appeal of Katharine Hepburn, Bassett brays and bruises with equal effectiveness.\n",
        "It's a story of pain and courage, uncommonly honest and unflinching, and the next time I hear Tina Turner singing I will listen to the song in a whole new way.\n",
        "You don't have to be a Tina Turner fan to appreciate this movie, but, regardless of your opinion of her music, What's Love Got To Do With It cannot fail to impart an impression of her courage and inner strength.\n",
        "A melodrama of starry-eyed love and black-eyed beatings, exhausting road tours and the singer's even harder road to self-realization, the movie contains its emotional highs and lows in the hermetically sealed bio-pic format.\n",
        "This is an exceedingly well directed, cleverly filmed and edited, tension-filled affair. It is also a wholly preposterous, muddled, paranoid view of the inner-city nightmare where the slightest misstep is sure to have a fateful result.\n",
        "A tight, energetic sleeper in the action-adventure genre, manages to pack a few anti-machismo sentiments into an otherwise brawny tale.\n",
        "The filmmakers have made a big deal of a soundtrack that features 10 collaborations between rappers and rockers (the theme is performed by De La Soul and Teenage Fan Club), but their casting consciousness is less adventurous.\n",
        "It's refreshing to know that it's not just characters in horror films who are irredeemably dumb.\n",
        "Perhaps the ultimate Judgment comes from Estevez, who observes: 'Nothing about tonight makes sense.'\n",
        "Jurassic Park is an astonishing success in one sense and one sense only: It is the monster of all monster movies, guaranteed to challenge weak bladders, flutter heartbeats and win automatic Oscars for the [tech crew].\n",
        "The enthralling man-vs.-nature parable based on the late Michael Crichton's best-selling novel hasn't aged one bit.\n",
        "The 3-D process adds not just dimension but depth - a technological extension of cinematographer Gregg Toland's deep-focus innovations in The Grapes of Wrath and Citizen Kane. The change in perspective creates greater intensity.\n",
        "I'm a fan of this movie. It is thrilling, and the 3-D treatment is a nice enhancement.\n",
        "This movie doesn't just stand the test of time, it transcends it.\n",
        "\"Jurassic Park\" remains an absolute thrill from a Spielberg in top form: Funny, scary, fast-moving and full of just-right details.\n",
        "\"Jurassic Park\" was impressive in 1993. Twenty years later, it's flawless.\n",
        "Spielberg has gone on to weightier and more prestigious projects, but this thrill ride is one of his best and a masterpiece of the genre.\n",
        "That T. rex is worth the wait, but the wait itself is even more memorable.\n",
        "For all the ingenuity of the movie's engineering, Jurassic Park doesn't have the imagination -- or the courage -- to take us any place we haven't been a thousand times before. It's just a creature feature on amphetamines.\n",
        "Do the dinosaurs work? Indeed they do. Does anything else? Not really.\n",
        "The earthshaking footfalls of these lizard-kings are palpable and terrifying. Spielberg's crew of dinosaur-effects artists has conjured up a Mesozoic menagerie whose realism outdoes anything in cinema history.\n",
        "This is as close as any of us is likely to get to witnessing life in prehistoric times.\n",
        "The characters aren't much more well-defined than the anonymous victims of a teen horror movie... The dinosaur effects, however, are absolutely stunning, and sometimes so natural that one even forgets to be impressed.\n",
        "Spielberg's peerless twin gift has always been for making the fantastic seem real (Close Encounters, E.T., the Indiana Jones trilogy) and the real fantastic (Jaws).\n",
        "The well-selected cast is winningly sympathetic and entertainingly idiosyncratic.\n",
        "There's more soul to be found in any Kong close-up than in this film's overplayed reactions.\n",
        "Spielberg is still supreme as an action director, and when the T Rex makes beefburger of the jeep, or the vicious 'Raptors stalk their human prey, the film inspires wonder and awe.\n",
        "You won't believe your eyes.\n",
        "Mr. Spielberg has great fun with every last growl and rumble signaling the approach of danger...\n",
        "The film does a lovely job of juxtaposing the sharp contrasts in Aaron's life, and in marveling at the fact that he survives as buoyantly as he does.\n",
        "A remarkable odyssey about a resilient young hero who uses both his imagination and his sense of reality to survive.\n",
        "With the kind of material you'd never dream of associating with him, Soderbergh has made his best film.\n",
        "It's his best work by far.\n",
        "The slow-paced King of the Hill is a feel-good fable in which it's difficult to work up any worry over a boy with clearly unsinkable spirits.\n",
        "What makes \"Lassie\" work is the craftsmanship and thoughtfulness that director Petrie and his creative team bring to the task.\n",
        "A stubbornly sweet, picturesque children's film ...\n",
        "It's somehow reassuring, these days, to see a movie where there's no problem Lassie can't solve.\n",
        "For better or worse, \"Lassie\" is as safe and square as the TV show of yesteryear.\n",
        "The story may be predictable, ham-fisted and saccharine, but that's why kids (and softhearted parents) will like it.\n",
        "A remarkably clean, bracing production that does a difficult thing exceptionally well, depicting believably modern young people in a believably old-fashioned plot.\n",
        "There is a lot of action in Last Action Hero, but the underlying story never ever quite works.\n",
        "The pulse-pounding, sizzling pull of a Die Hard is absent.\n",
        "Even if this intermixing of kid fantasy and adult shoot'em-up, Hollywood insider jokes and cheap Arnold puns, doesn't completely bowl you over, it's clever and intriguing.\n",
        "Feels like a farewell, of sorts, to Arnold.\n",
        "A good-natured, if laconic, oater that rides along nicely on the screen persona of writer/actor Paul Hogan.\n",
        "The film has no internal comic rhythm to match its faltering sense of humor. Much of the time, it plods along like a mediocre conventional western.\n",
        "Lightning Jack feels like a film you might stumble across late at night on the USA Network.\n",
        "It's impossible to dislike Paul Hogan, and almost as hard to like his movies. They're as goodhearted as they are simple-minded.\n",
        "Hogan should hang up his spurs until a truly original impulse comes along.\n",
        "Nobody labors quite like Woody Allen to produce a modest entertainment.\n",
        "A movie inspired by movie escapism. Minor, but surprisingly, almost defiantly upbeat.\n",
        "Although \"Manhattan Murder Mystery\" struggles with its own contrivances, it achieves a gentle, nostalgic grace and a hint of un-self-conscious wisdom.\n",
        "That Woody Allen found time to be remotely funny -- in the midst of his highly publicized legal troubles -- surely merits some kind of professional award.\n",
        "\"Manhattan Murder Mystery\" is an accomplished balancing act.\n",
        "Happily, these two stir up stardust memories of his earlier, funnier work, instead of the embarrassing voyeurism of \"Husbands and Wives.\"\n",
        "Don't let the silly styling of the title put you off; this is a powerful, convincing, and terrifying look at teenage crime in contemporary Watts.\n",
        "Bleak, brilliant, and unsparing: a full-scale vision of the madness that is tearing up the black inner city.\n",
        "Fierce, violent and searing in its observation, the film makes previous excursions seem like a stroll through the park.\n",
        "Regrettably, the Hughes brothers' first feature is a compendium of cliches.\n",
        "If Menace II Society is terrific on ambiance, it is considerably less successful in revealing character.\n",
        "Nothing the Hughes brothers have done in their videos for Tone Loc, Tupac Shakur and others prepares you for the controlled intensity and maturity they bring to their stunning feature debut.\n",
        "Anyone who views this film thoughtfully must ask why our society makes guns easier to obtain and use than does any other country in the civilized world. And that is only the most obvious of the many questions the film inspires.\n",
        "It's maddening and enlivening. It's brilliant and tacky. It's funny and horrifying. It will gratify the worst elements in the crowd; it will engage the very best.\n",
        "It won't be a fun time -- at least not in the conventional sense -- but you'll sit through a ninety-seven minute odyssey that won't be quickly forgotten.\n",
        "A spirited, winningly acted rendition of one of the Bard's most popular comedies.\n",
        "[Branagh] has found his way to the play's profound yet populist heart, rediscovering Shakespeare's vision of romantic fulfillment - celebration with an underlying tug of sadness - for an era that believes itself all too wise to the ways of love.\n",
        "Continuously enjoyable from its action-filled opening to the dazzling final shot...\n",
        "There's much to commend in Branagh's pruned, international version of Shakespeare's troubling comedy.\n",
        "Kenneth Branagh...has done it again.\n",
        "The picture is overripe, and with few exceptions, so are the performances.\n",
        "The key to the film's success is in the acting, especially in the sparks that fly between Branagh and Thompson.\n",
        "Somehow, the movie feels insubstantial and uninspired.\n",
        "Director Branagh, who altered the play imaginatively for the screen, gives wonderful import to this silliness from long ago.\n",
        "This film cements Branagh's status as a great director of Shakespeare, and perhaps of film in general, as well.\n",
        "Short on laughs but tinged with a pleasant European flavor.\n",
        "Writer/director Minghella's second feature brings ambivalence and a touch of realpolitik to the stuff of candyfloss romance.\n",
        "Without that yeoman cast effort and Dillon's easy charm, Mr. Wonderful could easily be mistaken for Mr. Potatohead.\n",
        "One of those films where it's clear to the audience within five minutes what must obviously happen, and clear to the characters only at the end of the story.\n",
        "Mr. Wonderful doesn't aspire to be anything more than it is, and such a simple, uncomplicated presentation, coupled with likable characters, makes this film a fine example of light, romantic entertainment.\n",
        "Although overly sappy in places and probably 20 minutes too long, this Robin Williams-in-drag vehicle provides the comic a slick surface for doing his shtick, within a story possessing broad family appeal.\n",
        "I've rarely laughed so much at a movie I generally disliked.\n",
        "Sit-com stuff, then, with laboured farcical interludes, and a mushy post-feminist sensibility. Funny notwithstanding.\n",
        "The dress, the mask and Mrs. Doubtfire's gentility are inherently limiting, but nothing holds Mr. Williams back when he's on a roll.\n",
        "In terms of plot, the film is rather feeble, but sometimes there's more to a movie than story, and this is one of those rare occasions when all the other elements pull together and lift the production.\n",
        "Williams has to break out of a second-rate \"Tootsie\" imitation, ankles clamped in pathos and face covered in latex. He pulls it off in the end, but it's not pretty.\n",
        "You will laugh till your ribs ache -- not because director Chris Columbus of the \"Home Alone\" movies has a gift for farce, which he does, but because Williams is to funny what the Energizer Bunny is to batteries. He keeps going and going and going.\n",
        "The film is not as amusing as the premise, and there were long stretches when I'd had quite enough of Mrs. Doubtfire.\n",
        "As immersive and well-acted as any character study Leigh's done, but ultimately numbing in its insistence on focusing on this would-be world-wary philosopher.\n",
        "The Next Karate Kid is harmless as children's entertainment, but for 104 very long minutes, there isn't a recognizable human being in sight.\n",
        "The overt message of any Karate Kid movie: Don't fight unless you absolutely have to. The implicit message: You'll always have to. Let the smitings begin!\n",
        "While the message that a girl can defend herself against the boys threatening her is a good one, it's lost in a movie where the bullies look like Mussolini's bodyguards and where Julie waits for her boyfriend and Miyagi to come to her defense.\n",
        "Only the reasonably-appealing performances of Morita and newcomer Swank keep it all from becoming even more of a loser.\n",
        "Not that girls will go see this or boys will care.\n",
        "The franchise is still kicking -- but not very high.\n",
        "[It] may be the silliest episode yet in the popular Karate Kid series.\n",
        "What is the sound of one hand clapping? The audience giving it up for The Next Karate Kid.\n",
        "A sometimes smart social commentary on Los Angeles characters who seek spiritual salvation when they can't buy every object they want.\n",
        "The amalgams of TV stereotypes that satirize foreign and regional cultures are embarrassing.\n",
        "It's a prime example of what can happen when hip, slightly cynical establishment filmmakers try to make a deeply sentimental movie.\n",
        "How could director Rob Reiner, whose touch for what pleases a mass audience is usually unfailing, have strayed this far?\n",
        "The intrinsic failure of Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman's script is that it tips its hand from the start.\n",
        "Reiner is undecided just how fantastically he should treat this ludicrous plotline. Added to which there's a dire musical number, a silly thriller subplot, and much maudlin didacticism from narrator Willis in various guardian angel (dis)guises. Misery.\n",
        "North, a playful modern fable about a boy in search of new parents, doesn't always work, but much of it is clever in amusingly unpredictable ways.\n",
        "North seldom raises more than a chuckle.\n",
        "The premise of North sounds flat, the previews look insipid, and, while the movie doesn't turn out nearly as bad as either would lead you to believe, North is still a lackluster production.\n",
        "This movie is aimed at neither kids nor adults; it simply isn't aimed.\n",
        "I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it.\n",
        "It's strange and oddly distasteful, at its best managing to be bad in some original and unexpected ways.\n",
        "It's depressing enough to see a director turn into a button pusher. But what can you say about a director who just keeps hitting the same button?\n",
        "Swinton's androgynous affect has rarely been better exploited: It's a kick to see her transition among Orlando's numerous identities, whether wooing a Russian princess or submitting to the charms of the horseback-riding Shelmerdine.\n",
        "This is the kind of movie you want to talk about afterward.\n",
        "In going beyond chase-yarn duty, Eastwood and Costner do themselves proud.\n",
        "A Perfect World is evidence that Hollywood is still capable of producing the kinds of moving, intelligent movies that have increasingly become the province of independent film makers.\n",
        "This is a movie that surprises you.\n",
        "Within its narrow, unambitious, commercial boundaries, the movie is highly watchable.\n",
        "Sweetie and An Angel at My Table have taught us to expect startling as well as beautiful things from Jane Campion, and this assured and provocative third feature (1993) offers yet another lush parable.\n",
        "Campion never underestimates the power physical obsession exerts over human souls, and, for once, a modern film treats erotic passion honestly.\n",
        "Ms. Campion somehow suggests states of mind you've never before recognized on the screen.\n",
        "[An] evocative, powerful, extraordinarily beautiful film from the Australian director Jane Campion.\n",
        "The Piano is as peculiar and haunting as any film I've seen.\n",
        "The Piano plays itself with such contrapuntal richness, it resonates in you forever.\n",
        "The Piano is a solid motion picture with a universal message and occasional splashes of genius, but it is remarkable only as Holly Hunter's performance is concerned.\n",
        "Only the most undiscriminating monster-pic buff will come away satisfied.\n",
        "There's no suspense (ETs rampage from the word go); no frissons (loud hailers telegraph the shocks); and it's insufficiently bright to be an hommage.\n",
        "A choppy, unsuspenseful succession of chases, melodramatic showdowns and routine special effects.\n",
        "The Puppet Masters occasionally lives up to its reputation, but the delay between story conception and celluloid conversion has clearly wilted its power and potential.\n",
        "Attempts at detailed characterization don't work particularly well, and there's a love story that feels as forced as it is superfluous - although even that isn't as unnecessary as the film's final ten minutes.\n",
        "It's miraculous casting, and the Australian Davis -- for my money the finest actress around, bar none -- is simply uncanny in her command of East Coast gentility combined with razor-sharp timing and comedic expression.\n",
        "The Ref benefits from having actor's actors like Davis and Spacey in the leads.\n",
        "It's not a bad idea, but it's not a good movie, either.\n",
        "Whether it's a function of sloppy editing or sloppy writing, few of these supporting players and their accompanying subplots pay off.\n",
        "A foulmouthed sitcom of a film.\n",
        "The Ref works virtually none of the miracles of [Richard LaGravenese's screenplay for The Fisher King,] his previous mix 'n' match effort.\n",
        "What makes most of this work is the brio of the acting, though the direction by Ted Demme and the script by Richard LaGravenese and Marie Weiss certainly don't hurt.\n",
        "In his first starring role, comedian Leary makes his ranting career criminal strangely sympathetic.\n",
        "Staying clear of any mean-spirited attitudes, The Ref is a film to warm the hearts and touch the nerves of dysfunctional families everywhere.\n",
        "Demme brings out the comic ease in Leary.\n",
        "The Ref is one of those rare movies that seem to have everything going for it -- a promising director, terrific actors and an original, unapologetically grown-up script -- yet somehow still turns out to be a phenomenal drag.\n",
        "This is not a seamlessly constructed movie, but as long as you're not expecting great art, it's unlikely to disappoint.\n",
        "This is one holiday party you'll want to miss.\n",
        "Material like this is only as good as the acting and writing. The Ref is skillful in both areas.\n",
        "The actors keep this interesting, but as a story it drifts and rambles.\n",
        "All the meticulousness, intelligence, taste and superior acting that one expects from Merchant Ivory productions have been brought to bear.\n",
        "Who else but Merchant Ivory to give the big-screen treatment to Ishiguro's Booker Prize-winning novel about class, fascism and the stiff upper lip?\n",
        "Here's a film for adults. It's also about time to recognize that Mr. Ivory is one of our finest directors, something that critics tend to overlook because most of his films have been literary adaptations.\n",
        "What do you call filmmakers who make literary entertainment box office in the age of Beavis and Butt-bead? Try miracle workers.\n",
        "Put Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson and James Fox together and you can expect sterling performances.\n",
        "A subtle, thoughtful movie.\n",
        "There is not a false note in the movie.\n",
        "Tragic love stories often hit with the hardest impact, and few are better-crafted and more intelligently presented than that of Mr. Stevens and Miss Kenton.\n",
        "It would be nice to see Connery doing something intrinsically interesting instead of trying to make something inherently dull entertaining. And it would be good to see Snipes cut loose more than he is able to here.\n",
        "As the plot grows more intricate, strangely the tension dissipates, until finally the movie just seems to run out of breath.\n",
        "When working in genre territory before, the idiosyncratic Kaufman has shown a marked tendency to debunk or subvert conventions. Playing it straight here, he brings little to the table.\n",
        "I found it pretty entertaining, as well as provocative in some of its comments about contemporary life.\n",
        "Kaufman's PC adaptation falls awkwardly between the conventions of the Hollywood conspiracy thriller and something intended as more artily significant.\n",
        "It directs attention not to the internal reasons for America's economic problems, but to inscrutable, generalized, unknown others from abroad, whose yellow skins and strange manners announce their evil purposes as much as their unfair trade practices.\n",
        "The flaws don't cripple what is a fiercely funny, exciting and provocative detective story about the crimes of corporate culture -- crimes that transcend race and geography.\n",
        "There are a few too many plot holes and logical errors. Rising Sun may be solidly-paced, but not all aspects of the production are as successful.\n",
        "A thoroughly gratifying prestige thriller, thanks to riveting suspense and two brilliant stars.\n",
        "Connery is heaven, and so is the movie.\n",
        "The screenplay by Kaufman, Crichton and Michael Backes is not about much of anything important.\n",
        "Limiting the gore, but not the carnage, in pursuit of a PG-13 rating and more youngsters, pic remains a cluttered, nasty exercise that seems principally intent on selling action figures.\n",
        "Dekker's third instalment also comes third in terms of merit.\n",
        "In the latest episode of the series, which seems to have nearly run out of steam, he is portrayed by Robert John Burke, an actor who bears some resemblance to Mr. Weller while lacking his forerunner's tongue-in-cheek glint of authoritarian machismo.\n",
        "Why do they persist in making these retreads? Because RoboCop is a brand name, I guess, and this is this year's new model. It's an old tradition in Detroit to take an old design and slap on some fresh chrome.\n",
        "This installment goes for straight action, allowing only brief instances of the facetiousness which made the original so enjoyable.\n",
        "If you really want more RoboCop, rent the video of the first movie.\n",
        "As for the conflict, it's hardly riveting and often it's downright silly. The sets and effects betray their downsized budget. And the Japanese bashing is less artful than in Rising Sun, though just as obnoxious.\n",
        "The far-fetched plotting eventually goes so far over the top that pic flirts with inventing a new genre of film noir camp.\n",
        "It would be facile to say it substitutes style for content; actually, it substitutes stylishness for style.\n",
        "Stylistic but ultimately unsatisfying.\n",
        "Hilary Henkin's script isn't as smart as it thinks it is, and only Olin's breathtakingly excessive femme fatale hits the right note of campy panache.\n",
        "For all its promise, and for all the brittle beauty of Dariusz Wolski's cinematography, Romeo Is Bleeding eventually collapses under the weight of its violent affectations.\n",
        "Romeo is most notable for being the first film of the year to cash in on post-Bobbitt fears of castrating (and worse) females.\n",
        "Basically, there's nothing new or revolutionary about Mona.\n",
        "A satire that has the unfortunate tendency to take itself too seriously.\n",
        "An exercise in overwrought style and overwritten melodrama, and proof that a great cast cannot save a film from self-destruction.\n",
        "Romper Stomper is A Clockwork Orange without the intellect.\n",
        "The cheap 'message' of the ending fails to salvage a film that at best is well-meant but misguided, at worst, flashy and garbled.\n",
        "Exploits the frustration, anger and violence of a despicable subculture while excusing the glorification of its hate aesthetic as necessary \"reporting.\"\n",
        "It's merely another violent art house picture, slumming modishly in the world of psycho-personalities, and exhibiting only occasional flashes of originality.\n",
        "[A] well-crafted piece of middle-American uplift.\n",
        "Directed with composure, but no great fervour, the film's conspicuously uninterested in American football, and much concerned with testing the limits and the resilience of the American dream.\n",
        "For all its patness, the movie also has a gritty realism that is not found in many higher-priced versions of the same thing, and its happy ending is not the typical Hollywood leap into fantasy.\n",
        "It's Ruettiger's persistence that his teammates and the film celebrate. For that, Rudy earns a rousing cheer.\n",
        "Astin's performance is so self-effacing, so focused and low-key, that we lose sight of the underdog formula and begin to focus on this dogged kid who won't quit. And the last big scene is an emotional powerhouse, just the way it's supposed to be.\n",
        "The film is so uplifting, I felt like calling up Lou Holtz for brunch.\n",
        "Indiana has been very good to director David Anspaugh and writer Angelo Pizzo.\n",
        "The cheers in the audience at the end were genuine, which is testimony to the likability (although not necessarily the quality) of the film.\n",
        "Astin gives these familiar doings the charm they need, as he pushes towards a virtually impossible goal.\n",
        "Sympathetic performances from Danny Glover and Matt Dillon somewhat compensate for the mildness of the material, but can't disguise the fact that the film has very little to say about a major societal problem.\n",
        "Though something of a failure in its own terms, this social-conscience movie does produce a strong emotional tug...\n",
        "Whatever its shortcomings, The Saint of Fort Washington takes its subject very seriously, in ways that no audience can fail to find wrenchingly sad.\n",
        "If you have ever stopped your car at an intersection and been approached by men with squeegees, offering to clean your windshield, you may have wondered who these guys are, where they come from, and where they go at night. This movie knows.\n",
        "For this film Spielberg has done the best directing of his career. Much of his previous work has been clever and some of it better than that, but Schindler's List is masterly.\n",
        "More than any previous non-documentary Holocaust movie, this one convinces through the accumulation of such detail.\n",
        "Schindler's List is filmed in black and white, but the triumph of Neeson's portrait and Steven Zaillian's screenplay is that Oskar Schindler remains gray and enigmatic.\n",
        "What the visual immediacy of Schindler's List does is to prod each of us to fill in the gaps of emotion for ourselves. To put this another way, the more you are able to invest in this superb, demanding film, the more you are likely to get back.\n",
        "Few American movies since the silent era have had anything approaching this picture's narrative boldness, visual audacity, and emotional directness.\n",
        "What Spielberg has done in this Holocaust story is simply and forcefully place us there.\n",
        "Schindler's List is a film whose meanings are to be found less in its uplifting outline than in its harrowing flow of images -- images of fear, hope, horror, compassion, degradation, chaos, and death.\n",
        "This is the film to win over Spielberg skeptics.\n",
        "Not only is the subject matter different for Spielberg, the way it is treated is a departure both for him and for the business as usual standards of major studio releases.\n",
        "Spielberg does an uncommonly good job both of holding our interest over 185 minutes and of showing more of the nuts and bolts of the Holocaust than we usually get from fiction films.\n",
        "It's a noble achievement, and essential viewing.\n",
        "Rising brilliantly to the challenge of this material and displaying an electrifying creative intelligence, Mr. Spielberg has made sure that neither he nor the Holocaust will ever be thought of in the same way again.\n",
        "For a movie -- or more accurately, a Hollywood-approved art movie -- this often-stunning work puts the Holocaust into bracing perspective.\n",
        "Schindler's List, despite blatant compromises, is a rending historical document.\n",
        "Schindler's List is a ruthlessly unsentimental portrait of a German war profiteer's epiphany that inspires neither sorrow nor pity, but a kind of emotional numbness.\n",
        "What is most amazing about this film is how completely Spielberg serves his story. The movie is brilliantly acted, written, directed and seen.\n",
        "In a severe, uncompromising manner that none of his previous films has approached, Spielberg has captured the terror of the Nazi reign as well as the determination and resourcefulness of those who resisted.\n",
        "Because this film touches us so deeply, the catharsis has a power that few -- if any -- other moments in film history can match.\n",
        "The filmic equivalent of a hate crime.\n",
        "Strictly for viewers who don't want surprises, just a laundry list of buddyisms.\n",
        "The movie has a lot of laughs, its action sequences are thrilling, its surprises are startling, and it shows a real ingenuity in the ways by which it gets Willis into, and out of, trouble.\n",
        "Pomeranc is wonderfully real and wide-eyed as Josh, with a raspy voice and slight lisp recalling Linus from the Peanuts cartoons.\n",
        "The mystery of Fischer's talent and torment adds depth to Searching for Bobby Fischer, about a young New York chess prodigy who doesn't want his genius to ruin his life.\n",
        "True, James Horner's score seems to have strayed in from a fists-in-the-air crowd-pleaser, but it's the one weak link in an accomplished, unexpectedly winning movie.\n",
        "What Bobby Fischer took away, dashing the hopes and the innocence of his acolytes when he spurned chess, may never truly be recaptured. But some of it has found its way to the screen.\n",
        "Chess may not be the most exciting activity to watch, but Searching for Bobby Fischer makes for engaging entertainment.\n",
        "Searching for Bobby Fischer does for chess what The Karate Kid did for martial arts, albeit with considerably more complexity and class.\n",
        "As the boy with a cute little lisp, who emerges from his toy room to mastermind his kings, queens and bishops to tactical victory, Pomeranc imbues the movie with irresistible naivete.\n",
        "If we can operate at the genius level in a given field, does that mean we must -- even if the cost is the sort of endless purgatory a Bobby Fischer has inhabited? It's an interesting question, and this movie doesn't avoid it.\n",
        "Second Best tries too hard for sincerity, when it's actually more sincere when cynical.\n",
        "While the dialogue and characterizations frequently resonate with uncomfortable truths and some genuine humor, the central character's quirks are far more irritating than illuminating.\n",
        "Might have made a good stage monologue, but as a film it's overstated and barely baked.\n",
        "Unfortunately there's nothing very sympathetic about Elliot, or even interesting.\n",
        "A sour and pointless exercise.\n",
        "Though the essays are smartly written and Pantoliano manages to make Elliot vaguely sympathetic, Second Best is a long slog in the dumps.\n",
        "An ugly, amateurish film that champions mediocrity in a meta-attempt to justify its own ineptitude.\n",
        "While the film is lazily directed, it strikes an agreeable balance of wry humor and the soulful observation of lives lived in the shadow of everyone else's achievements.\n",
        "Compare and despair: that wise, useful adage popularized by 12-step programs could be the subtitle of Eric Weber's sloppy but smart-enough-to- make-you-squirm comedy.\n",
        "The result is an instant classic -- rich, dense, resonant, powerful.\n",
        "While drawing superb performances from her young leads, Holland has masterfully contrasted the garden -- a place where melodic robins seem almost conversant -- with the dread of Misselthwaite.\n",
        "The movie's dark themes, unhurried pace and talkiness make it something of a gamble for many children. But older children -- especially those who have been asking specific questions about death -- may find some nourishment in this garden.\n",
        "This enchanted tale vividly shows how love heals and nurtures barren souls, makes them flourish like abundant Edens.\n",
        "Rather than a fresh breeze, it's the stale air of gilded calculation, the uncomfortable feeling that things are excessively \"just so,\" that overhangs much that is genuinely appealing about this film.\n",
        "It's as if the moviemakers were trying to cook up a New Age Yorkshire pudding, without meat drippings -- what's missing is Burnett's robust optimism and animistic energy.\n",
        "Screenwriter Caroline Thompson and director Agnieszka Holland have turned Frances Hodgson Burnett's rather gothic 1911 children's book into an evocative, beautifully realized picture.\n",
        "The film is gorgeous to look at, from its period accouterments to its wanderings in explored space (the house is full of secret passageways) to its use of color.\n",
        "Executed to near perfection in all artistic departments, this superior adaptation of the perennial favorite novel will find its core public among girls , but should prove satisfying enough to a range of audiences.\n",
        "It is, first and foremost, a visual delight, a Victorian picture book come to life, from its brief prologue in India through its darkly enchanted recreation of Misselthwaite Manor on the Yorkshire moors.\n",
        "With well-judged performances played straight, and topical subtexts (Green consciousness, the dysfunctional family), this 'children's' film sets no age limit on its potential audience.\n",
        "Ms. Holland's film of The Secret Garden is elegantly expressive, a discreet and lovely rendering of the children's classic by Frances Hodgson Burnett.\n",
        "It is a work of beauty, poetry and deep mystery, and watching it is like entering for a time into a closed world where one's destiny may be discovered.\n",
        "The young actors are quite proficient and un-sappy too -- it's not their fault if they too often seem like chessmen being moved around on the director's board, composed into picturesque tableaux.\n",
        "The Secret Garden has at least two things going for it: remarkable acting and mesmerizing cinematography (by Roger Deakins).\n",
        "What a pleasure -- and what a challenge for the filmmakers -- to come up with a movie that exists primarily on ambience, character interplay, English accents and subtle class differences.\n",
        "The movie is earnest, heartfelt, and, for all its lavishness, rather plodding.\n",
        "Rather mild and scattershot in its satiric marksmanship...\n",
        "An uproariously funny, marvellously malicious performance from Turner.\n",
        "The murders are multiple but the joke is strictly one-note.\n",
        "A killingly funny spoof of crime and nonpunishment.\n",
        "Too realistically gory to really be funny.\n",
        "Offensively tame and almost (gasp) tasteful.\n",
        "I am not sure why this isn't very funny, but it's not.\n",
        "While the idea sounds fertile, the execution is uneven, and the comedy sporadic at best.\n",
        "At worst, the film is an empty vessel that places blind trust in affected stillness and symmetry... the movie quite often switches on a dime to more deep and meaningful textures.\n",
        "There are great images in this film.\n",
        "There is beauty in Kagemusha but it is impersonal, distant and ghostly. The old master has never been more rigorous.\n",
        "Biting down on his pipe, his shirt collar permanently askew, Hopkins assays another concerted study in English repression -- a condition unexpectedly relieved by Winger's brash intelligence and brittle wit.\n",
        "Superlative acting by Hopkins and Winger elevates this fictionalized late-in-life romance between the repressed British scholar and writer C.S. Lewis and the American Jewish housewife-poet who introduces him to sex and rejuvenates his life.\n",
        "Here is Mr. Hopkins giving an amazingly versatile and moving performance, shifting the light in those knowing blue eyes to reveal endless shadings between delight and sorrow.\n",
        "Sit back, watch a master at work, and never once believe that you're not observing the real C.S. Lewis.\n",
        "It understands that not everyone falls into love through the avenue of physical desire; that for some, the lust may be for another's mind, for inner beauty.\n",
        "A high-class tear-jerker about the romance of repressed British writer C.S. Lewis with feisty American poet Joy Gresham.\n",
        "Shadowlands is illuminated from beginning to end by Hopkins. This may be the best thing he's ever done.\n",
        "As the grand ringmaster, it's here that Altman passes the baton to his actors , whose behavioral insights are critical to the film's success.\n",
        "Inevitably it's a mixed bag, though the film's assurance in keeping it all coherent is at times exhilarating.\n",
        "From the exhilarating opening, you know Altman's epic 'adaptation' of eight stories and a poem by Raymond Carver is going to be special.\n",
        "The lives are often desperate and the characters inarticulate, but the group portrait is as grandly, sometimes as hilariously, realized as anything the director has ever done.\n",
        "Triumphantly fierce, funny, moving and innovative.\n",
        "The movie is based on short stories by Raymond Carver, but this is Altman's work, not Carver's, and all the film really has in common with its source is a feeling for people who are disconnected.\n",
        "Altman, who has made a career of pulling the critics and cineastes his way, demonstrates that artistic sleight of hand once again.\n",
        "It's a genuine pleasure to find a movie with such a deep and intelligent portrayal of simple human lives, with all their minor triumphs and tragedies.\n",
        "A cynical, sexist and shallow work from cinema's premier misanthrope, Robert Altman, who here shows neither compassion for -- nor insight into -- the human condition.\n",
        "Ultimately, Six Degrees of Separation will succeed or fail for the individual viewer based on their expectations and preferences.\n",
        "It's too clever by half, an inside joke aimed at the New York gentry.\n",
        "Mostly, Sleepless in Seattle leaves you feeling restless in the audience.\n",
        "If one can ignore all the straining for lightness here, this is watchable enough, though hardly anything resembling a tearjerker.\n",
        "Ephron and fellow writers Jeff Arch and David S. Ward have conspired to make Sleepless in Seattle as purposefully schmaltzy as one can imagine, in a manner that's almost cynical.\n",
        "It's easily the hippest, frankest and funniest date movie around.\n",
        "The schmaltzy soundtrack is overdone, but cameraman Sven Nykvist wraps it all up in an appropriately warm glow.\n",
        "Nora Ephron's Sleepless in Seattle is a feather-light romantic comedy about two lovers who meet for the first time in the last reel. It's a stunt, but it's a stunt that works far more effectively than anybody in his right mind has reason to expect.\n",
        "A quick check of the exiting audience found many smiling -- and still clutching tissues.\n",
        "Sleepless in Seattle is as ephemeral as a talk show, as contrived as the late show, and yet so warm and gentle I smiled the whole way through.\n",
        "We fall -- and I think a lot of people will fall hard for this movie -- even though we know we shouldn't.\n",
        "This is a dreamy, romantic fantasy whose mood falls somewhere between magic and reality.\n",
        "Sharon Stone goes cold in this botched thiller-maybe from the effort of pretending that her character, a beauteous book editor, would fall for the preening young computer wizard played by the vacant-and-proud-of-it William Baldwin.\n",
        "This is perhaps the only science-fiction film that can be called transcendental.\n",
        "As a display terminal for the wizardry of Designers Lawrence G. Paull, Douglas Trumbull and Syd Mead, the movie delivers.\n",
        "This definitive print should be the last little push that \"Blade Runner\" needs to complete its 25-year journey from box office failure to cult favorite to full-blown classic.\n",
        "The film still represents the cutting edge of dark science fiction.\n",
        "Blade Runner: The Final Cut plays better now than ever.\n",
        "Open the champagne: Blade Runner is finally just the way Ridley Scott wanted it. And it only took 25 years.\n",
        "There are no plot-altering additions or subtractions. But the digitally spruced print is gorgeous to look at and listen to.\n",
        "Much of the film's erotic charge and moral and ideological ambiguity stem from the fact that these characters are very nearly the only ones we care about.\n",
        "This is a seminal film, building on older classics like Metropolis or Things to Come, but establishing a pervasive view of the future that has influenced science fiction films ever since.\n",
        "Ridley Scott created a triumph of retro-futuristic design over narrative or character richness.\n",
        "The opportunity to see one of the milestone visual achievements in a big hall with a giant screen is not to be missed. And even if you saw Blade Runner in a theater in 1982, this will be an entirely new experience.\n",
        "Mainly, the re-release is a good excuse to indulge once more in Scott's iconic and highly influential vision of a future Los Angeles choked by rain, neon and cheap pleasure palaces.\n",
        "These days, it's almost impossible to find a gritty science fiction motion picture that doesn't owe at least a small debt to Blade Runner's visual style.\n",
        "A stylistically dazzling film noir set in November 2019 in a brilliantly imagined Los Angeles marked by both technological wonders and horrendous squalor.\n",
        "The android villains are neither menacing nor sympathetic, when ideally they should have been both. This leaves Scott's picturesque violence looking dull and exploitative.\n",
        "As intricately detailed as anything a science-fiction film has yet envisioned.\n",
        "It is, in fact, an amazingly sophisticated, sumptuously visionary treatise on the consequences of attaining god-hood.\n",
        "The film is great on every level: the poignant screenplay about man's futile quest for immortality; Scott's tremendous direction; the incredible, futuristic sets designed by Lawrence G. Paull, Syd Mead and others; the phenomenal special effects.\n",
        "Some of the comic writing undercuts the preposterous story.\n",
        "The film is so proud of its alleged daring that it even begins with a dictionary definition of the word 'deviant.' 'Sitcom' would have been more like it.\n",
        "Threesome, by falling into the common trap of mistaking pretentiousness for substance, loses its way early on.\n",
        "Not a great movie, but in its own way it is an effective one, and more than most other movies it is accurate and honest about the sexuality of young people.\n",
        "A tedious, toilet-talking, try-sexual tease.\n",
        "The three become a giggly and rather insufferable bunch.\n",
        "Part avant-garde art film, part amusing but morbid fairy tale, it is a delightfully ghoulish holiday musical that displays more inventiveness in its brief 75 minutes than some studios can manage in an entire year.\n",
        "This full-length animated movie was shot in stop motion, with all the febrile, twittery fascination that the medium exerts; it has a magic-toy shop feeling, with unexpected objects stuttering into life.\n",
        "Burton and his collaborators present a movie musical that's like nothing you've ever seen.\n",
        "Visually a macabre knockout, this 75-minute fantasy boasts some of the wittiest, most vigorous stop-motion animation effects in the history of the process.\n",
        "Burton, the man who gave us Batman, Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands, is incapable of a conventional idea. His take on the holiday fairy tale is delightfully off the wall.\n",
        "Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas has a grotesque charm, a pie-eyed magic.\n",
        "This cautionary fable (Be True to Your Ghoulish Self) may be a little too twisted for little kids but anyone 8 or older will spot the friendly glint behind jack's empty eye sockets.\n",
        "I'm not sure I've ever seen a fantasy film that's at once so visually amazing and so emotionally dead.\n",
        "A work of grand visual wit, clever songs, funny gags and genuine pathos, it is perhaps the greatest stop-motion animated film ever, a painstaking style of model animation that computers have all but completely done away with.\n",
        "A fun house of funereal glamour.\n",
        "The set designs are ingenious and the songs (music and lyrics by Danny Elfman) are fairly good.\n",
        "The dazzling techniques employed here create a strikinglook that's never been seen in such sustained form, making this a unique curio that will appeal to kids and film enthusiasts alike.\n",
        "The hippest of all holiday classics, the 1993 release rendered anew in 3-D format remains a postmodern three-ring circus of morbid humor, eye-popping puppet animation and show-stopping songs.\n",
        "Flattened for years on cable and video, Nightmare has been resurrected in all its tactile glory.\n",
        "(Producer Tim) Burton's skewed vision is seamlessly realized by director Henry Selick and cleverly enhanced by Danny Elfman's songs.\n",
        "This is the movie puts the \"oooh\" back in \"boo.\"\n",
        "Thirteen years after its debut, Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas has gone 3D, which makes a good thing even better.\n",
        "If the 3-D fails to grab you as much as you might hope, it never takes you out of the movie, which is a remarkable feat.\n",
        "The script's non-stop momentum suits the roller-coaster photography -- and the punchy running time brings things to a close before eye-strain sets in.\n",
        "The Nightmare Before Christmas is a major step forward for both stop-motion animation, which is stunningly well used, and for Mr. Burton himself. He now moves from the level of extremely talented eccentric to that of Disney-style household word.\n",
        "A lot of care and attention were obviously devoted to selecting locations, designing sets, and grooming handlebar mustaches. Much less attention went to making one believe that any of the events took place circa 1879.\n",
        "A tough-talking but soft-hearted tale that is entertaining in a sprawling, old-fashioned manner.\n",
        "There's a misguided romantic subplot and the ending rather sprawls, but mostly this is rootin', tootin' entertainment.\n",
        "It wants to be at once traditional and morally ambiguous. The two visions don't quite harmonize.\n",
        "Highly stylized fashion-wise but awkwardly unfocused in its plotlines, it aims for the western iconography of Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone but never gets past its own directorial hurdles.\n",
        "It's difficult to assign responsibility for the most serious of this film's shortcomings, but one thing is clear: somewhere along the way, the creative process misfired.\n",
        "Plays like a three-hour rough cut that's been trimmed down to a slightly shorter rough cut.\n",
        "If shoot-'em-up, gobble-'em-down movies like The Fugitive and Jurassic Park are rated PG-13 these days, what does an R-rated action adventure look like? Like True Romance: violent to a fault, glam to the max.\n",
        "Provides some amazing encounters, bravura acting turns and gruesome carnage. But it doesn't add up to enough.\n",
        "If the romance seldom seems 'true', the spiralling violence (script, Quentin Tarantino) does succeed, in a brutish, cod-Jacobean kind of way.\n",
        "This film's various outrages are committed unapologetically, and are very much in the service of its bizarre story.\n",
        "It's Tarantino's gutter poetry that detonates True Romance. This movie is dynamite.\n",
        "Sifting through the bloody, pulpy trash of True Romance -- should you care to -- you'll find amusing, smart-alecky nuggets planted by screenwriter Quentin Tarantino.\n",
        "The movie may be stylistically visceral, but it's aesthetically corrupt. It might as well have been called Pump Up the Violence.\n",
        "If you're in the mood for this sort of absurd, violent nonsense ... True Romance does deliver.\n",
        "Despite Tony Scott's occasional blundering, True Romance is still a visceral roller coaster.\n",
        "Made with such energy, such high spirits, such an enchanting goofiness, that it's impossible to resist.\n",
        "Like most of his work, Stanley Kubrick's deadly black satirical comedy-thriller on cold war madness and its possible effects (1964) has aged well.\n",
        "Perhaps Kubrick's most perfectly realised film, simply because his cynical vision of the progress of technology and human stupidity is wedded with comedy.\n",
        "This landmark movie's madcap humor and terrifying suspense remain undiminished by time.\n",
        "Stanley Kubrick's blackest of black comedies.\n",
        "Is Dr. Strangelove Kubrick's best movie? Along with Paths of Glory, absolutely.\n",
        "Stanley Kubrick's first genuinely original movie has been seen, reseen, dissected, and iconized, but a few sly truths about it have yet to be fully grokked.\n",
        "The film is always saying something, and a viewer would have to be deaf and blind not to recognize the targets of the sarcasm.\n",
        "The most shattering sick joke I've ever come across.\n",
        "Dr. Strangelove (1964) is filled with great comic performances.\n",
        "Built on a wispy premise better suited to the realm of TV, The Pagemaster plays like a slickly produced afternoon special.\n",
        "Mediocre, really, this mixture of real actors and animation.\n",
        "A pallid film framed at the start and finish by live action and mostly composed of cheap-looking animation.\n",
        "A splendidly original children's fantasy about the world of books.\n",
        "This clever, often engaging, and always fast-paced motion picture uses the visual medium to encourage its viewers to reach out with their imagination.\n",
        "A sad and dreary film.\n",
        "Plays too much like a TV cartoon.\n",
        "...an impressive, funny urban comedy of manners from a suitably distinctive voice that I hope we'll hear again soon.\n",
        "For almost an hour, Delpy chases the spirits of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell; why, then, an ultimate fondness for Ralph Bellamy?\n",
        "A movie that is as acutely painful as it is acutely funny.\n",
        "The last time I laughed so hard at a movie, it was Nigel Tufnel telling us his amplifier went to 11.\n",
        "2 Days in Paris proves Delpy's got an authentic ear for humor in two languages, and she turns the dewy-eyed notion of Paris as a city for lovers firmly and affectionately on its tete.\n",
        "Bright and engaging a great deal of the time, but it ends up exhausted.\n",
        "Delpy does the old-[Woody] Allen thing a lot better than most, and does for Paris what Allen did for Manhattan, making it look newly romantic even to those who have lived there all their lives.\n",
        "Partly a study of cross-national relationships and partly a homecoming comedy on Delpy's part, 'Two Days in Paris' neatly balances stabs at both America and the French.\n",
        "Goldberg and Delpy also give their characters a wistful charm, and Delpy's zippy, dialog-heavy screenplay sparkles with wit.\n",
        "Delpy has a knack for finding just the right details; filming in her own hometown, she fills the movie with funny cross-cultural observances.\n",
        "It's possible to watch 2 Days in Paris and have absolutely no idea who's calling the shots. This is excellent news because it means that we gain a director without losing an actress.\n",
        "Satirical and casual in its approach, and Delpy's grasp of the material is assured.\n",
        "[Delpy has] created two original, quirky characters so obsessed with their differences that Paris is almost a distraction. I don't think I heard a single accordion in the whole film.\n",
        "Sweet and discreet.\n",
        "2 Days in Paris may seem familiar, with its manic, walking-and-talking rhythms reminiscent of Woody Allen and Diane Keaton in the 1970s. But you never know where it's going, which is one of the film's greatest pleasures.\n",
        "One of the highlights of the 1995 Toronto Festival, Solondz's second film is a stark, often funny, always poignant comedy about suburban mores, centering on a misfit Jewish girl tormented by her family and classmates.\n",
        "At 87 minutes, Dollhouse is a near-perfect morsel. If nothing else, it informs older folk that school principals still threaten to record bad behavior in one's 'personal record' -- only now, computers facilitate the process.\n",
        "I've more or less had it with this stuff, but the film is distinguished by the grubby velocity of his foot chases, and the effectiveness of its craft (not to mention the unglamorous resolution of at least one character's fate).\n",
        "Easily the best cop thriller since The Departed.\n",
        "The Chaser is an expert serial-killer film from South Korea and a poster child for what a well-made thriller looked like in the classic days.\n",
        "The pessimism of Na's slick debut rings false.\n",
        "South Korean first-timer Na Hong-jin offers nasty thrills, manic foot chases and some genuinely subversive riffs on the police procedural.\n",
        "A grisly serial-killer thriller that develops into a howl of outrage at the ineptitude of the system.\n",
        "This playfulness, however, backfires massively in the second half when coincidence and unforeseen consequence conspire uneasily with bloody, messy results.\n",
        "Guillermo del Toro's feature debut is an arch twist on the vampire tale.\n",
        "Cronos surprises with its sophisticated and spirited look at a tale straight from the crypt.\n",
        "While the film's first half entices with its secrets, the second half falls into a predictable narrative that refuses to even suggest possibilities.\n",
        "You have to admire the style, sincerity, and overall sense of craft even if you don't fancy the comic-book gore.\n",
        "A most startling genre piece: tender, imaginative and wholly its own.\n",
        "A very stylish and sophisticated Mexican variation on some age-old themes.\n",
        "Cronos is not really about plot. It is about character.\n",
        "It's also an amazingly assured feature debut for the 29-year-old del Toro, who is both its writer and director.\n",
        "An enormously enjoyable gothic yarn from Mexico.\n",
        "There were no unnerving images in Cronos. There's a lot of blood and gore -- but that's rather routine.\n",
        "Kika is actually one of this film maker's more buoyant recent efforts, a sly, rambunctious satire that moves along merrily until it collapses -- as many Almodovar films finally do -- under the weight of its own clutter.\n",
        "It doesn't matter that Kika doesn't make sense -- doesn't even try to make sense. It's just so much fun to watch.\n",
        "Something alarming has happened to Almodovar: He has become commonplace and predictable.\n",
        "Almodovar's central parody is strong enough to save this film from floundering too much or too often. It's daring and nasty, but rarely brilliant.\n",
        "The great costumes and sets are more substantial than the plot and characters.\n",
        "Makes it clear Hollywood wanted it both ways: It benefitted from the richness that gays added to films, but didn't want to acknowledge their sexuality.\n",
        "Top-notch entertainment, not only because it's enjoyable, but because it argues its case with an effectiveness that would impress even a top-notch, homophobic attorney.\n",
        "It's interesting to see how gay and lesbian themes began to be treated openly in films, but it's fascinating to see how -- earlier -- those themes were used subtextually in films that make no overt reference to the real subject.\n",
        "A curiously sour movie in its amused contempt for this fatuous family.\n",
        "[Director Thomas] drawn hilariously synthetic performances from a shrewdly cloned cast.\n",
        "The actors try hard, but the screenplay isn't solid enough to keep any of them consistently clever.\n",
        "The Brady Bunch Movie is never more than lightly amusing, but then neither was the TV show.\n",
        "Part homage, part spoof, the deft balancing act is a clever, engaging adaption.\n",
        "Wonder of wonders, Thomas and her colleagues have turned this mother lode of 1970s kitsch into a pretty tasty little comedy.\n",
        "I hate to admit it, but I laughed at the Brady Bunch Movie. I laughed a lot.\n",
        "The problem with The Brady Bunch is that, satirical or serious, ninety minutes is too much.\n",
        "The film establishes a bland, reassuring, comforting Brady reality - a certain muted tone that works just fine but needs, I think, a bleaker contrast from outside to fully exploit the humor.\n",
        "If dumbness is a large part of our problem, then The Brady Bunch Movie is a small (and oddly cheery) part of its solution.\n",
        "A gentle, passable spoof.\n",
        "The movie is quite enjoyable as long as it explores the fantasy of a neglected little boy having an entire house of his own to explore and play in, and it still manages to be fun when he exhibits superhuman ingenuity and resourcefulness.\n",
        "Pic boasts wonderful casting, with Culkin a delight as funny, resilient Kevin, and O'Hara bringing a snappy, zesty energy to the role of mom.\n",
        "[The movie has] an inconsistency of mood not helped by abrupt editing and Columbus' sometimes self-conscious direction.\n",
        "[A] surprisingly charming film, which may be the first Christmas black comedy for children.\n",
        "This holiday contender from John Hughes is too crass, too loud and too violent to be added blithely to Christmas viewing traditions. But it is funny.\n",
        "If Home Alone had limited itself to the things that might possibly happen to a forgotten 8-year-old, I think I would have liked it more.\n",
        "Chris Columbus's junky, rambunctiously funny Home Alone is every kid's anarchical wish come true.\n",
        "The movie devolves into an egregious Three Stooges painfest: We're meant to giggle and clap along with Kevin as the crooks get their heads singed with blowtorches and walk barefoot on glass.\n",
        "The movie's slogan is \"Believe,\" not an unreasonable request. But even those who'd be happy to comply must get past Ghost's one casting jaw-dropper, a certain woolly-mindedness to its script and a production prettified to the point of stickiness.\n",
        "What it offers, apart from the overblown special effects that seem inescapable in American movies, is an unusual and effective combination of swooning, morbid romance and screwball comedy.\n",
        "The passion and poignancy of trying to communicate with the dead is well-exploited here. Moore has never been more fetching.\n",
        "Given its obviously commercial aims, Ghost is remarkably appealing on a purely personal level. It is about how you deal with death.\n",
        "Ghost is one part horror picture, one part comedy, one part love story, one part murder mystery and four parts entrancing.\n",
        "A bad movie that a lot of people will like.\n",
        "There's something offensive about the movie's chintzy view of death and the way it periodically flirts with promising conceits only to back away from them in as cowardly a manner as possible.\n",
        "It sounds like a horror movie, but it's a romantic fairy tale. The scariest thing about it is its shamelessness.\n",
        "Ghost is a dazzlingly enjoyable pop thriller.\n",
        "Ghost is an odd creation -- at times nearly smothering in arty somberness, at others veering into good, wacky fun.\n",
        "A comedy, romance and supernatural thriller rolled into one, Ghost is a zippy pastiche that somehow manages to seem fresh even though it's built entirely out of borrowed parts.\n",
        "The real credit for turning a minor mystic romance into one of the most enjoyable movies of the year rests on an excellent script by Bruce Joel Rubin, and on the surprisingly sure direction of Jerry Zucker.\n",
        "Ghost' is too slow moving at times, and a few of its special effects look incongruously silly, particularly those showing what happens to ghosts not as virtuous as Sam.\n",
        "Zucker dutifully pushes all the buttons -- romance, thrills, laughs, tears -- that have been pushed before by more assured hands.\n",
        "Surprisingly entertaining.\n",
        "The actors succeed quite nicely in unifying the movie's multiple personalities, its ricocheting screenplay.\n",
        "Contains some nice ideas, and occasionally, for whole moments at a time, succeeds in evoking the mysteries that it toys with.\n",
        "A pop epiphany, marking that commercially creative point where the power of Hollywood meets the purity of myth.\n",
        "Terminator 2 does work viscerally, however, and with this kind of movie, that's really what counts. No problemo.\n",
        "The pathos of the film is the pathos of its leading character -- it is a magnificent machine, but a machine it remains.\n",
        "More elaborate than the original, but just as shrewdly put together, it cleverly combines the most successful elements of its predecessor with a number of new twists to produce one hell of a wild ride.\n",
        "The picture is full of spectacular action sequences and dazzling special effects, but the narrative doesn't have the snap of the original's: it's lumbering and monotonous, and it carries a heavy-handed anti-nuke message.\n",
        "Inside Terminator 2 beats a human heart. But its soul is that of a killer machine.\n",
        "Schwarzenegger is in impeccable deadpan form, milking his tough-guy image for all it's worth and getting laughs out of the Terminator's wooden parroting of slang (\"No problemo\" probably will be a catch-phrase to reckon with this summer).\n",
        "Terminator 2 is a state-of-the-art action movie, all right: It gets you thinking that the most reasonable thing might just have been to blow everyone away.\n",
        "A humongous, visionary parable that intermittently enthralls and ultimately disappoints. T2 is half of a terrific movie -- the wrong half.\n",
        "For all its state-of-the-art pyrotechnics and breathtaking thrills, this bruisingly exciting movie never loses sight of its humanity. That's its point, and its pride.\n",
        "Arnold Schwarzenegger is more comfortable and assured here than the first time around, reprising a role so perfectly suited to the voice and physique that have established him as a larger-than-life film persona.\n",
        "As a fancy mechanism fueled by the pleasure of watching legions of people and equipment being summarily destroyed, this is pretty hot stuff.\n",
        "Structured as a simple chase, the story sags midway, but the first hour and last 30 minutes display an enjoyably relentless bravura.\n",
        "Mr. Cameron has made a swift, exciting special-effects epic that thoroughly justifies its vast expense and greatly improves upon the first film's potent but rudimentary visual style.\n",
        "It's Cameron's show; he's the reigning king of movie pow, with dark wit and a poet's eye for mayhem. T2 cost a reported $100 million, and you can actually see where the money went.\n",
        "It's a tank of a movie, big, powerful and hard to resist.\n",
        "Nobody, I think, will complain that it doesn't have enough action.\n",
        "Brutally beautiful, darkly comic sci-fi\n",
        "Few films have matched it within the science fiction genre for sheer white-knuckle exhilaration.\n",
        "The important issues raised by the film- centered on the cultural, racial and moral struggle that took place on the American frontier-are glossed over in favor of a juvenile fantasy of male bonding around the campfire.\n",
        "This collective array of talent has yielded a western that is at once original and traditional. Dances With Wolves looks back to the masterworks of the past and, with its relevance to our present, it deserves to be ranked with them.\n",
        "A slow-moving but well-acted western.\n",
        "Dances With Wolves is a clear-eyed vision. Authentic as an Edward Curtis photograph, lyrical as a George Catlin oil or a Karl Bodmer landscape, this is a film with a pure ring to it.\n",
        "Costner tells a personal story that never loses touch with the vast Western spaces encompassing and defining it. Dances With Wolves is an epic that breathes. And it's a beauty.\n",
        "As a director, Costner is alive to the sweep of the country and the expansive spirit of the western-movie tradition.\n",
        "In his directorial debut, Kevin Costner brings a rare degree of grace and feeling to this elegiac tale.\n",
        "Sincere, capable, at times moving, but overextended, this picture is seriously hampered by its tendency to linger over everything -- especially landscapes with silhouetted figures, and not excluding its own good intentions.\n",
        "Once you're sucked into the leisurely narrative, it's hard to resist.\n",
        "Its triumph is that it is never exactly boring, only dulled. It's a movie in acute need of sharpening.\n",
        "It's a rousing adventure, a touching romance, and a stirring drama.\n",
        "Costner (with Michael Blake's screenplay) creates a vision so childlike, so willfully romantic, it's hard to put up a fight.\n",
        "A simple story, magnificently told.\n",
        "Recalls the sweep as well as the intimacy of a David Lean epic.\n",
        "A stunning combination of all-American boyishness and sweeping grandeur.\n",
        "[A] beautiful and soft-headed frontier epic, which looks at Native Americans through New Age-colored glasses.\n",
        "Batman is packed with action, clever sight gags, interesting complications and goes all out on bat with batmania: batplane, batboat, batcycle, etc. etc.\n",
        "I'd choose Adam West's Batmobile over Michael Keaton's any day.\n",
        "Jonathan Demme's hypnotic adaptation of the Thomas Harris novel has a seriousness and intensity that's been entirely lacking in horror movies lately.\n",
        "Hopkins' cumulative screen image is one of civility and decency, and the association adds to the withering, macabre effect of his murderer. It is a remarkably lucid portrait of lunacy.\n",
        "Demme comes at Harris' material from another angle: His movie may deal with madness, but his perspective is mercifully sane.\n",
        "It's a gnarled, brutal, highly manipulative film that, at its center, seems morally indefensible.\n",
        "Jonathan Demme's thriller is artful pulp -- tabloid material treated with intelligence and care and a weird kind of sensitivity.\n",
        "Hopkins' performance may be the film's bravura showpiece, but Foster's goes the whole distance, steadfast, controlled, heartbreakingly insightful, a fine addition to her gallery of characterizations.\n",
        "Foster's character, who is appealing, is dwarfed by the monsters she is after. I'd rather see her work on another case.\n",
        "This is the grandest guignol Hollywood has produced in years.\n",
        "A pretty sharp new thriller.\n",
        "The juiciest part is Hopkins,' and he makes the most of it. Helped by some highly dramatic lighting, actor makes the role the personification of brilliant, hypnotic evil, and the screen jolts with electricity whenever he is on.\n",
        "An accomplished, effective, grisly, and exceptionally sick slasher film that I can't with any conscience recommend, because the purposes to which it places its considerable ingenuity are ultimately rather foul.\n",
        "Understandably, much has been made of Hopkins' hypnotic Lecter, but the laurels must go to Levine's killer, admirably devoid of camp overstatement, and to Foster, who evokes a vulnerable but pragmatic intelligence.\n",
        "It's a bona fide classic of its kind.\n",
        "The Silence of the Lambs is pop film making of a high order. It could well be the first big hit of the year.\n",
        "For all the unbridled savagery on display, what is shrewd, significant and finally hopeful about Silence of the Lambs is the way it proves that a movie can be mercilessly scary and mercifully humane at the same time.\n",
        "There is little doubt that the most memorable aspect of The Silence of the Lambs is Anthony Hopkins' incomparable performance as Lecter.\n",
        "A smart, restrained entertainment, it doesn't splash around in blood and hysteria.\n",
        "Adroitly directed by Jonathan Demme, it lurks about the exquisite edge of horror, before finally leaping into an unholy maw of bloody bones and self-awareness.\n",
        "The popularity of Jonathan Demme's movie is likely to last as long as there is a market for being scared.\n",
        "Demme has created a supremely sensuous and hypnotic thriller, one that's likely to become his first major hit.\n",
        "It's got storytelling vigor and clarity, bright, eclectic animation, and a frisky musical wit.\n",
        "It's exceptionally difficult to make an audience care for animated characters unless they're mermaids or anthropomorphized animals or insects, yet the Disney animators, with a big assist from the vocal talents of a superb cast, have pulled it off.\n",
        "Beauty and the Beast is certainly adequate holiday entertainment for children and their more indulgent parents... But the film has little of the technical facility, vivid characterization and emotional impact of Disney past.\n",
        "Magic.\n",
        "A lovely film that ranks with the best of Disney's animated classics.\n",
        "What you gain in an extra, faked dimension you lose in lively, genuine beauty.\n",
        "The set pieces are narcotically pleasing, especially the Busby Berkeley-style dancing-kitchenware spectacular, \"Be Our Guest,\" and the romantic ballroom centerpiece that brings Beauty and her Beast together.\n",
        "The 3-D pops out to enhance the drama or energy of scenes in which settings are large and integral to the action.\n",
        "Some youthful memories are better not revisited, but this definitely isn't one of them. Sometimes you can go home again.\n",
        "Beauty and the Beast is one of the year`s most entertaining films for both adults and children.\n",
        "It is a surprise, in a time of sequels and retreads, that the new film is so fresh and altogether triumphant in its own right.\n",
        "Despite some excessive narrative streamlining, this 1991 release was the best Disney animated feature in years, full of charm and humor.\n",
        "Its animators' pens are wands; their movement enchants.\n",
        "A uniquely elegant and entertaining mix of hand-drawn classicism and high-tech innovation.\n",
        "[A] great film...\n",
        "There's still room in this world for innocent love stories -- and tales as old as time.\n",
        "Brims with charm, style, and flawless execution that doesn't feel the least bit dated by subsequent technological advancements.\n",
        "It's not an especially scary movie, but right from the start, you can tell that this Beauty and the Beast has a beauty of a bite.\n",
        "A sporadically brilliant escape that at times stops to preen and pose, like that he-man lout Gaston.\n",
        "In the Imax format, the introduction of the Beast's castle has a breathtaking 3-D effect. And throughout the film, you see textures and details you never noticed.\n",
        "Although it may lack the heart-tugging appeal of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the consensus among animation fans is that 1940's Pinocchio remains the most perfect animated feature Walt Disney produced.\n",
        "Pinocchio is a substantial piece of entertainment for young and old.\n",
        "The charm, humor and loving care with which it treats its inanimate characters puts it in a class by itself.\n",
        "It still is the best thing Mr. Disney has done and therefore the best cartoon ever made.\n",
        "Probably shows Disney's virtues and vices more clearly than any other cartoon.\n",
        "The moral lessons include a literalization of metaphors about lying and other forms of misbehaving, and the grasp of a little boy's emotions and behavior often borders on the uncanny.\n",
        "Was there ever a scarier, more exciting animated feature than Pinocchio?\n",
        "This is old-fashioned, assembly-line moviemaking without the old panache.\n",
        "Pic's casting is astute, with Gere underplaying like a sturdy ballet star who hoists the ballerina Roberts on his shoulders.\n",
        "It's saying Roberts' character becomes a better person when she lands a rich guy and learns to cry at the opera.\n",
        "He pays her $3,000 and they fall in love -- ain't Hollywood grand?\n",
        "For a film that attempts to satirise snooty materialism, it focuses too pantingly on the designer labels, and comes down firmly on the side of 'rich is better'.\n",
        "It is something special.\n",
        "A slick, instantly and entertainingly digestible Cinderella fable.\n",
        "The sweetest and most openhearted love fable since The Princess Bride.\n",
        "Pretty Woman seduces all but the most wary.\n",
        "As shamelessly irresistible as the Roy Orbison oldie that accompanies the credits.\n",
        "Arguably the strongest Hollywood movie of the 1960s -- a western that galvanizes the cliches of its dying genre with a shocking jolt of delirious carnage.\n",
        "In an era when body-count films mirror the mounting body count offscreen, The Wild Bunch dissects death rather than glorifying it.\n",
        "The Wild Bunch is an American masterpiece, one of the greatest films ever produced in the Hollywood system.\n",
        "It is certainly one of the best westerns ever made, and the best film of any kind to come out in 1969.\n",
        "It's a towering achievement that grows more riveting and resonant with the years.\n",
        "The Wild Bunch is Peckinpah's most complex inquiry into the metamorphosis of man into myth. Not incidentally, it is also a raucous, violent, powerful feat of American film making.\n",
        "Film at 145 minutes is far over-length, and should be tightened extensively, particularly in first half.\n",
        "The on-screen carnage established a new level in American movies, but few of the films that followed in its wake could duplicate Peckinpah's depth of feeling.\n",
        "In purely cinematic terms, the film is a savagely beautiful spectacle, Lucien Ballard's superb cinematography complementing Peckinpah's darkly elegiac vision.\n",
        "The Wild Bunch takes the basic elements of the Western movie myth, which once defined a simple, morally comprehensible world, and by bending them turns them into symbols of futility and aimless corruption.\n",
        "A true cinematic touchstone, the film has influenced a generation of movie makers, from Scorsese to Tarantino to Hong Kong action king John Woo.\n",
        "Seeing this restored version is like understanding the film at last.\n",
        "The director was one of the very few filmmakers who could create a world that, however nastier or more brutish than the one we live in, never felt smaller or less complex.\n",
        "Not only does The Wild Bunch illustrate Peckinpah's mastery of his medium, but it presents a story that is effective on nearly every level.\n",
        "If you wanted to introduce someone to what jazz is all about, this would be an ideal place to start.\n",
        "For non-buffs, pic fails the acid test of exciting interest where there was little or none before; it could easily have covered the same ground in half its length.\n",
        "A wonderful, warm little movie.\n",
        "Monumental.\n",
        "Anyone with the misconception that the spirit of a particular music is not a direct reflection of the souls of the musicians who created it must see A Great Day in Harlem, Jean Bach's small and very moving documentary about the jazz life.\n",
        "It's a funny and moving film whose swinging rhythms and informal tone capture a feeling for the music, the people who make it and the affection and respect they feel for each other and the art form.\n",
        "If there's such a thing as a magical documentary, A Great Day in Harlem is it.\n",
        "One Fine Day is two formulaic hours, but they do illustrate how two attractive leads and a lickety-split narrative can elevate meager material into something this side of bearability.\n",
        "Fargo, with its grotesque murders and cheery detectives, is a cold gem that takes us to the far north. Its seemingly pitiless light opens up the realms of darkness concealed beneath that world of white.\n",
        "A small, supremely satisfying film. Heck and you betcha, it is.\n",
        "A few scenes go around in circles, as if snow-blind, and the humor may be too inward and contorted for some tastes. But McDormand brings order to the weirdness and warms it up.\n",
        "It's another daring black comedy by one of the most consistently inventive moviemaking teams of the last decade, brothers Joel and Ethan Coen.\n",
        "From the camera angles to the set design, everything is calculated to make the viewer feel superior to the cloddish, geeky characters on display.\n",
        "In the fascinating Fargo, writer-director Joel and writer-producer Ethan have come up with a film that is either an oddly funny crime drama or an ultra-deadpan comedy, depending on how you look at it.\n",
        "Fargo is a strikingly mature, uniqueentertainment that plays on many levels ... all satisfying.\n",
        "The Coens remain effortlessly ahead of the American field.\n",
        "Gunderson (Frances McDormand) [is] the most endearing, hilarious and wholly feminine heroine since Thelma or Louise.\n",
        "Chief Gunderson was created by the Coens specifically for Frances McDormand ... and they've been rewarded by a brilliant and unblinking comic performance.\n",
        "It's easy to admire what the Coens are trying to do in Fargo, but more difficult to actually like the film.\n",
        "With Fargo, Joel and Ethan Coen return to the glory days of 1987 and Raising Arizona.\n",
        "Uniquely fascinating.\n",
        "Has a murder mystery, a heist gone wrong, tragedy, comedy, and well flushed out characters that are both simple and complex at the same time.\n",
        "Fargo has been hauntingly photographed by Roger Deakins with great, expressive use of white-outs that sometimes make the characters appear to be moving through a dream.\n",
        "Whether these characters are lovable or detestable, they're lovable or detestable in a TV way -- defined by a minimal set of traits that are endlessly reiterated and incapable of expansion or alteration, a fixed loop.\n",
        "Kidnapping, larceny and murder have seldom been funnier than in Fargo.\n",
        "Like every other critic I'm aware of, I loved this movie.\n",
        "To watch it is to experience steadily mounting delight, as you realize the filmmakers have taken enormous risks, gotten away with them and made a movie that is completely original, and as familiar as an old shoe.\n",
        "This mordant, macabre look at the American obsession with fast food, television and murder is icily funny.\n",
        "The tone is ideal for a family audience. The length is perfect. And the sequence of last-minute surprises elicits tears and laughter in just the right proportions.\n",
        "Wee urbanites might find Disney's scorn for city life a shade offputting, but if preview audiences are any indication, little ones will laugh their tiny heinies off at the humor herein.\n",
        "The first movie was good-hearted and I liked it, but since then Babe has raised the bar, with animals that not only talk more realistically, but say things that are wittier and more pungent.\n",
        "It does a better job than most family films in projecting a child's-eye view of a world where siblings and pets are equally cherished members of the family.\n",
        "Taken on its own entirely hokey terms, Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco is a charming romp of a talking animal movie.\n",
        "It's more padded than Lassie's bed. But 9-and-unders were having a tail-wagging good time.\n",
        "Initial segments have a boisterous blend of dynamic graphics, intriguing plot premises and sly wit that unfortunately slide gradually downhill.\n",
        "Some of the animation is first-rate, particularly in the more modest comedy segments, and even the heavy set pieces have greater flash and dazzle than anything Ralph Bakshi mustered around the same period.\n",
        "Fantasies that are gratuitously sexist and Fascist (macho whoring and warmongering), and whose roots reach all the way back to post-hippie paranoia, feed the tangled plot-lines of a movie that... should disappoint even the teenage wet-dreamers.\n",
        "Heavy Metal has been animated with great verve, and scored very well, with music much less ear-splitting than the title would suggest.\n",
        "Regardless of its dated stylishness (which still holds up remarkably well a decade plus later), Heavy Metal was a pioneering film in 1981 and remains a pivitol and infuential body of art today.\n",
        "Asked if I wanted to see it again, I figured, why not? I would have remembered if it was really bad. But memory does play tricks.\n",
        "Except for the most undiscriminating gorehound, pic is a pointless mess.\n",
        "The animals' exuberance is so infectious and their \"acting\" so true to human life that by the fadeout The Aristocats does, indeed, give the audience paws for reflection.\n",
        "This 1970 animated feature is dull, careless, and all too typical of the Disney studio's slapdash output before the unexpected renaissance of The Rescuers.\n",
        "Helped immeasurably by the voices of Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Sterling Holloway, Scatman Crothers and others, plus some outstanding animation, songs, sentiment, some excellent dialog and even a touch of psychedelia.\n",
        "Purr-fect.\n",
        "The real beauty of the picture, which is as amusing, smoothly machined and beautifully colored as any Disney should be, is in the characterizations, sustained within a sprightly but simple format.\n",
        "Though The Flower of My Secret is a slight work, it is a pleasing return to form.\n",
        "The movie is full of familiar Almodovar fare, but it feels freshened.\n",
        "An intimate, beautifully wrought work, it reflects a new maturity in Almodovar's work and is one of his best pictures.\n",
        "It's a witty, intelligent scramble, and it's beautifully mounted.\n",
        "Likely to be disappointing to Almodovar's admirers, and inexplicable to anyone else.\n",
        "If Leo appears to be doing some more or less orthodox movie-style suffering -- crying jags, a suicide attempt and the like -- perhaps that's just what she's supposed to be doing.\n",
        "Secret isn't the usual romp, but it's Almodovar's most committed work in years.\n",
        "Though Almodovar touches on many of his favorite absurdities, he does so with surprising subtlety.\n",
        "It slowly unfolds from a narrow satire into a romance that's rich with real-life bitterness.\n",
        "It's bland as often as it is affecting, and presents little that's new or original.\n",
        "One of those intriguing films that functions without a plot, and uses instead an intense curiosity about its characters.\n",
        "This mix of sitcomsitcom antics and romantic melodrama involving a couple who meet through a sperm donation is a complete misfire...\n",
        "Sluggishly paced and too seldom funny...\n",
        "The script lacks wit and depth, while Lawrence's direction is meandering and undramatic, full of showy, over-elaborate camera movements.\n",
        "Too serious to be a comedy, too flippant to be a thriller, it often feels like a backhanded act of penance for the misogynist humor in the star's comedy act.\n",
        "[Lawrence is] a charming, gifted comic with a killer smile, but he's way out of his depth in this Fatal Attraction knockoff, which he also co-wrote and stars in.\n",
        "The screenplay is credited to four writers, and its unevenness argues that none of them were on the same wavelength.\n",
        "A Thin Line Between Love and Hate takes its name from the Persuaders 1971 hit that has been re-recorded by the Pretenders, Annie Lennox and H-Town. You could have just as much fun simply playing one of them and skipping the movie.\n",
        "As a forum for its actors and for the big-screen directorial debut of multi-Emmy winner Gregory Hoblit, the film is up to the job.\n",
        "Tries to incorporate almost film-noir elements into a heartland love story. The blending feels inorganic; and composer Bruce Broughton doesn't help matters by coating every moment with a repetitive, syrupy theme.\n",
        "An earnestly well-meaning film whose adult characters have a refreshingly grown-up perspective on their choices in life.\n",
        "Everyone in the film -- even the teenager -- is more intelligent and articulate than is usually permitted in American movies, and having gotten themselves into an emotional tangle, they go to work getting themselves out again.\n",
        "Think Dennis Hopper has played too many crazies? Well, you'll wish he'd stuck to blowing up buses after you see him in Carried Away.\n",
        "Carried Away is erotic, but it's also thoughtful and intelligent, and, coupled with Hopper's extraordinary performance, that's reason enough to be carried away by this motion picture.\n",
        "A minor but quirkily charming comedy about alientaion, love, and folly that reflects the zeitgeist in terms of AIDS and modern technology.\n",
        "Salwen has captured and properly identified a very particular modern American species. His emergence as a filmmaker is a true event.\n",
        "At only 80 minutes, it doesn't overstay its welcome, but slight though it may be, it knows how to create constant smiles.\n",
        "It's hard to care about a movie story in which the characters never meet one another or really care about one another.\n",
        "After a while, besides enjoying the stories as such, we begin to enjoy the film's trickiness, almost all on the phone, as a sort of high-wire act.\n",
        "Doesn't go much past its gimmick, but it marks Salwen as a talent worth watching.\n",
        "Might have been more effective if the writer/director had taken the time to create characters imbued with more than token traces of humanity.\n",
        "Too slight to be a cautionary fable and not light enough to merit the term 'goofy caper.' But it sits in an enjoyable place of its own.\n",
        "It's likely to be overrated by some and underrated by others, and both contingents will be wrong. One can't, however, overrate the performances, with auntie ruling the roost in more ways than one.\n",
        "Though Martin and a solid supporting cast produce a few scattered moments of near-hilarity, for the most part the terrain here is as flat as it gets.\n",
        "[A] celebration of high jinks.\n",
        "This is shoddy hackwork, replaying classic scenarios (the honest new recruit, audits by Pentagon bigwigs and manoeuvres in Nevada) with such disregard for narrative structure the reels might be in the wrong order.\n",
        "The film is full of gratifying gags like these, but it also has to strain for newly enlarged scope.\n",
        "Wacky is just the right tone for a spring comedy.\n",
        "One of the pleasures of the movie is all the little jokes hidden in the corners.\n",
        "Director Jonathan Lynn has had his hits (My Cousin Vinny) and stinkeroos (Greedy). This falls in between.\n",
        "Martin's aggrieved expressions and sublime physical bits are constantly entertaining.\n",
        "This Sgt. Bilko should be court-martialed.\n",
        "[Randle] holds the film together as best she can with her luminous presence and dignity, but can't supply the lacking subtext, past history and motivation.\n",
        "There's something refreshing about the film's reckless proximity to anarchy, the stylishly imaginative cinematography and lusciously exorbitant Prince soundtrack, even if it does ring hollow when Lee tries to get serious on us.\n",
        "Lee's never been too hip to women's perspectives, and in Girl 6, he proves that marriage, maturity and 10 years of filmmaking haven't substantially corrected his blind spot.\n",
        "Lee has done the impossible: He's sucked the fun out of call-in sex and replaced it with sanctimonious prattle.\n",
        "While Lee is a skillful director, he's also more coldly analytical than emotional, and it is not his style to get us to feel for this woman as much as we should.\n",
        "Lee draws his lines between fantasy and reality without much confidence and with only a sketchy logic.\n",
        "Lee may have a keen sense of setting and dialogue, but his characterization is off."

        "Instead of effervescent and mercurial, the movie is simply muddled. What happened?\n",
        "Mr. Lee isn't as successful at shaping a story around Girl 6, but enjoying her company is all his slender, sunny film really tries to do.\n",
        "Strongly told stories have a way of carrying their characters along with them. But here we have an undefined character in an aimless story. Too bad.\n",
        "The husband is still a brute, and the swimming pool is still moldy, but the new Diabolique fails to translate into anything more than the latest ham-handed Hollywood makeover of a European classic.\n",

        "Writer-director Sautet's great achievement is to introduce a world of undefinable impulses; the two actors' great achievement is to step into that world and experience them.\n",
        "It glows with sorrowful humor in its look at two people who seem just right for each other but don't have time on their side.\n",
        "With a fine appreciation for the nuances of polite repression, Sautet makes a quiet, careful study of these two lonely people.\n",
        "It's one sign of Sautet's success that, though he presents neither character as especially admirable or exceptional, he makes us care about them a great deal.\n",
        "It's reserved, polished and challengingly intelligent.\n",
        "It is a matter of great erotic fascination when two people are intrigued by the notion of becoming lovers, but are held back by the fear of rejection _and_ the fear of involvement.\n",
        "These are two great actors giving top-notch performances, and the restrained romance they project is fascinating.\n",
        "A carefully conceived, dramatically honorable picture that treats its subject with clarity and intelligence, especially by contemporary standards.\n",
        "As the detective-story flashback structure gets under way, what initially seemed adherence to dramatic and moral cliche becomes more complex and interesting.\n",
        "Despite its underlying predictability, Courage Under Fire manages warmth, intelligence and a healthy share of surprises.\n",
        "I wasn't particularly moved or riveted with suspense.\n",
        "A fascinating mystery mixed with war action.\n",
        "At the end of Courage Under Fire, you feel torn between admiration and annoyance with the filmmakers, who take an attention-grabbing premise and skillfully develop it into a conclusion that's pure piffle.\n",
        "Courage Under Fire honors its subject and its audience.\n",
        "While its re-creation of combat is not Courage Under Fire's most involving aspect, the film succeeds in making the Gulf War seem more of a real event than all the footage shipped back on CNN could.\n",
        "A downright entertaining combo or mystery, melodrama and action adventure.\n",
        "The end of the film understandably lays on the emotion a little heavily, but until then Courage Under Fire has been a fascinating emotional and logistical puzzle.\n",
        "Steven Rosenblum's editing is excellent, smoothly uniting present and past, articulating individual scenes alertly.\n",
        "Part Rashomon, part The Caine Mutiny, the first major-studio film to deal with 1991's Desert Storm not only captures the terror of battle but also its wrenching aftermath.\n",
        "Courage Under Fire is as profound and intelligent as it is moving, and that makes this memorable motion picture one of 1996's best.\n",
        "...this snappy installment is a marked improvement over John Woo's surprisingly dull sequel, though the set pieces lack the elegance and visual coherence of the Brian de Palma original.\n",

        "There are no flourishes to savor. Instead, there are big-deal stunts.\n",
        "The grand finale? A fistfight, after which somebody gets run over. Listen, if I want to see that kind of action, I don't go to Shanghai. I don't even go to the movies. I go to the South Bronx and stand outside a bar.\n",
        "The best of the three.\n",
        "Abrams knows how to frame a shot and how to propulsively push both action and love stories, but logic continues to elude him as much as it did De Palma and Woo.\n",

        "Mission: Impossible III provides lots of action, but too little excitement.\n",
        "Although he slams into stationary objects with his customary zeal, Tom Cruise is off his game here, sabotaged by a misguided attempt to shade his character with gray.\n",
        "It's an expertly engineered popcorn movie -- hold the butter substitute -- but it also tries (and fails) to be a love story for the ages.\n",

        "A down-the-line thriller, plain, fast and efficient.\n",
        "The movie's story is nothing to write home about. It's pretty routine. What makes the movie special is how it's made. Nolte and Murphy are good, and their dialogue is good, too -- quirky and funny.\n",
        "[It] is more memorable for its characters than for its high style, more a series of energetic scenes than a collection of handsome imagery. It has life, ferocity and humor in place of icy, stylized elegance, and that seems more than a fair trade.\n",
        "It's Delon -- impossibly beautiful, impossible to read, cold, cool -- who steals the film.\n",
        "Rene Clement's subversive direction makes us root for Delon to pull off a tricky tightrope disguise as suspicious police pursue him from hotel to apartment and town to town.\n",

        "August Rush will not be for everyone, but it works if you surrender to its lilting and unabashedly sentimental tale of evocative music and visual poetry.\n",
        "Exuberantly bad and strenuously preposterous.\n",
        "Intended as a fuzzy family fable, August plays more to the gag reflex than to the heart.\n",
        "If it isn't brilliant cinema, it's honest and powerful.\n",
        "[An] inane musical melodrama.\n",
        "It would be nice to say this predictable fantasy has such a big heart, we can forgive its excesses. But director Kirsten Sheridan overplays nearly every already-corny scene.\n",
        "August Rush feels like the cinematic equivalent of being stuffed with fruitcake and doused with a gallon of egg nog.\n",
        "The goal is to drive mothers everywhere insane with the urge to rescue him and brush his hair (or the other way around), and in my case it worked.\n",
        "It's hard to believe in the magical power of music to heal and connect lost souls when the tunes are lame.\n",
        "Director Kirsten Sheridan has no interest in keeping August Rush tethered to reality or toning down the sentimentality.\n",
        "It tries very hard to be fanciful, lyrical, sentimental, magical, rapturous, romantic, heartwarming, tear-jerking and inspiring. The result, however, is a goulash of half-baked bathos.\n",
        "I dislike sentimentality where it doesn't belong, but there's something brave about the way August Rush declares itself and goes all the way with coincidence, melodrama and skillful tear-jerking.\n",
        "An exercise in dissonance.\n",
        "If August Rush is a fairy tale, it's an excruciatingly, sometimes hilariously oblivious one.\n",
        "As a tribute to the cranky genius of Dahl, it's both fond and, in the best sense, fruitful.\n",

        "James and the Giant Peach proves the best effects are even better with a strong story.\n",
        "At its lyrical best, James and the Giant Peach, an adaptation of Roald Dahl's 1961 children's classic, evokes the casual enchantment of a book that, for many kids (including me), cast the spell of a goofily blissed-out mirage.\n",
        "We fully anticipate the wrath of several generations of possessive children when we declare that the new Disney film of James and the Giant Peach is an improvement on Roald Dahl's 1961 backyard fantasy.\n",

        "The latest in an impressive string of first-rate movies for kids.\n",
        "Despite a lightness of plot, it most beautifully captures the book's free-floating, fantastic sense of adventure and wonder.\n",
        "James and the Giant Peach is frequently so alluring that viewers may feel the urge to get lost in the picture's curious shadings, intricate merriment and fantastical atmosphere.\n",
        "In general the magic as well as the heart of Roald Dahl's novel has remained stubbornly on the page, leaving us with this overly mechanical copy, as appetizing as a once-flavorful peach that's been in cold storage for far too long.\n",
        "This weird story has been transformed into a playful, visually arresting experience with more than a few allusions to The Wizard of Oz.\n",
        "It's ripe to bursting with visual effects a heady combination of stop-motion and computer-generated imagery.\n",
        "James and the Giant Peach, the latest animated film from Disney, is a technological marvel, arch and innovative with a daringly offbeat visual conception. But it's also a strenuously artful film with a macabre edge that may scare small children.\n",
        "A stunner with a breathtaking array of eye-teasers.\n",
        "It will, I think, entertain kids for whom stop-motion animation is the last thing they're thinking about.\n",
        "For a while, the cast is appealing enough, and the design is House Beautiful enough, to camouflage the Fatal flaws that turn the second half into an overblown, predictable snicker-fest.\n",
        "The ensemble is assured and adroitly gets the gags across without telegraphing punch lines.\n",
        "A twisted comedy for twisted times, this movie made me happy. Go figure.\n",
        "A quintet of Canadian TV comedians hit the cinema screen with a splat.\n",
        "A splendid showcase for their diverse, frisky talents.\n",
        "[A] shrill and slovenly opus.\n",
        "Isn't anything more than a sloppy showcase for the group's costume-changing tricks, but sometimes its sheer chutzpah can be amusing.\n",

        "Reader, I did not laugh.\n",
        "If I had Diabolique and Faithful in theaters simultaneously, I'd hire a hit man to take myself out.\n",

        "Feverish, whimsical allegory elevated by moments of brilliant clarity.\n",
        "The film can be both frenetic and strained. But it also has has a great deal of power and can be quite haunting.\n",
        "It is a pastoral poem dappled with the play of brilliant images and strong, dark feelings, a luminous revelation of Indian life in language that all the world can understand.\n",
        "Satyajit Ray's beautiful first feature.\n",
        "Film justly won the 'most human document award' at the 1956 Cannes Film Fest, unveiling a mature film talent in director Satyajit Ray.\n",
        "A masterpiece, inarguably.\n",
        "There are lovely little threads in the strange fabric. It's a film that takes patience to be enjoyed.\n",
        "The great, sad, gentle sweep of The Apu Trilogy remains in the mind of the moviegoer as a promise of what film can be.\n",
        "One of the legendary debuts in the history of film -- deservedly so.\n",
        "This is the kind of motion picture that will stay with you for hours, or perhaps even days, after you've left the theater, and that's a rare characteristic for any movie.\n",
        "The World of Apu completes, in alternations of suffering and joy, one of the most vital and abundant movies ever made.\n",
        "Great acting, remarkable use of locations, a humanistic ethos that's both wise and wary.\n",
        "Director Satyajit Ray, with greater technical means, makes the truth of his relationships and the revelation of India the main trumps of the film. Wit, tenderness and intrinsic human revelations illuminate this unusual film.\n",
        "Though the rhythm of the storytelling is choppy and Apu himself seems incompletely realized, the first appearance of the remarkable Sharmila Tagore as his well-to-do bride upgrades the film's middle section.\n",
        "An impressive capstone is put not only upon a touching human drama but also upon the development of a genuine artist's skill.\n",
        "What we sense all through The Apu Trilogy is a different kind of life than we are used to.\n",
        "The Apu Trilogy, 36 years after its completion, remains one of the screen's great gifts.\n",
        "The 'Apu Trilogy' is a true masterpiece, and The World of Apu is its crown jewel.\n",
        "[The wisecracks], more often than not, don't go over. But those that do still add up to lotsa laughs, and the sheer weight of them eventually builds an atmosphere of mild lunacy that it's useless to resist.\n",
        "So, how does movie differ from TV show? The answer is, thankfully, not a lot.\n",
        "Helping to make these pleasantries funny is their spur-of-the-moment quality, the same quick spontaneity that characterizes chance remarks overheard at raucous movie houses. Capturing that bright and unexpected quality is what the MST3K crew does best.\n",
        "[It's] is a tough call to recommend for everyone. But for a goofy time laughing at stupid comedy with otherwise intelligent people, it might be just the ticket.\n",
        "I guess there are some concepts that don't excel in the translation from the small screen to the big one.\n",
        "The illusion that it's just a bunch of wiseguys making fun of a movie is what prevails. It's a pretty impressive special effect.\n",
        "One of the film's more likable aspects is its certainty that nothing's sacred.\n",
        "From the opening spoof of 2001: A Space Odyssey to the end-credit yuks, MST3K:TM seizes your funny bone like a rabid mongoose and never lets go.\n",
        "Part of the appeal of the program is in the wisecracking. But the movies themselves are also crucial.\n",
        "They've hit a fatal snag. The feature they selected happens to be a pretty good one -- certainly much better than Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie by just about any criterion one could think of.\n",
        "A flat-out hilarious celebration of B-moviemaking mastery.\n",
        "Simpler and cruder than Who Framed Roger Rabbit in terms of story and technique, this is still a great deal of fun, confirming that Jordan is every bit as mythological a creature as Daffy Duck or Yosemite Sam.\n",
        "Cute, rambunctious, generally amusing rather than outright funny, this clever mix of live action, highlighted by the unequaled skills of basketball superstar Michael Jordan, and animated Looney Tunes antics will be a must-see for kids.\n",
        "Sufferin' succotash!\n",
        "Visually, it's a mess: the attempts to blend 2- and 3-D animation with live-action and computer-generated images produce scenes that are fuzzier than the storyline.\n",
        "This film was made very quickly by animation standards, and the haste shows.\n",
        "It's the first time either Jordan or Bugs has had a starring role on the big screen. It's gimmicky Saturday-morning cartoon wackiness in your face -- funny, but brain-deadening.\n",
        "Space Jam is no Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but it works well enough.\n",
        "This movie, which could just as easily be called The Michael Jordan Worship Show, plays like a 90-minute homage to His Airness, selling his every virtue.\n",
        "It's an inspired way to use, and kid, Jordan's image while at the same time updating Bugs Bunny & Company to doing battle in the multizillion-dollar animation sweepstakes.\n",
        "In basketball terms, Space Jam is more akin to the 'garbage time' that concludes lopsided games, when reckless playing is no substitute for the real thing.\n",
        "The movie's undermining flaw is its lack of screen magic (and first-rate cartoon gags) that Who Framed Roger Rabbit had throughout.\n",
        "The climactic game in Space Jam goes slack repeatedly.\n",
        "Jordan has immense likability, and his extraordinary talents need no further adulation.\n",
        "This chronicle of a person with AIDS who decides to terminate his life while his faculties are still intact feels like a personal work, but it's all background detail, lacking a strong dramatic core\n",
        "This Party has its funny, sad and awkward moments. But at the end, you'll be glad you went.\n",
        "Photographed by the great Russell Boyd but looking drab and washed out for 108 minutes, the movie just gets by on heart and a conversation-stopping finale.\n",
        "Director Margarethe von Trotta effortlessly weaves history and personal events into a tapestry full of emotion and irony.\n",
        "For a Cinderella story, it's sorely without magic.\n",
        "The brazen sentimentality at work here -- while effective in the context of what some might call \"a chick flick\"-- doesn't give the material much weight.\n",
        "Lake is a rather chilly and distinctly unpersuasive presence.\n",
        "This film mistakes action for energy, ridiculous circumstances for comedy, and a mismatched male/female pairing for romance.\n",
        "A watered-down star vehicle for chat queen Ricki Lake, the comedy lite has been flicked on none too delicately by director Richard Benjamin.\n",
        "This is more of a movie to see on video, on an empty night when you need something to hurl at the gloom.\n",
        "A straight romantic comedy that depends on Lake's charm and acting ability to keep it afloat. The result is disaster.\n",
        "The plot remains joyless in its contrivances.\n",

        "These escapist showdown movies are only as good as their villains and heroes. The heavies here are more of those ubiquitous gung-ho military types who are due to be dishonorably discharged from further cinematic duty.\n",
        "Here's a surprise tucked into the languishing days of summer movies. Arriving with hardly any attention is a satisfying, even fun, action picture about a futuristic soldier named Solo.\n",
        "Solo is at least instructive as a miscellany of action movie cliches in one neat and depressing package.\n",
        "The best one can say for Norberto Barba is that he directs a slick piece of goods. But no amount of fast cutting or tempo can disguise the material's simplistic, thoughtless nature.\n",
        "Since filmgoers are told early on that there is only one other super-cyborg prototype in the world, well, guess what the big climax is?\n",
        "A lackluster action-adventure.\n",
        "Not one fight is memorable, and the set looks recycled from an Indiana Jones theme park.\n",
        "For what it is, a straightforward sci-fi action movie with an equally straightforward hero, Solo works.\n",
        "As movie androids go, Solo is a softie, and that's his problem.\n",
        "It's all painfully formulaic.\n",
        "Soloflex might be a better title.\n",
        "There's a sense of shrewd observation throughout The Substitute that makes it come alive and seem quite a few cuts above such usual genre fare.\n",
        "Aside from a lot of only moderately-satisfying violence, The Substitute comes across as rather lame.\n",
        "Those who appreciate the irony of a killing machine turned loose on a pack of nasty students will find The Substitute a source of nonstop delight.\n",
        "The title changes, the actors change, and the superficial details of the story change, but it is always about exactly the same thing: heavily armed men shooting at one another.\n",
        "The entire setup is too garish to be credible.\n",
        "There's a certain amount of camp value to this over-the-top thriller, which might as well be called Rambo Goes to High School.\n",
        "An angry, white, mercenary movie out to spill blood and beat its manly chest.\n",
        "Everything in and about Baigelman's debut is irritatingly derivative: second-hand plot, small-time characters, limited and movieish vision, and bad performances for Reeves and Diaz.\n",
        "The film lacks the wit and drama that might pitch it beyond the target demographic, though judging from what makes the girls squirm in the film, it might not succeed even there.\n",
        "A good-natured bundle of early-teen femme angst pitched squarely at the youngsters who've made Louise Rennison's books a hit both sides of the Pond.\n",
        "[A] gorgeously shot, repetitively violent, occasionally repellent, sometimes silly and consistently trashy fantasy.\n",
        "For all its fiery explosions, Face/Off just kind of implodes.\n",
        "It's sick, slick and sensational.\n",
        "In Face/Off, Woo sweeps us away again, into a world of wild action, heroism, villainy and double faces that turn deadly.\n",
        "A knockout new thriller by John Woo.\n",
        "Face/Off is a full-blooded, movie-going experience. It's 100 percent movie.\n",
        "Face/Off is the best action movie of the summer.\n",
        "Almost indefensibly violent, the film is one of those whirligigs of wit, barbaric energy, blood spatters and firepower that will be adored by the morally retarded among us -- like me -- and loathed by the morally superior.\n",
        "Face/Off makes bad movies look worse and makes the making of good movies look like the most thrilling work in the world.\n",
        "Woo's poetic-kinetic style has evolved, if not to the point of abstraction, then to delirium: he makes a virtue of incredulity.\n",
        "John Woo's Face/Off puts the acting into action flick...\n",
        "Scenes of high-voltage action vie with wild hilarity as two guys with guns switch faces and identities.\n",
        "It's difficult to describe the jolt his films deliver when [Woo]'s on, and he is on with a vengeance here.\n",
        "Watching John Travolta and Nicolas Cage square off and literally exchange roles brings back the old-fashioned pleasure of astutely judged movie star pairings in a major way.\n",
        "Here comes a mega-movie that actually delivers what mega-movies promise...\n",
        "You see what thickets this plot constructs; it's as if Travolta adds the spin courtesy of Cage's personality, while Cage mellows in the direction of Travolta.\n",
        "A dizzying, beautiful ride.\n",
        "If there has been a major Hollywood release with a higher body count, I don't remember it.\n",
        "capable of moments of rare cinematic perfection\n",
        "It makes us feel sympathy for the devil.\n",
        "Director John Crowley, a veteran Irish theater director now working in film, is deliberate with every last element of his film.\n",
        "Even its structurally weaker moments give Garfield an opportunity to expand on Jack's physical and mental dislocation. Given Boy A's final floating reel, it's an anchoring performance in every sense of the word.\n",
        "The movie is taut with suspense but culminates in wise resignation as the hero comes to understand he's running from a part of himself.\n",
        "Crowley gets a remarkable performance from Andrew Garfield: his Jack is a person who carries guilt with him even when he is trying to override it.\n",
        "Boy A is one of those rare movies that takes the idea of rehabilitation seriously. In the end, it may present a worst-case scenario, but it does so with unusual depth and conviction.\n",
        "In tandem, the director and screenwriter build up a palpable suspense. Boy A will rivet you while raising issues about forgiveness and just who deserves it.\n",
        "Along with Garfield and the splendid Scottish actor Mullan, Crowley brings great tact to this bruising saga of atonement and moral regeneration. Though a bad seed can bring forth good fruit, will others want to pick it?\n",
        "There are some gaps in the movie's reality, and some O. Henry-like contrivances, but the masterful trick Boy A plays on viewers is to get them to care before giving them reasons not to.\n",
        "We're introduced to more string-pulling symbolism than a movie this inherently sad ever needs. It's too much.\n",
        "Mullen and Garfield fit well together -- both have faces you like on first sight, both have charm, both have warmth.\n",
        "Although the screenplay tips our sympathies wholly in the young man's direction, it's cleverly structured to reveal the particulars of the long-ago crime, and what led up to it, in flashback.\n",
        "Bleak but expertly rendered.\n",
        "A small, huge film about the harsh realities of rehabilitation, and the shimmering possibility of redemption.\n",
        "If Hitchcock had done a coming-of-age drama, it might have resembled this haunting, nervous, sad movie.\n",
        "An absorbing, finely nuanced morality tale.\n",
        "Wisely, John Crowley embeds the mulling of social issues within a character study, albeit one that stylistically straddles Loachian realism and lad-movie flashiness.\n",
        "Crowley, his cast and the script constantly reveal new layers to the characters, preventing simple labels like 'hero' or 'villain.' These people are all cringingly human.\n",
        "Effects and production design are splendidly integrated into the overall enterprise, which is even more enjoyable for being so unexpected.\n",
        "Boldly going where few parodies have gone before.\n",
        "The drolleries take precedence over the special effects.\n",
        "A sweet-spirited and clever film for anyone who's ever been a sci-fi nerd -- or laughed at one.\n",
        "The movie's cast is delightful.\n",
        "An amiable comedy that simultaneously manages to spoof these popular futuristic space adventures and replicate the very elements that have made them so durable.\n",
        "It's a clever premise but not one that lends itself to an hour and 42 minutes of high jinks.\n",
        "In many ways, Galaxy Quest is more fantasy than science fiction. It's a lighthearted romp.\n",
        "This movie is more than one joke or one idea. It's a thoroughly satisfying comedy -- and a respectable space adventure, as well.\n",
        "For fans of science fiction Galaxy Quest is a sweet, funny valentine to their obsessiveness.\n",
        "Spaceballs meets the Six Clueless Samurai.\n",
        "The film's warm-fuzzies are formulaic and not at all genuine. The humor, though, is clever and keenly satiric without being mean-spirited.\n",
        "The movie's humor works best when the illogic of the TV show gets in the way.\n",
        "It'll beam you way, way up.\n",
        "A big, dumb piece of fun that will do little for your heart or intellect, but will undoubtedly leave you laughing.\n",
        "Fast, light and funny, Galaxy Quest has a wide, generation - spanning appeal -- and you don't have to be a die-hard Trekkie to enjoy it.\n",
        "Affectionate, often clever and unflaggingly funny!\n",
        "Galaxy Quest has both a story and a back story, which is rare for this kind of romp.\n",
        "Though its romantic-comedy triangle borrows heavily from Cyrano de Bergerac, the film has more in common with Three's Company.\n",
        "The animation is fairly unexciting though serviceable, and the overall mystification of class difference would probably have made Dickens shudder, but kids should find this tolerable enough.\n",
        "Even as a cartoon poodle, Bette Midler stops the show.\n",
        "Much cornball adventure ensues, punctuated by healthy helpings of singing, dancing and general merriment.\n",
        "The film offers a fanciful, lush urban setting, unusual for Disney animated features, and a couple of good songs.\n",
        "Despite three screenwriters and 13 names credited for the story, the script quickly sinks into a predictable 'girl-meets-pet, girl-loses-pet, girl-and -pet-reunite' sap-trap.\n",
        "Take the kids. Have fun.\n",
        "An uneven but largely likable basketball-themed comedy.\n",
        "The outcome is deeply unsatisfying.\n",
        "This is a bad time for NBA fans in Boston. Just as their beloved Celtics are about to wrap up a dismal season, with nearly 50 losses and no berth in the playoffs, Hollywood comes out with a comedy about the Celtics that's even worse than the team.\n",
        "Not only is the picture woefully short on laughs, it's also coarse, overbearing and, in places, downright insulting.\n",
        "You don't even have to be a Celtics fan to appreciate it. In fact, considering who becomes the butt of the film's ultimate joke, perhaps it's best if you're not one.\n",
        "Celtic Pride has ingredients that could have made for a tough knockabout farce. Unfortunately, the film, directed by Tom De Cerchio from a screenplay by Judd Apatow, doesn't know the meaning of the term 'light touch.'\n",
        "Does De Cerchio have a future at Disney or what?\n",
        "Flipper is inoffensive, but it's also asleep in the deep.\n",
        "La Captive is so good that it makes amends for A Couch in New York, Akerman's simply dreadful 1996 English-language love story.\n",
        "Coy to a fault, the movie collapses under its own weight with 90 minutes to go, despite Robby MAuller's impressive black-and-white photography, which puts the film on a higher artistic plane than other equally unbearable movies.\n",
        "Production values count for something, and it's a good thing, too, because this French period piece takes two hours and then some to reach its conclusion without reaching even a trot.\n",
        "The acting is so bad that apparently none of the performers ever got another job in the movies, and the costumes in Ben Hur seem less dated that those on display here.\n",
        "A terrific example of efficient, resourceful filmmaking, and its depiction of urban ills is, if anything, all too prophetic.\n",
        "To watch Switchblade Sisters is to visit a never-never land of shopworn media images colliding in a tabloid high school of the mind.\n",
        "Sublime, exploitative camp.\n",
        "Just good enough to make it understandable why someone else might really like it. And it's just bad enough to make you wonder about such a person.\n",
        "Badly acted, written and directed.\n",
        "A 1975 exploitation dud, this is the kind of movie Cinemax screens late at night. It's not just bad, it's execrable.\n",
        "More Kafkaesque than comedic, more fascinating to watch than out-and-out funny.\n",
        "Although Multiplicity is funny, it's not as heartwarming or inventive as Groundhog Day.\n",
        "The comedy itself, however, is uneven and, more often than not, obvious.\n",
        "Keaton does a dandy job by his four Dougs, but the problem is a script that assumes a physical comedian can do it all, including twisting characters to make them fit the plot line. It doesn't work.\n",
        "Director Harold Ramis had more serious ambitions. Multiplicity should have been another Groundhog Day, which Ramis also directed, but he comes up short.\n",
        "Ramis and his quartet of writers, including City Slickers shtick factories of Lowell Ganz & Babaloo Mandel, can't find much to do with their simple premise.\n",
        "A buoyant domestic farce.\n",
        "Multiplicity cheats itself by not letting its imagination run as wild as its star.\n",
        "Groundhog Day had a certain sweetness and even a sly philosophical depth, but Multiplicity is more of a ground-level comedy, in which we can usually anticipate the problems for Doug and his clones.\n",
        "Multiplicity exists because it's now possible for an actor to appear on screen with himself and not by means of anything so quaint as double exposure.\n",
        "I recommend this to anyone who wants to see a solipsistic comedy about the darker side of marriage.\n",
        "Fleming's film begins promisingly as a black comedy a la Heathers, but then quickly succumbs to its machinery of special effects; this is yet another bad picture in a long list of Hollywood flops about witchcraft.\n",
        "If only The Craft were as fresh as its enchanting lead quartet.\n",
        "As satire, Hype dares to play the race card but folds too soon.\n",
        "Schelsinger's masterfully directed eccentric satire is based on Stella Gibbons' 1933 book which spoofs the serious, soul-searching, rural-set stories of writers like D.H. Lawrence and Mary Webb.\n",
        "Dickens meets the Beverly Hillbillies.\n",
        "[A] bayou slog.\n",
        "The yarn has its share of gaping holes and jaw-dropping improbabilities, but director Michael Bay sweeps them all aside with his never-take-a-breath pacing.\n",
        "Slick, brutal and almost human, this is the team-spirit action movie Mission: Impossible should have been.\n",
        "Fake countdown and knowing reactionary tone, but the best SF car chase to date.\n",
        "A violence-intoxicated, far-fetched, morally corrupt drama.\n",
        "From a helicopter's point-of-view, The Rock is just typical big American dumb fun. It's only when you look underneath at the film's underlying assumptions that you want to recoil.\n",
        "A popcorn-movie deluxe.\n",
        "Slick and forceful, largely unconcerned with character, eager for any opportunity to pump up the volume both literally and metaphorically, The Rock is the kind of efficient entertainment that is hard to take pleasure in.\n",
        "Producers Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson have a highly-successful resume that includes Top Gun and Crimson Tide. The Rock will add more luster to that reputation.\n",
        "The movie deteriorates into a long commercial for the home-game version of itself.\n",
        "When film more or less took over melodrama from the theater ninety years ago, it proudly provided real oceans instead of canvas waves rippled by stagehands; but the plots remained humbug ... The Rock is as ridiculous an example as one could want.\n",
        "Pure why-not bravado, pumped-up and staggeringly dishonest but exciting just the same.\n",
        "Excitement may be The Rock's selling point, but it has plenty more to offer than you bargained for.\n",
        "Cage steals the show, adding a touch of wimpiness to the high-decibel bravado.\n",
        "[A] 2 1/4-hour exercise in overkill.\n",
        "A first-rate, slam-bang action thriller with a lot of style and no little humor.\n",
        "Even in a movie that's all noise and bluster, Cage and Connery inject tasty bits of personality into their roles.\n",
        "...a distasteful affair that should embarrass all concerned...\n",
        "You know a movie is in trouble when a cow provides its only moment of authentic human interest.\n",
        "Even more than with most of Michael Crichton's concoctions, this one conveys the overwhelming impression of a mechanical entertainment, a very high concept in which the characters and their problems seem like utterly arbitrary creations.\n",
        "Effects apart, this is dire: predictable, cliched, sloppily written, pitifully performed and surprisingly short of real shocks and suspense.\n",
        "It looks real, and Director Jan De Bont keeps the action coming so fast there's no time to question it.\n",
        "An expert in making audiences squirm and twist, at making us feel the rush of experience right along with the actors, De Bont choreographs action and suspense so beautifully he makes it seem like a snap.\n",
        "A summer crowd-pleaser worthy of its wind.\n",
        "The movie is wall-to-wall with special effects, and they're all convincing, although it's impossible for me to explain how Bill and Jo escape serious injury while staring right up into the Suck Zone of the Finger of God.\n",
        "It's a perfect motion picture roller coaster -- fun, fast, and furious... as long as you don't think too hard.\n",
        "Science aside, it's not hard to feel that these excitable characters are a wee bit berserk. But the movie works as escapism even if you do know enough to come in out of the rain.\n",
        "The jokes come in sporadic volleys rather than the steady machine-gun pace of The Naked Gun and Airplane!, and, with a few exceptions, they are less truly aimed.\n",
        "As funny as Nielsen can be, like all comic actors he still needs the quick-thinking jokes and zingy one-liners to be genuinely funny.\n",
        "Spy Hard just comes off as a long commercial. And yes, that means most of the best moments you've seen in the movie's trailer.\n",
        "More of a cinematic joke book than a real movie, Spy Hard hits you with gags faster than Henny Youngman on speed. Even when individual bits misfire, the unrelenting barrage of silliness can break down your resistance.\n",
        "Spy Hard is a loose send-up of the Bond series and other overly expensive action flicks, but after Hot Shots! Part Deux and National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1 who needs another action parody?\n",
        "Never mind that the smutty, high-tech 007 capers already wink at the conventions of the bikini-clad, gizmo-strewn genre. If the martini is shaken, not stirred, why beat it to death with a swizzle stick?\n",
        "The picture that will test the durability of Leslie Nielsen's lowbrow franchise, Spy Hard sticks closely to the Naked Gun formula. Not only is the formula itself wearing thin, but the gags themselves feel recycled.\n",
        "Like Hot Shots! there's the same mistaken belief that simply tagging other films will be intrinsically funny...\n",
        "Nielsen, with his expert deadpan and sense of comic timing, creates the illusion of humor -- for about 15 minutes.\n",
        "This movie unfortunately wastes a perfectly promising idea -- satirizing James Bond films along with any other pop-culture celluloid phenomenon that crosses the filmmakers' minds.\n",
        "A dreadfully unfunny comedy that takes Naked Gun-like sketches and rehashes them without a whit of style or energy.\n",
        "When Spy Hard abruptly ends after only 81 minutes, you sense that it has used up every last round of available ammunition. It was simply exhausted and couldn't move another inch.\n",
        "You won't laugh hard at Spy Hard. And that's not because the jokes aren't funny. Most of them aren't even jokes.\n",
        "For all its unpleasant nature, it must be said that this film is a dynamic crime-and-punishment drama, brilliantly and broadly realized.\n",
        "A poetic, terse, beautifully exact, and highly personal re-creation of the American underworld, with an unpunctuated Joycean screenplay by Polonsky that is perhaps unique in the American cinema.\n",
        "What it lacks in sophistication (everything), it partly makes up for in sheer gall.\n",
        "It's a strong, lean piece of writing that moves quickly. Nothing is wasted, and nothing happens the way you'd expect.\n",
        "A movie that shoehorns a blunt warning into its silly but entertaining story of a young radio astronomer's one-man battle against sinister extraterrestrials.\n",
        "The movie is as smart as ``Mission: Impossible'' is dumb.\n",
        "This is not a dumb movie; in fact, with its heavy reliance upon real science, it's startlingly credible.\n",
        "[Sheen] spends most of the movie in a kind of sweaty apoplexy that makes one worry for his health.\n",
        "In part a hilarious satire about Canadian timidity, it also comes across periodically as a formalist gem about nothing at all.\n",
        "Uniquely weird, subtly macabre, and utterly compelling.\n",
        "Careful is one long and amusing pun on German Expressionistic film imagery, Freudian psychology and quasi-Wagnerian storytelling, all carried to absurdist lengths.\n",
        "There's something wonderfully unique about the project but the reasons for doing it remain buried.\n",
        "Careful, the hilariously bizarre new film from Canadian director Guy Maddin, is like some lost masterpiece from a time-warped alternative dimension -- a strange artifact that time forgot.\n",
        "Vanessa Redgrave has never been more likable on screen than in her buoyantly athletic turn here.\n",
        "Dig if you must, but this is fool's gold.\n",
        "No masterpiece, but a portrait worthy of the extraordinary woman it salutes.\n",
        "Moore's body is in better shape than her acting.\n",
        "For music biz insiders, This Is Spinal Tap is a vastly amusing satire of heavy metal bands.\n",
        "For all its japes and jokes, the movie is really about exhaustion of the spirit: sitting in a bleak hotel suite at 4 a.m. with the bad taste of last night in the mouth and the feeling that tomorrow will not be a better day.\n",
        "The material is consistently clever and funny, though ultimately the attitudes are too narrow to nourish a feature-length film.\n",
        "Reiner's brilliantly inventive script and smart visuals avoid all the obvious pitfalls, making this one of the funniest ever films about the music business.\n",
        "It stays so wickedly close to the subject that it is very nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.\n",
        "The film is a composite of classic moments, all of which we sense could have happened to any of the classic heavy metal bands -- or at least to those whose members combined delusions of greatness with low I.Q.s.\n",
        "This Is Spinal Tap doesn't pull punches...\n",
        "The satire has a deft, wicked touch.\n",
        "Someone deserves a timeout for letting this mawkish misfire get to the screen.\n",
        "Though this terrifically cast movie may prove a tad too detached even for some members of its targeted audience, it covers remarkable ground in less than two hours.\n",
        "Helmer Charles Matthau combines a sensitive screenplay adaptation of Truman Capote's autobiographical novel with a wonderful ensemble cast to create a jewel of a film.\n",
        "Star power isn't a problem in this episodic rendering of Truman Capote's novel. A scattershot story without focus is, which is why the film soon evaporates from the memory.\n",
        "The Israeli documentary Stalags, by Ari Libsker, should be subtitled, How To Turn a Sexy Subject Into a Boring Film.\n",
        "Stalags carries this line of inquiry forward, cramming an overwhelming amount of information and ideas into its 63 minutes -- not nearly enough time to explore satisfactorily all that it raises.\n",
        "Unfortunately, Ari Libsker's hour-plus docu on this potentially mind-boggling topic meanders disconnectedly, as various experts, collectors and storytellers kick around anecdotes and theories that tend to cancel each other out.\n",
        "However artless its presentation, Stalags imparts material that's difficult to shake off and impossible to dismiss.\n",
        "Only Fellini (Toby Dammit) really manages to make much of his source.\n",
        "[Toby Dammit] is marvelous: a short movie but a major one. The Vadim is as overdecorated and shrill as a drag ball, but still quite fun, and the Malle, based on one of Poe's best stories, is simply tedious.\n",
        "Trainspotting's saving grace is that there's a heck of a lot of entertainment value in this particular form of shallowness.\n",
        "Trainspotting, buoyed by a great Brit Pop soundtrack and Brian Tufano's agile cinematography, captures the stoned-out, gut-churning experience of hardcore addiction with hallucinogenic acuity.\n",
        "Trainspotting is a searing pop-art portrait of a lost generation blowing out its brains. As they rail, chuckle, shout and dive into darkness, you're trapped yourself between a bellylaugh and a scream.\n",
        "The film is about joy -- in conniving and surviving, in connecting with audiences, in its own fizzy, jizzy style. And that's why, compared with it, most other films look zombified.\n",
        "A cocktail of scuzzy charm, nerve and despair that seduces and repulses in nearly equal proportions. It packs a jolt, all right. But it leaves you with a brutal hangover, too.\n",
        "It would be hard to imagine a movie about drugs, depravity, and all-around bad behavior more electrifying than Trainspotting.\n",
        "Scabrous, brutal and hip, Trainspotting is a Clockwork Orange for the '90s.\n",
        "This may not have the weight of 'Great Art', but it crystallises youthful disaffection with the verve of the best and brightest pop culture. A sensation.\n",
        "The experience of watching Trainspotting -- the electric, nasty and slick descent into the milieu of young Scottish junkies -- is a little like speeding through the digestive tract of some voracious beast.\n",
        "Trainspotting is a singular sensation, a visionary knockout spiked with insight, wild invention and outrageous wit.\n",
        "Exuberant and pitiless, profane yet eloquent, flush with the ability to create laughter out of unspeakable situations, \"Trainspotting\" is a drop-dead look at a dead-end lifestyle that has all the strength of its considerable contradictions.\n",
        "Far from nihilistic, though certainly calculated to butt up against various puritanical norms, [the film is a] feel-good jaunt about young Scottish heroin addicts and their degradation and betrayals of one another.\n",
        "This isn't an examination of the Scottish drug culture from the outside looking in, it's one from the inside looking out.\n",
        "Hip, brutally honest and humane...\n",
        "The movie has been attacked as pro-drug and defended as anti-drug, but actually it is simply pragmatic. It knows that addiction leads to an unmanageable, exhausting, intensely uncomfortable daily routine, and it knows that only two things make it bearable\n",
        "For better or worse, sometimes strictly for the sake of shock value, the stylish irreverence of \"Trainspotting\" mimics that drug high and delivers its own potent kick.\n",
        "This is not dour social realism. It's a shot- from-a-cannon youth movie, with likable young people sticking needles in their arms in working-class Edinburgh.\n",
        "...rapid-fire youth-culture freak show: random sex, in-your-face scatology, senseless violence and rampant profanity delivered in haggis-thick brogues.\n",
        "A few patches are subtitled, but the general effect is of watching an opera without having read the libretto.\n",
        "With its clotted script, art direction that's all splash and no style, and dialogue that's too nakedly calculated to facilitate identification), this tedious and confused movie points several characters in obvious directions.\n",
        "A tired piece of romantic cornball fare that harks back to a bygone era, the film is a badly conceived, poorly executed fairy tale guaranteed to make audiences squirm in their seats.\n",
        "Tripplehorn and McDermott are likable enough in their roles, but Holzman's precious, overwritten script gives them few genuinely honest moments.\n",
        "Here is the most tiresome and affected movie in many a moon, a 114-minute demonstration of the Idiot Plot, in which everything could be solved with a few well-chosen words that are never spoken.\n",
        "A fragmentary and amateurish fairy tale.\n",
        "Tripplehorn and McDermott don't look as if they belong together and aren't strong enough actors to overcome their physical incompatibility. So there's no sense of urgency about them getting together.\n",
        "The payoff, such as it is, is distressingly anticlimactic, and results in frustration.\n",
        "Winnie Holzman's screenplay is uneven.\n",
        "The studio left this alleged romantic comedy sitting on the shelf for a year -- and it didn't improve with age.\n",
        "Splendidly cheesy entertainment.\n",
        "It's the first futuristic disaster movie that's as cute as a button. Which, when all the special effects blow over, is what we Americans like in a monster hit.\n",
        "If I were a 10-year-old boy, I'd probably think it was the coolest movie going.\n",
        "As unavoidably entertaining as it is hopelessly cornball.\n",
        "Maybe the moviemakers' mission was to boldly go where everyone in Hollywood has gone before: the bank.\n",
        "The earnestness, the effects, and the notion of a whole world forgetting its differences to defeat a common foe carry a certain charm.\n",
        "Everything feels anti-climactic after the fireworks, but the moral is clear: it's the end of the world as we know it. And we feel fine.\n",
        "The picture is ultimately fun, thanks mostly to the colorful characters and the mock-hero ic spirit that kicks in full-throttle after the world has almost been destroyed.\n",
        "So much about ID4 is so old it's inevitable that homesick audiences, eager for familiar scenarios, will embrace it as if it's nothing but new.\n",
        "The film has a genial it's-only-a-movie attitude that sets it apart, quite emphatically, from other blockbuster action movies.\n",
        "As for the human characters, they give merely adequate back-seat support to the special effects that drive this big-budget thriller.\n",
        "Unfortunately, and perhaps not unexpectedly, it doesn't live up to the hype.\n",
        "There's precious little reward in plumbing the world-historical implications of the screenplay.\n",
        "The aliens, when we finally see them, are a serious disappointment; couldn't they think of anything more interesting than octopus men?\n",
        "Though the movie isn't too deep, it's certainly a rousing state-of-the-art cartoon capped by an aerial-combat climax that, to its credit, isn't anti-climactic.\n",
        "You know going in that Independence Day will have terrific effects and loads of action. But the filmmakers have also carefully crafted appealing characters and several good relationships, which they develop as the story unfolds.\n",
        "[A] hilariously inscrutable exercise in pseudo-profundity.\n",
        "A civilized, mellow, and generally graceful chamber piece.\n",
        "A welcome reminder of Bertolucci's directorial assurance.\n",
        "[Bertolucci] builds an homage to beauty around a sullen void.\n",
        "In contrasting the sexuality and rebellion of Lucy's generation with his own, Bertolucci clearly yearns to rekindle his creative spirit.\n",
        "Even a lesser Bertolucci is an event, and Stealing Beauty has its charms.\n",
        "The movie plays like the kind of line a rich older guy would lay on a teenage model, suppressing his own intelligence and irony in order to spread out before her the wonderful world he would like to give her as a gift.\n",
        "It may not be epic in scale; in artistic terms, though, it's huge.\n",
        "What do you call a character study with shallow, sketchily-drawn characters, but a gorgeous setting? A scenery study, perhaps. Or an atmosphere study.\n",
        "For all the film's missteps, there is cause to echo the uncritical compliment bestowed by the playwright (Jeremy Irons) upon the film's ingenue (Liv Tyler): 'I so enjoyed watching you.'\n",
        "An awful but watchable baseball movie until it degenerates into an all-out howler.\n",
        "With maybe 25 belly laughs, the brazenly crude Kingpin is often uproarious, but be forewarned that its creators apparently conceived it underneath a limbo bar. How looow can a funny guilty pleasure go?\n",
        "Welcome back, big guy.\n",
        "The advanced weaponry and nifty scopes notwithstanding, most of the gunplay is pretty standard-issue, with most of the victims being anonymous targets present just to be picked off.\n",
        "It's a movie constructed around three or four self-consciously 'cool' episodes, and passably entertaining as such, but there's also an awful lot of uncool contrivance, coincidence and contempt for the audience.\n",
        "This is one of those movies where good guys don't miss, and bad guys can't shoot to save their lives.\n",
        "The bang-for-the-buck ratio is high enough to appease even the thinnest wallet.\n",
        "Arnold Schwarzenegger tries his hardest to look formidable, forbidding and stern in Eraser, but what he mostly looks is tired.\n",
        "The middling result, diverting while it lasts but too silly to recommend, is merely this week's funhouse action pic.\n",
        "Even for escapism, this is on the crazy side.\n",
        "Good action fun, with spectacular stunts and special effects.\n",
        "The premise is moderately intriguing.\n",
        "[Murphy] is able to invest his Professor Klump with an endearing dignity, give his lounge lizard alter ego, Buddy Love, an alligator's bite and then go on from there to play Klump's grandma. Also his mother, father and brother.\n",
        "Murphy's most assured work in some time.\n",
        "This is good, seamless comedy.\n",
        "This is a chance to see Murphy doing what he does best, and for that alone it's worth seeing.\n",
        "The flick is sketch comedy spun out to feature length.\n",
        "Eddie Murphy is funny again. Sadly, he lacks the guts to follow through on the cathartic self-satire that gives the film its distinction.\n",
        "Messy, raucous, crude and undisciplined though this remake of the 1963 Jerry Lewis vehicle is, it also creates more laughter (and poignancy) than any Eddie Murphy movie has in quite some time.\n",
        "Murphy proves himself a surprisingly strong actor here, playing Sherman with sweetness and poignancy, not to mention loads of funny weight-related humor.\n",
        "This movie is a little too interested in easy jokes to bother with having a heart.\n",
        "The movie succeeds in two different ways: It's sweet and good-hearted, and then again it's raucous slapstick and bathroom humor.\n",
        "At long last again, an Eddie Murphy movie has its plug in the socket.\n",
        "Murphy outdoes himself by bringing pathos as well as sweetness to the character, arguably making him a viable update of Lewis's bucktoothed Julius Kelp.\n",
        "An uneven but hilarious remake.\n",
        "The Nutty Professor isn't much of a movie, but it's certainly a prime showcase for Eddie Murphy's enormous talent.\n",
        "Sami Frey gives an astonishingly intense perfromance in his portrait of the genius and madness of the famed French poet-intellectual.\n",
        "Though the explosion that seals off New York and New Jersey will have even curious theater concession stand crews bolting their posts, the characterizations are strictly low-cal.\n",
        "Story was originally conceived as an episode of \"Tales From the Crypt,\" and that is perhaps what it should have remained, as the thinness of the conceit shows throughout, painfully so in the first half.\n",
        "At times the relentless special effects and tangled plotting veer towards visual and narrative overkill, but the final tonal swerve is shocking and effective.\n",
        "The actors can't keep the film's mood from verging on hysteria as the story roams all over the map. \"The Frighteners\" has flitted everywhere, even to heaven and hell, before it's over.\n",
        "Fortunately director Jackson, at home with all kinds of excess, keeps everything spinning nicely, not even losing a step when the mood turns increasingly disturbing.\n",
        "Incredible, the amount of work that went into ``The Frighteners.'' And appalling.\n",
        "A mess with sporadic flashes of creativity.\n",
        "An object lesson in what to avoid when making the transition from low-budget films to studio productions.\n",
        "The Frighteners is ... that rare horror film that actually gets better as it proceeds; this scare machine has a heart and a brain.\n",
        "A very draggy affair because Harriet's exploits are treated like an episodic laundry list.\n",
        "There's dancing, and bubble blowing and bed bouncing that's entirely aimless and Harriet's neighborhood sleuthing becomes particularly pointless.\n",
        "The film's OK, a little thick with sensory overload, but it wasn't made for old guys like me.\n",
        "...a tedious adaptation...\n",
        "As the film progresses, the story becomes engaging.\n",
        "Harriet the Spy is an intelligent, insightful look at the tribulations of being a creative, misunderstood misfit at age eleven.\n",
        "There's a certain amateurish quality about Harriet the Spy, but it's more the TV-trained grownups behind the camera...than the pint-sized thespians in front of it.\n",
        "...the pacing is slow and there are scenes that seem amateurish...\n",
        "Fresh and charming, it never plays down to kids.\n",
        "Harriet the Spy has real character in some of its details, but it never feels like much more than a low-budget TV show.\n",
        "Works best if you can switch off your brain. Those who can will reach weepy nirvana. Those who can't will find this sticky-sweet wallow a bit, well, dumb.\n",
        "Comes perilously close to becoming a gab-fest treadmill.\n",
        "Burns manages to take on a laundry list of touchy issues in a relatively frank, unflinching manner. His characters retain their dignity and integrity without false dramatic redemption. It's a true adult saga.\n",
        "A bland, so-so romantic comedy without the charm to see it through.\n",
        "She's the One isn't slick, smooth or particularly good, and it offers only a perfunctory exploration of the human heart.\n",
        "Edward Burns returns to the themes of family and love that he examined in The Brothers McMullen.\n",
        "Sadly, the 28-year-old Irish auteur from New York lost his footing while stepping up the Hollywood food chain. Slickness set in.\n",
        "A funnier, more polished variation on actor/director Ed Burns' The Brothers McMullen.\n",
        "Burns emphatically avoids sophomore slump with an inviting, ruefully funny film that lives up to his initial promise.\n",
        "Although the movie disappointed me, it did not dishearten me about Edwards Burns as an actor or filmmaker.\n",
        "The sophomore jinx, the bane of hot, young film makers, has struck again.\n",
        "A quality, offbeat movie.\n",
        "Light but hilarious...\n",
        "A likable -- maybe even lovable -- movie.\n",
        "Although it has its share of implausibilities, A Time To Kill is generally the most satisfying of the John Grisham screen adaptations to date.\n",
        "Justice may be blind, but rarely have courtroom dramas presumed quite so heavily on cultural myopia as this heinous version of John Grisham's first novel.\n",
        "If the film doesn't add up to a cogent legal argument, neither does it have trouble delivering 2 hours and 20 minutes' worth of sturdy, highly charged drama.\n",
        "Untrained as an actor, with only three minor roles to his credit, McConaughey holds the screen against Samuel L. Jackson, Sandra Bullock and Kevin Spacey, and completely justifies the buzz surrounding his role...\n",
        "McConaughey, 26, is dynamite in a performance of smarts, sexiness, scrappy humor and unmistakable star sizzle.\n",
        "A skillfully constructed morality play that pushes all the right buttons and arrives at all the right conclusions.\n",
        "Like many artists today, Grisham and Schumacher exploit racial tension without understanding it.\n",
        "Despite certain drawbacks, A Time to Kill is involving, energetic, and occasionally thought-provoking. All things considered, this film will make for a worthwhile trip to the cinema for all, not just those who have time to kill.\n",
        "A handsome but riotously cluttered melodrama with maybe 145 subplots.\n",
        "A three-character, one-set chamber piece, pic lacks the bravura moments of the film version of the playwright's Glengarry Glen Ross\n",
        "There are bits of the three-episode Rendezvous in Paris that are, if not like watching paint dry, like watching the painter spackle the picture-hook holes and edge around the windows.\n",
        "As with many of his other films, Rohmer proves that social intercourse can be as delightful as the sexual variety.\n",
        "Somehow Rohmer keeps it fresh, if only because, after more than 30 years of making the same movie, there can be no doubt he's sincere.\n",
        "Rohmer proves that sometimes shriveled fruit yields the strongest juice, provided you squeeze hard enough.\n",
        "One of the best of his works.\n",
        "Precise, simple and deeply serious beneath their breezy and seductive surface, these stories enchantingly explore love's little treacheries and the stubborn immutability of human nature.\n",
        "Doesn't quite achieve its goal, but this overgrown little movie does offer solid laughs, engaging performances and a captivating setting.\n",
        "Mystery, Alaska is a raucous come-from-nowhere sports movie that scores big.\n",
        "A hybrid of sports movies and TV sitcoms with little originality and few surprises or memorably rough edges.\n",
        "The Detroit Red Wings' season begins Saturday. Why enrich Disney's coffers for a shameless piece of cinematic junk like Mystery, Alaska when you can see the real thing?\n",
        "Mystery, Alaska is sweet, pleasant, low-key, inoffensive and unnecessary.\n",
        "Raucously funny.\n",
        "Mystery, Alaska is fun to watch, even if you're not a hockey fan, thanks to an appealing cast and some exciting game scenes.\n",
        "More hockey and less quirky drama might have saved this yawner.\n",
        "Roach has to deal with some pure corn at the end, but he pulls it off and guides the actors to and through far better moments.\n",
        "Conveys some of the thrill and ferocity of ice hockey while skillfully folding together multiple personal dramas.\n",
        "There is no denying Kelley's ability to write a funny one-liner or pen a poignant speech, but this frustrating film has the potential to be much more than it is, especially with the collection of able actors on hand.\n",
        "Overpopulated with characters.\n",
        "Kelley is obviously aware that to make the move from TV to films he must fill his scripts with greater depth and density.\n",
        "It contains nothing more than weather and a set of one-dimensional cut-outs.\n",
        "In his Hollywood debut, Shaq more or less played himself as a coveted college center in William Friedkin's excellent Blue Chips. Kazaam is a compelling argument for keeping him on the court and as far away from a movie set as possible.\n",
        "Are you bored yet?\n",
        "I'd call the film innocuous, except that Max's gangster dad is apparently an Italian-American and the movie's main villain is an Arab. Do kids really need these stereotypes reinforced? There's also more violence here than you might expect.\n",
        "Kazaam never brings off the trick we most want to see: It fails to make the jolly, 7-foot-1 Shaq larger than life.\n",
        "Too gritty, violent and downbeat for tykes, it's also a bit juvenile and fairy tale-like for teens and older auds.\n",
        "As fairy tale, buddy comedy, family drama, thriller or rap revue, Kazaam is simply uninspired and unconvincing, and Mr. O'Neal, who can carry a basketball team, lacks the charisma to rescue this misguided effort.\n",
        "The movie's producers could use a genie of their own. Surely, if granted three wishes, they could have produced a better film.\n",
        "The gloomy psychology detracts from the film's magic elements.\n",
        "As for Shaquille O'Neal, given his own three wishes the next time, he should go for a script, a director and an interesting character.\n",
        "One thing is for certain: When a genie movie doesn't come up with satisfying wishes, it's a sure sign it's not really interested in genies but in putting a seven-foot basketball player in a funny outfit.\n",
        "This is as witless as movies come -- an unamusing, moronic blend of horrible acting and inept screenwriting.\n",
        "The story blares its lessons like a shameless after-school TV special.\n",
        "Manages to eke out only infrequent, peanut-size pleasures along its lumbering way.\n",
        "A considerably better second installment than one usually encounters.\n",
        "As a satire of a sitcom that wasn't funny, it's often at its funniest when it's purposely stale.\n",
        "I didn't laugh much during A Very Brady Sequel, but I did smile a lot.\n",
        "Still delivers diverting comic fluff for the bland clan's fans.\n",
        "No incarnation of the Brady Bunch, no matter how cleverly satirized, can use up an hour and a half's screen time without making the audience feel like they've overdosed.\n",
        "A Very Brady Sequel isn't great, but it's enjoyable.\n",
        "The new film hints mischievously at the kind of dysfunction that would truly bring the Brady bunch up to date.\n",
        "Wryly and delightfully witty.\n",
        "It's as if the film were a kind of living notebook for what Rohmer was to do later, with greater ease and refinement.\n",
        "Rohmer's impossibly light, graceful way of posing profound moral questions hasn't yet wholly coalesced, though this 1966 film does have his soft, slow rhythm.\n",
        "The conflict between logic and the unknowable is as fascinating and exciting for us as it clearly is for Herzog.\n",
        "A lyrical film about the least lyrical of men.\n",
        "Every Man is a superb movie because Mr. Herzog has managed to treat the fable in stunning human and dramatic terms.\n",
        "It's the woodsy children's movie Walt Disney didn't want to make: chockablock with mischievous mayhem and light on the sap.\n",
        "Unfortunately, nothing that any of the humans contribute to Joe's Apartment is nearly as interesting as the musical numbers and comedy riffs of the cockroaches.\n",
        "Some viewers will still want to reach for the Raid.\n",
        "John Payson's Joe's Apartment may well have been a funny MTV short, but stretched to feature length it's got to be the most putrid picture since The Garbage Pail Kids Movie nearly a decade ago.\n",
        "There's not enough story here for something half that length, so we're subjected to numerous pointless and irritating song-and-dance numbers designed to nudge the lame plot towards its conclusion.\n",
        "The insects have obnoxious, piping little voices and sound like the Chipmunks had inhaled helium.\n",
        "So much up-to- the-minute technology hasn't been used for so disastrous a product since the Hindenburg.\n",
        "The special nature of this story is its many climaxes that border on false endings and also how Gibson's character responds to the ransom demand of $2 million.... it is Gibson who sells us on it and sells it well.\n",
        "There are more climaxes in here than in a Swedish blue movie. This is not to say you won't be thrilled, charged up and put through the ringer at times, but your intelligence will need to be shoved under your seat like warm, flat soda.\n",
        "That's interesting stuff, but it doesn't play out with a lot of smarts. And the opportunity to end Ransom on a creepy note of unpredictability is forsaken for the usual glass-shattering, bullets-flying finale.\n",
        "With a mechanical movie like this, filmmakers -- male or female -- can't take chances. Howard and company are hostages to their own conception.\n",
        "Mel Gibson and Rene Russo put an edgy 1990s spin on the roles originally played by Glenn Ford and Donna Reed.\n",
        "By the time Tom Mullen has turned into an action superhero in a clumsy climax, Ransom has run out of ideas, and we've lost track of what we felt about a father's frantic efforts to save his son.\n",
        "Its major sin -- a certain ineluctable improbability -- is pretty much offset by the moments of winsome humanity Gibson finds for his freebooter; by the rich, nicely tuned portrayals of the other actors; and by director Ron Howard.\n",
        "A gripping, amoral kidnap thriller.\n",
        "If Howard's direction were as stylized and self-aware as Corgan's music, Ransom might be something more than a shallow and unprovocative story of a vigilante with an Achilles' heel.\n",
        "Slick and violent and reasonably tense, Ransom holds your attention without being the least bit interesting.\n",
        "Gibson has always had a mesmerizing dark side (remember his vengefulness in Mad Max?), and when his rage catches fire, so does Ransom.\n",
        "A crackerjack thriller with some unusually tasty plot twists, Ransom pays plenty of entertaining dividends.\n",
        "Howard pushes and probes this rich tension with expert casting, restless camerawork and a fractured editing style.\n",
        "Mr. Howard has made ''Ransom'' in the same clean, swift, logical style that sent his ''Apollo 13'' into orbit, resulting in a spellbinding crime tale that delivers surprises right down to the wire.\n",
        "A noxious, nerve-splitting invitation to vigilante rage.\n",
        "Here's a tension-packed thriller that will shake your head and rattle your brain.\n",
        "A persuasive thriller for most of its length, it stumbles in its attempt to become an upscale version of Death Wish and other vigilante dramas and ends up derailing with a soft thud.\n",
        "Gibson gives an interesting performance, showing a man trying to think his way out of a crisis, and Sinise makes a good foil: Here are two smart men playing a game with deadly stakes.\n",
        "Strong acting, smart dialogue, and a couple of neat twists counterbalance many of Ransom's weaknesses.\n",
        "Joyce Carol Oates and her fans will be disappointed by this trivial and muddled screen version of her popular novel about female bonding and empowerment.\n",
        "Chain Reaction isn't dull -- the film is paced to keep audiences attentive -- but the lack of originality dampens its enjoyability.\n",
        "[Chain Reaction] has better acting, better writing, more spectacular chase sequences and more genuine drama than all of this summer's blockbusters.\n",
        "It's not a bad film in individual moments and in the energy of itsperformances, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.\n",
        "The movie is so uninvolving that it inspires renewed respect for Broken Arrow, which was equally stupid but excitingly filmed.\n",
        "The narrative is very complex, but what's on the screen is little more than generic, non-narrative-specific, guy-being-chased stuff.\n",
        "Plodding and predictable, and a big disappointment.\n",
        "With her sweet-sad face, Mara Wilson is a perfect Matilda.\n",
        "[A] predictable and sugarcoated (even criminally negligent) take on The Parent Trap.\n",
        "To the slim degree that it qualifies as a comedy, House Arrest is a comedy with rank amateur pathos, and it's totally out of touch with its own superficially treated emotions.\n",
        "A headache of a movie with a Parent Trap premise that quickly devolves into clamorous farce.\n",
        "One of the year's worst movies... at least I hope so, or it's going to be a very bad year.\n",
        "A tepid and repetitious comedy.\n",
        "There's little to commend this formulaic and misleading fantasy, which seems sadly aimed at an especially fragile audience -- kids from broken homes who all too often blame themselves.\n",
        "The characters are so broadly overdrawn and the performances so over the top, it's a tossup as to which hell you'd least like to visit. Upstairs? Downstairs?\n",
        "A distressingly unfunny, unintelligent children's fantasy about what happens when kids ground their parents.\n",
        "House Arrest is an uneasy mix of too much and too little: too much vapid cuteness, too little real feeling.\n",
        "As sitcoms go, House Arrest, opening today, is more sit than com.\n",
        "One of those rare horror films that induces discomfort by showing practically nothing.\n",
        "It has some queasy scenes, but unclear progression and plodding direction give this an old-fashioned air.\n",
        "As absurd and as beautiful as a fairy tale.\n",
        "A marvellous movie in the fullest sense.\n",
        "Among the most disturbing horror films ever made.\n",
        "Outre as it is, never tires as hypnotic, touching, ghastly fun.\n",
        "It infects your dreams with dread and desperation.\n",
        "Franju constructs an elegant visual work; here is a horror movie in which the shrieks are not by the characters but by the images.\n",
        "Like a nightmare that never ends, this is a vision of madness, loneliness and, yes, horror that, once seen, demands to be viewed over and over again. It is that haunting, and that good.\n",
        "A masterpiece of poetic horror and tactful, tactile brutality.\n",
        "Sends a chill that extends from the cheekbones through the eye sockets to the back of the skull.\n",
        "Adolescent boys might groove to the mix, but most other ticketbuyers will avoid this tawdry opus like the plague.\n",
        "Triple the length of its cable television inspiration, Tales From the Crypt Presents Bordello of Blood is triple the gore, triple the naked women, but not, alas, triple the fun.\n",
        "What it lacks in irony and suspense, Gilbert Adler's Tales From the Crypt Presents Bordello of Blood makes up for in whimsy and cheeky self-assurance.\n",
        "This gory vampire spoof is remarkably free of jolts, hardly registering as a fright film, with a series of weak special effects involving many globs of guts.\n",
        "This sickeningly puerile mess will be attractive only to teen boys who aren't too picky about special effects or scripts.\n",
        "Vampires aren't the only things in Bordello of Blood that can't stand up to daylight. Neither can the plot.\n",
        "... a macabre, jokey affair that could give Buffy the Vampire Slayer a run for its money as the silliest undead story of the decade.\n",
        "It is more amusing to talk about than to experience.\n",
        "Original in some ways but the same old plate of fried green tomatoes in others, this Sundance Festival favorite might rate wider acclaim for its two leads if the overall tone weren't so bloodless and even dreary.\n",

        "The special effects vary from OK to lame to very lame.\n",
        "Dark, percussive and perversely fun.\n",
        "Escape from L.A. is too preposterous to be a good film. But in keeping with its title, it does provide a couple of hours of entertaining escapism.\n",
        "Buscemi, Fonda, Robertson, Grier and many others get to make vivid impressions, but of course it's Russell who must carry this swiftly paced picture. As rugged as ever and attractively weathered, he does so with ease.\n",
        "A significant improvement over the first Snake Plisskin adventure.\n",
        "As amusing as some of its notions may be, none are developed into sustained running jokes.\n",
        "John Carpenter's vision of a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles is a go-for-broke action extravaganza that satirizes the genre at the same time it's exploiting it.\n",
        "Intermittently clever ideas are rarely executed to full effect, but the film moves reasonably well on its way to surround-sound pyrotechnics amid a climactic aerial attack.\n",
        "A poetic pulp movie made with joy.\n",
        "Tries but fails to be an action-hero flick or even a parody of one.\n",
        "This is the kind of movie Independence Day could have been if it hadn't played it safe.\n",
        "As he always does in comedy, Costner grants an irresistible gleam of gallantry to male mulishness.\n",
        "Tin Cup works for viewers of any handicap.\n",
        "The climactic game, in which Roy, in a way that defies prediction, attempts to sink the shot of his life, is the most rousing sequence of the year, a celebration of what it really means to win.\n",
        "Amiable and constantly amusing rather than uproarious, this mangy tale of a ne'er-do-well's fitful assault on personal and professional respectability benefits greatly from Kevin Costner's ingratiatingly comic star turn.\n",
        "Costner hasn't been this charming and spontaneous for years.\n",
        "Tin Cup, starring Kevin Costner as a likable loser, accomplishes the impossible, maybe the unimaginable -- it makes golf entertaining.\n",
        "Dispiritingly conventional and obvious.\n",
        "This film's overriding message is as pleasing as its flippant, skillful banter.\n",
        "Breaking down the golf trajectories into separate shots during the sports climax comes across as an expedient form of cheating--the very opposite of authenticity.\n",
        "As sports movies go (regardless of the sport), this one turns in a respectable showing, injecting some intelligence and maturity into a story that easily could have succumbed to a flood of 'struggling underdog' cliches.\n",
        "[A] quirkily easygoing comedy.\n",
        "A formula sports comedy with a lot of non-formula human comedy.\n",
        "Streep's beauty and talent and director Fred Schepisi's intelligence are both shown to best advantage, without easy points or grandstanding.\n",
        "Streep and Neill are the film's perfectly matched thoroughbreds. But the film is neither a double star turn nor the best kind of courtroom drama; it is a sort of epic mosaic of national character.\n",
        "Streep (the best thing she has done in ages) carries it along.\n",
        "Streep ... plays Lindy Chamberlain with the kind of virtuosity that seems to redefine the possibilities of screen acting.\n",
        "Streep's performance is risky, and masterful.\n",
        "Streep -- yes, with another perfect accent -- brings her customary skillfulness to the part. It's not a showy performance, but the heroine's internal struggle seems to come from the actress' pores.\n",
        "The Godfather is overflowing with life, rich with all the grand emotions and vital juices of existence, up to and including blood.\n",
        "To permit us a glimpse at The Mob, with all of its ethnic insularity, is like giving a chronic gambler a chance to wander above the false mirrors that overlook every casino.\n",
        "Brando's triumph and fascination is less that of an actor of parts than of a star galaxy of myths.\n",
        "Traces the arc of this doomed idealism with a beauty that is still fresh.\n",
        "Brando made Don Vito something we rarely see in movies: a tragicomic villain-hero, a vulnerable hood.\n",
        "In its blending of new depth with an old genre, it becomes that rarity, a mass entertainment that is also great movie art.\n",
        "As filmmaking and storytelling, 'The Godfather' remains a bravura piece of work, its set pieces, dialogue and performances entrenched cinematic icons.\n",
        "There are volumes that could be written -- and have been -- about the movie's uniformly powerful performances; its precedent-setting editing by William Reynolds and Peter Zinner; Nino Rota's haunting score; and Dean Tavoularis's evocative set design.\n",
        "The biggest achievement here is the establishment of mood and time.\n",
        "The ultimate family film.\n",
        "An everyday story of Mafia folk, incorporating a severed horse's head in the bed and a number of heartwarming family occasions, as well as pointers on how not to behave in your local trattoria.\n",
        "Francis Ford Coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment.\n",
        "We come to The Godfather like Kay Adams -- outsiders uncertain in our expectations - but it doesn't take long for us to be captivated by this intricate, violent world.\n",
        "The years have been kind to this timeless Mafia epic, which seems particularly rich now that studio blockbusters no longer demonstrate this kind of care with character, atmosphere and storytelling.\n",
        "The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms.\n",
        "Corleone, the soft-spoken crimelord, is masterfully played by Brando in one of the most imitated performances of all time.\n",
        "In scene after scene ... Coppola crafted an enduring, undisputed masterpiece.\n",
        "If you're tired of burned-out coppers in Hollywood's blockbusters, try this offbeat hero from Hong Kong.\n",
        "To watch Jackie Chan, Hong Kong's king of kung fu comedy, in the fresh and exhilarating Super Cop is like watching Douglas Fairbanks Sr. or one of the silent era clowns in one of their biggest hits.\n",
        "Sly and Schwartzy, eat your hearts out. Chan's the man.\n",
        "The most powerful starring role for a woman this summer? My vote goes to Michelle Khan in this garish, frenetic, and funny chopper from Rumble in the Bronx director Stanley Tong.\n",
        "All this is executed with a good deal of panache, if not originality, by stunt coordinator Stanley Tong.\n",
        "With martial arts superstar Jackie Chan, older may be better.\n",
        "Supercop is a chance to get a full-strength blast of Chan.\n",
        "Jackie Chan makes his second leap at the American movie audience, following up Rumble in the Bronx with a far sharper mix of stunts, martial arts and Chan's own brand of breathtaking slapstick comedy.\n",
        "Supercop is a better movie than Rumble in the Bronx, in large part because it's funnier.\n",
        "Chan is fun to watch, no matter what silliness one has to put up with.\n",
        "Supercop's biggest flaw is what its producers probably saw as its greatest strength: it's very American.\n",
        "It's kind of silly, but how many movies boast a leading man who isn't afraid to order 'roast cat and string beans' at a Chinese restaurant?\n",
        "An astonishingly fluid and funny movie that makes most American action pictures seem lethargic.\n",
        "A wild and free-wheeling action film, vastly superior to this year's Rumble in the Bronx in both plot and action.\n",
        "Chan is joined in this outing by a female co-star, Michelle Khan, who seems every bit his equal when it comes to martial-arts prowess and foolhardy daredeviltry. Taken together, they're like watching two 007's, one 0014 or, as they say now, whatever.\n",
        "Its thematic scope stays rather small, and the final third of the movie seems muted and flat.\n",
        "A sweet little fable, a bit shy on substance but quite charming in the telling.\n",
        "An unapologetically small but wholly original movie, warm-hearted but not precious, and possessed of a gently wacky sensibility.\n",
        "Though employing no surreal devices and remaining within a realistic convention, Krueger takes the story of two young sisters on their own and somehow makes it seem unreal, strange, outside time.\n",
        "It's the kind of story that leaves viewers with a warm glow.\n",
        "With its carefully-modulated combination of light comedy and drama, the film casts a gentle spell.\n",
        "It is a slight enterprise, not always expert in its construction, but it is sweet without being cloying, and it is sentimental in beneficial ways.\n",
        "One of the pleasures of Manny & Lo is the way that it reveals its characters in sudden, unexpected, defining acts.\n",
        "The story settles into a fairly routine feminist fable.\n",
        "That the actors can pull off such Oprah-friendly, sci-fi-inflected sap and keep straight faces is the most fantastic thing about this loopy love story.\n",
        "The movie moves fast, as though to distract you from these shortcomings and the nearly total absence of logic.\n",
        "Buy the book.\n",
        "I'm over the moon about this movie, which smooths out the psychological dissonances in Audrey Niffenegger's fine novel but is still an emotional workout.\n",
        "Some fans of the book might enjoy seeing these two soul mates brought to life on the big screen, but for everyone else the interpretation seems forced and at times inconsistent.\n",
        "I thought really very little in the film worked.\n",
        "Long spans of time pass between lines of dialogue, many of which seem to have been inexpertly translated from a foreign language so that they almost make sense but not quite.\n",
        "The emotions and crises feel pre-sanded, smooth to the point of blandness. The transitional disappearances are routine.\n",
        "It's hard to live in stolen moments, but trying to find a few enjoyable ones in The Time Traveler's Wife is nearly impossible.\n",
        "Yet where there should be heat, a cold wind blows.\n",
        "A Twilight Zone premise written like a Mariah Carey song, The Time Traveler's Wife is destined for a warm welcome on an obscure cable network. The Spinster Movie Station? The Lonely Hearts Channel?\n",
        "The whole thing feels arbitrary. Henry and Clare's love is bedeviled not by anything they've done or have any control over, so the drama fails to build.\n",
        "A kooky, head-spinning romantic mess.\n",
        "I'd watch the vibrant Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana in anything, but The Time Traveler's Wife is pushing it.\n",
        "Romance is robbed of its gamble, stripped of its suspense, shorn of its mystery, and deprived of an ending that feels earned.\n",
        "There's not much [McAdams] or Bana can do to rescue this dreary piece of romantic hooey.\n",
        "It takes, as its subjects, the sadness and grandeur of life and the mystery of time, and it offers a full experience to those who find its wavelength.\n",
        "Suspend your disbelief and you might find The Time Traveler's Wife a charming if mildly depressing fantasy. Or you might, as I did, travel elsewhere during it. Either way, at least it's a picturesque journey.\n",
        "The fact that Bana is a bit of a cold fish and real sparks never really ignite between he and McAdams, who is 10 years his junior, doesn't help matters.\n",
        "I'll let you in on a little secret that film critics have known for years. A major studio production, released in August with top-list stars, is almost certain to be a gobbler.\n",
        "Some caper movies build suspense, while others tweak the genre with tongue lancing cheek. But this lesbian caper pic often pulls off both feats in the same scene, even simultaneously.\n",
        "Altman loves to explode movie genres, and his script, co-written with Frank Barhydt, fuses the classic '30s screwball comedy and crime film.\n",
        "It could never for an instant be mistaken for anything but a Robert Altman film, and that counts for a lot.\n",
        "Jennifer Jason Leigh and Miranda Richardson are synergetic perfection as social opposites thrown together for 24 hours in a 1934 hot town.\n",
        "A sadly ordinary motion picture, and, in less sure hands, it might have been something of an unfortunate mess. Even with Altman at the helm, however, it manages to be singularly unremarkable.\n",
        "Would someone throw a net over Jennifer Jason Leigh? She's at it again.\n",
        "All of the characters act as if somebody might come along someday and make a movie about them. And Altman, who made the movie, gets his chance to sit in at last on one of those cutting sessions.\n",
        "Let's just say that if you find it arbitrary and more an expression of Altman's feelings about class than the outcome of his story, then we are in agreement.\n",
        "[It] has its own brawling vitality.\n",
        "This is one of the summer's sorrier excuses for a major-studio release.\n",
        "I don't even know where to start.\n",
        "It is testimony to the superior acting skills of Joe Pesci and Danny Glover that Gone Fishin' registers more than a blip on the summer movie radar screen.\n",
        "Big mistake.\n",
        "Film is so formulaic that virtually every plot point is telegraphed way in advance.\n",
        "This is a film that misses the boat right from the start through an improper mixture of fools.\n",
        "A mirthless, graceless slapstick comedy with little to recommend it except some Florida scenery -- which, come to think of it, isn't all that scenic.\n",
        "The saddest thing about this unfunny, misguided motion picture is watching two performers I admire -- Joe Pesci and Danny Glover -- stumble their way through such obviously inferior material.\n",
        "Cut bait and avoid this trip.\n",
        "The movie keeps switching focus without ever getting its bearings, and when Brando exits earlier than expected, there's little but mayhem to fall back on.\n",
        "Utterly conventional.\n",
        "The fight scenes are routine, the humor juvenile, and the Toronto locales rendered drab through muddy cinematography.\n",
        "Chow was never a martial arts star back home, but he's a good enough actor -- and an engaging enough personality -- to pass for one here.\n",
        "They made a ton of junky movies in Hong Kong, but those were dazzlingly fluid and high-flying junky movies. This American retread has the same sort of hack plot but none of the bravura.\n",
        "[T]he thing about the martial arts sequences -- you've got the great Chow Yun-Fat, but this thing is directed MTV style: cut here, cut there, close-up. So we can't really tell if he's doing stunts or if it's all tricks of camerawork.\n",
        "One of those motley movies that borrows from just about everywhere.\n",

        "Bulletproof Monk shoots blanks.\n",
        "Model-turned-actress Jaime King changed her first name (from James) to star in Bulletproof Monk. Given her performance, she might have to enter the witness-protection program.\n",
        "It's a testament to Chow's star power that, even with an accent more than casually reminiscent of Elmer Fudd's, he comes off charming, handsome and cool in a movie as ridiculous as Bulletproof Monk.\n",
        "The movie mixes dull dialogue, martial arts wire work and half-baked approximations of Eastern philosophy, some shallow enough to make the average fortune cookie seem profound.\n",
        "[A] lightweight but delightful martial-arts romp.\n",
        "A movie chockablock with too many elements.\n",
        "This is not a movie that sparks questions about the meaning of life. Well, maybe one: Dude, where's my Zen?\n",
        "Bulletproof Monk is such an overcooked and odoriferous turkey, the Butterball people ought to sue for defamation of character.\n",
        "Cheesy fun.\n",
        "Bulletproof Monk has more going for it than a promising title. It has a life and style that other buddy action movies lack.\n",
        "This isn't really a movie, it's just one chase scene stacked on top of another and stitched together with the thinnest thread of plot.\n",
        "If you like your chop-sockey with a healthy serving of cheese, corn and a few giggles, you won't be disappointed.\n",
        "A moronic knockoff of Jackie Chan's buddy/action comedies, directed without much imagination or aspiration by music-video veteran Paul Hunter.\n",
        "Outside of the moments of kinetic madness that represent the action sequences, this movie is an amalgamation of lame comedy, campy Eastern mysticism, and dumb plotting.\n",
        "This somber action picture bravely defies expectations and gives us something wholly new.\n",
        "Mann is the master of nighttime digital photography, and he fills the screen with stunning images and some intricately choreographed shoot-out scenes that I just loved.\n",
        "Miami Vice isn't perfect, but it is perfectly mesmerizing.\n",
        "I enjoyed Mr. Mann's new Miami Vice from its first ravishing frame to the last, but I can't say that very much of it made sense -- but then, neither do the daily headlines.\n",
        "It's business as usual for Mann. Truly terrific.\n",
        "The movie isn't perfect, but it's good enough, and better than most. It should keep us occupied until the big screen version of The Apprentice comes along.\n",
        "The truest thing to say about Miami Vice is that it's an OK picture with some superb things in it.\n",
        "If you're looking for a crime story that sizzles with action, sex and the visceral jolt of life on the edge, Miami Vice is the one.\n",
        "Miami Vice, the movie, is an atmospheric muddle, as gorgeous and unintelligible as raven-haired stunner Gong Li.\n",
        "It works as well as it ever did. It works because Mann makes it work.\n",
        "It offers a good amount of crowd-pleasing action, but the story is convoluted and the heroes are scowling mannequins.\n",
        "The antidote to M:i:III, Pirates II and every other circus of coagulated stunts is Miami Vice, my favorite Hollywood movie of the summer so far.\n",
        "Miami Vice is the last of the predicted summer blockbusters, and it delivers a reasonable amount of popcorn excitement.\n",
        "This is more of a thinking man's action flick -- a small, intense film made on a giant canvas that finds Mann experimenting with and pushing at the boundaries of mainstream filmmaking.\n",
        "It might be an empty vessel, but it zooms.\n",
        "Sensual and scary, the movie is so visually textured you feel as though you're brushing against the screen.\n",
        "Perhaps had they been given a script, a purpose or a mission, Miami Vice the movie might have been something worthy of the talented Mann's attention.\n",
        "Miami Vice exudes the kind of gritty life we expect, so much so that you might argue that neither Crockett nor Tubbs deserves to be called a main character; Mann reserves that role for crime itself.\n",
        "The film, like its oddly rumbling sky, promises more than it ever delivers. Granted, it can look cool. But more often, as we wait for the lightning that never arrives, it frustrates.\n",
        "Slicker than crude oil and just as unattractive.\n",
        "Run-of-the-mill horror item is notable only for final appearance of the late Donald Pleasance\n",
        "Although the series has obviously run out of steam, the ending leaves the door open for Michael's return. Really, it's about time the masks were removed once and for and all.\n",
        "'Enough of this Michael Meyers B.S.!,' says a disgruntled Haddonfielder, as news spreads of the returning native son. Dream on.\n",
        "Needless to say, the gore level is high and the scare level low -- although not as low as the intelligence level.\n",
        "This sixth installment, by far the worst in the series, is bland and deadening.\n",
        "Unfortunately, while director Joe Chapelle and writer Daniel Farrands took advantage of a clearance sale at the Horror Cliche Emporium, they forgot to stop in at Plots R Us.\n",
        "A handsome, agreeably performed rendition that fails to ignite much laughter or any real emotion.\n",
        "The direction is assured, and the cast is masterly.\n",
        "A comic meditation on desire, disguise and inherent bisexuality.\n",
        "An entertaining movie. No more, no less.\n",
        "Only fitfully do the actors actually seem to become the characters they are playing.\n",
        "British director Nunn doesn't always take advantage of the play's comic possibilities. But he creates absorbing, original moments -- in the unlikeliest of places.\n",
        "An innovative and imaginatively rendered version of Shakespeare's funniest play.\n",
        "Bonham Carter, who has grown wonderfully as an actress, walks the thin line between love and comedy...\n",
        "Stage director Trevor Nunn hasn't exploited it in his film of the chaotic Bard farce, which delivers only fitfully on goodwill the play automatically beckons.\n",
        "Shakespeare aficionados will probably be pleased that so much of the written word has made it to the screen, but the two-plus hour running length is a bit burdensome.\n",
        "A serious drama that is also funny without crossing into burlesque.\n",
        "French helmer Andre Techine's most personal--and arguably best--film is one of the few foreign language pictures that was recognized by most critics groups in the U.S.\n",
        "Some of the political undertones may go astray, but the emotional center of the film is touching and honest.\n",
        "The film is a Hepburn triumph, and moviegoers who resent the theatre's habit of requisitioning their stars may feel that Miss Hepburn's time on the stage has not been spent in vain and that she simply prepared herself for this achievement.\n",
        "In short, The Philadelphia Story lifts the daily drudge into a charming never-never land, with complete footnotes excusing its existence. And besides, it's a good, entertaining show.\n",
        "Every time Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart connect in a scene, we hear the happy ding! of quality champagne crystal.\n",
        "The smarties are going to relish Philadelphia Story a lot more than the two-bit trade...\n",
        "George Cukor gives it the royal treatment with a splendid supporting cast...\n",
        "Cukor and Donald Ogden Stewart's evergreen version of Philip Barry's romantic farce, centreing on a socialite wedding threatened by scandal, is a delight from start to finish, with everyone involved working on peak form.\n",
        "It has been a long time since Hollywood has spent itself so extravagantly, and to such entertaining effect, upon a straight upper-crust fable, an unblushing apologia for plutocracy.\n",
        "...this one's the Taj Mahal, Armstrong's footprint on the moon, the 2001 Arizona-New York World Series, the Clash's London Calling, and the perfect foamy head on an expertly poured Guinness.\n",
        "One of the shining glories of the American musical.\n",
        "A fancy package of musical entertainment with wide appeal and bright grossing prospects.\n",
        "If you've never seen it and don't, you're bonkers.\n",
        "Compounded generously of music, dance, color, spectacle and a riotous abundance of Gene Kelly, Jean Hagen and Donald O'Connor on the screen, all elements in this rainbow program are carefuly contrived and guaranteed to...put you in a buttercup mood.\n",
        "Watching Singin' in the Rain is an exuberant, magical experience -- a journey deep into the heart of feel-good territory.\n",
        "A rare musical whose story -- scripted by Betty Comden and Adolph Green -- is just as good as the songs.\n",
        "Fifty years later, it's still a delight with everybody working at the top of his or her game.\n",
        "The ultimate nostalgic source text is itself a pomo homage to a lost moment.\n",
        "There is no movie musical more fun than Singin' in the Rain, and few that remain as fresh over the years.\n",
        "Gene Kelly remains one of the best and brightest of the Golden Era musical stars and An American in Paris shows him in fine form.\n",
        "A grand show -- a brilliant combination of Hollywood's opulence and technical wizardry with the kind of taste and creativeness that most high-budgeted musicals notoriously lack.\n",
        "One of the most imaginative musical confections turned out by Hollywood in years.\n",
        "While not nearly the musical it's cracked up to be, this 1951 film is absolutely required viewing for anyone who wants to see the studio system (MGM style) at its gaudiest, most Byzantine height.\n",
        "A musical both ludicrously overpraised (especially in Hollywood) and underrated.\n",
        "...the picture takes on its glow of magic when Miss Caron is on the screen. When she isn't, it bumps along slowly as a patched-up, conventional musical show.\n",
        "The real reasons to see An American in Paris are for the Kelly dance sequences, the closing ballet, the Gershwin songs, the bright locations, and a few moments of the ineffable, always curiously sad charm of Oscar Levant.\n",
        "Sensation trumps cogitation-unsurprising in a Hollywood production-which doesn't negate the enduring allure of this beautiful bauble.\n",
        "...can clunk like a tin can in the dryer. But hey, we're talking Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire, so that's some mighty elegant slack we're willing to cut here.\n",
        "Funny Face...teams Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn in a delightfully balmy romance.\n",
        "It's as ditsy and delightful as ever - with charm enough to forgive it plenty.\n",
        "...the final scene, a tender sequence that you can sop up with a sponge, but if you aren't moved by it you probably stick kittens with pins.\n",
        "Out of the elusive, but curiously intoxicating Truman Capote fiction, scenarist George Axelrod has developed a surprisingly moving film, touched up into a stunningly visual motion picture.\n",
        "This story of a party girl in love with a gigolo allows [director Blake] Edwards to create a very handsome film, with impeccable Technicolor photography by Franz Planer.\n",
        "A completely unbelievable but wholly captivating flight into fancy composed of unequal dollops of comedy, romance, poignancy, funny colloquialisms and Manhattan's swankiest East Side areas captured in the loveliest of colors.\n",
        "For those who considers themselves romantics, or for anyone who just enjoys a simple love story from time-to-time, Breakfast at Tiffany's offers a few simple pleasures.\n",
        "Hitchcock's most tender story.\n",
        "The old master, now a slave to television, has turned out another Hitchcock-and-bull story in which the mystery is not so much who done it as who cares.\n",
        "One of the landmarks--not merely of the movies, but of 20th-century art.\n",
        "Why is this movie Hitchcock's masterpiece? Because no movie plunges us more deeply into the dizzying heart of erotic obsession.\n",
        "Slow but totally compelling.\n",
        "James Stewart, on camera almost constantly, comes through with a startlingly fine performance as the lawyer-cop who suffers from acrophobia.\n",
        "There is a glumness to the film that is notably missing from the director's other films of the period.\n",
        "One of the things that still amazes me about this movie is the way its study of obsession is so single-minded.\n",
        "You watch this guy going slowly over the brink and realize, good grief, this is Jimmy Stewart.\n",
        "It is about how Hitchcock used, feared and tried to control women.\n",
        "From a craft standpoint, Vertigo represents the director in peak form.\n",
        "With less playfulness and much more overt libido than other Hitchcock classics, Vertigo was always anomalous.\n",
        "Do yourself an aesthetic favor: Take the plunge.\n",
        "[A] fascinating mystery.\n",
        "In its dark heart, the film is a sorrowful contemplation of love and the veils that manipulate sexual passions.\n",
        "Hitchcock breezes through a tongue-in-cheek, nightmarish plot with a lightness of touch that's equalled by a charming performance from Grant.\n",
        "Smoothly troweled and thoroughly entertaining.\n",
        "A great film, and certainly one of the most entertaining movies ever made, directed by Alfred Hitchcock at his peak.\n",
        "At times it seems Hitchcock is kidding his own penchant for the bizarre, but this sardonic attitude is so deftly handled it only enhances the thrills.\n",
        "All in all, an improbable classic.\n",
        "... a colorful and exciting route for spies, counterspies and lovers.\n",
        "Of course, the hallmark of North by Northwest is the way in which Hitchcock develops tension.\n",
        "Hitchcock's ultimate wrong-man comedy.\n",
        "Wilder, a bilious and mercurial wit, here becomes a wide-screen master of time ...\n",
        "Directed by Wilder with attention to detail and emotional reticence that belie its inherent darkness and melodramatic core, it's lifted considerably by the performances.\n",
        "A comedy of men's-room humours and water-cooler politics that now and then among the belly laughs says something serious and sad about the struggle for success, about what it often does to a man, and about the horribly small world of big business.\n",
        "With tremendous performances by the two leads (Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine), this is yet another \"must see\" title to be found on Wilder's resume.\n",
        "Most of the time, it's up to director Wilder to sustain a two-hour-plus film on treatment alone, a feat he manages to accomplish more often than not, and sometimes the results are amazing.\n",
        "I wouldn't call this 1960 picture one of Billy Wilder's best comedies -- it's drab, sappy, and overlong at 125 minutes.\n",
        "Elevates the workplace romance into a sublime erotics of officious addresses (the omnipresent Mister and Miss) and economic conundrum.\n",
        "There is a melancholy gulf over the holidays between those who have someplace to go, and those who do not. The Apartment is so affecting partly because of that buried reason.\n",
        "A gleeful, tender and even sentimental film.\n",
        "Lemmon digs out most of the laughs in the script. As for Marilyn, she's been trimmer, slimmer and sexier in earlier pictures.\n",
        "The Great American Comedy (if you discount the Marx Brothers).\n",
        "Pictures like this, with a sense of humor that is as broad as it can be sophisticated, come along only infrequently.\n",
        "In many ways, the ultimate Billy Wilder film -- replete with breathless pacing, transvestite humor, and unflinching cynicism.\n",
        "One of Wilder's funniest satires.\n",
        "Some Like It Hot does cool off considerably now and again, but Mr. Wilder and his carefree clowns keep it crackling and funny most of the time.\n",
        "Wilder's 1959 comedy is one of the enduring treasures of the movies, a film of inspiration and meticulous craft.\n",
        "What's going on is sort of confused.\n",
        "A terrifically entertaining comedy-thriller.\n",
        "Firsttime teaming of Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, a natural, gives the sophisticated romantic caper an international appeal, plus the selling points of adventure, suspense and suberb comedy.\n",
        "Donen's typically slick comedy thriller, ingeniously scripted by Peter Stone, is a mammoth audience teaser.\n",
        "I tell you, this light-hearted picture is full of such gruesome violence.\n",
        "Made when the studio system was on its last legs, Charade still feels fresh, quick-witted, nothing like the artificial, airless Hollywood pictures of its time.\n",
        "Nobody lights a torch like Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa or carries one like Humphrey Bogart's Rick.\n",
        "Casablanca is the most sociable, the most companionable film ever made. Life as an endless party.\n",
        "Nothing short of an invasion could add much to Casablanca.\n",
        "Film should be a solid moneymaker everywhere.\n",
        "Part of what makes this wartime Hollywood drama (1942) about love and political commitment so fondly remembered is its evocation of a time when the sentiment of this country about certain things appeared to be unified.\n",
        "There are some great supporting performances, and much of the dialogue has become history.\n",
        "Across seven decades, the Humphrey Bogart-Ingrid Bergman starrer has emerged as Americans' default favorite movie.\n",
        "Yes, indeed, the Warners here have a picture which makes the spine tingle and the heart take a leap.\n",
        "The greatest pleasure anyone can derive from this movie comes through simply watching it.\n",
        "Seeing the film over and over again, year after year, I find it never grows over-familiar. It plays like a favorite musical album; the more I know it, the more I like it.\n",
        "The Maltese Falcon is the first crime melodrama with finish, speed and bang to come along in what seems ages.\n",
        "Frighteningly good evidence that the British (Alfred Hitchcock, Carol Reed, et al.) have no monopoly on the technique of making mystery films.\n",
        "The Maltese Falcon is among the most important and influential movies to emerge from the Hollywood system -- as significant in some ways as its contemporary, Citizen Kane.\n",
        "This is one of the best examples of actionful and suspenseful melodramatic story telling in cinematic form.\n",
        "Who can argue with Bogart's glower or Mary Astor in her ratty fur?\n",
        "Filmed almost entirely in interiors, it presents a claustrophobic world animated by betrayal, perversion and pain.\n",
        "Mr. Huston gives promise of becoming one of the smartest directors in the field.\n",
        "Among the movies we not only love but treasure, The Maltese Falcon stands as a great divide.\n",
        "Despite all reservations expressed, I must make clear that his fantastically successful show has been converted into a generally entertaining film.\n",
        "A marvelous restoration of the 30-year-old musical, precisely the kind of high-class popular entertainment that Hollywood can't seem to make these days.\n",
        "A stunningly effective screen entertainment.\n",
        "Lerner and Loewe's musical masterwork, reimagined for film by director George Cukor.\n",
        "Hepburn is clearly awkward as the Cockney Eliza in the first half, and in general the adaptation is a little too reverential to really come alive.\n",
        "All things considered, it is the brilliance of Miss Hepburn as the Cockney waif who is transformed by Prof. Henry Higgins into an elegant female facade that gives an extra touch of subtle magic and individuality to the film.\n",
        "The best stage musical of all time and one of the most loved romances.\n",
        "Few genres of films are as magical as musicals, and few musicals are as intelligent and lively as My Fair Lady.\n",
        "Literate, funny, brilliantly cast, with a score of Lerner and Loewe songs that does not include one dud.\n",
        "The newcomer named Audrey Hepburn gives the popular old romantic nonsense a reality it has seldom had before.\n",
        "For lovers of romantic comedies through the ages, Roman Holiday remains a favorite.\n",
        "[Wyler] times the chuckles with a never-flagging pace, puts heart into the laughs, endows the footage with some boff bits of business and points up some tender, poignant scenes in using the smart script and the cast to the utmost advantage.\n",
        "Wyler lays out all the elements with care and precision, but the romantic comedy never comes together -- it's charm by computer.\n",
        "The movie remains a great tonic.\n",
        "Mr. Wyler and his associates have fashioned a natural, tender, and amusing yarn about the heiress to the throne of a mythical kingdom who is sick unto death of an unending schedule of speeches, greetings, and interviews attendant on her goodwill tour...\n",
        "The film itself is a classic of romantic wish fulfillment, exactly the sort of beautiful lie that Hollywood specialized in.\n",
        "One of the first films to integrate musical numbers into the plot, it explores, without condescension or simplemindedness, the feelings that drive the family members apart and then bring them back together again.\n",
        "Garland achieves true stature with her deeply understanding performance, while her sisterly running-mate, Lucille Bremer, likewise makes excellent impact with a well-balanced performance.\n",
        "One of the great musicals.\n",
        "The joys of the film linger with the music and encourage you to savor the true moments of family togetherness.\n",
        "In the words of one of the gentlemen, it is a ginger-peachy show.\n",
        "In truth, any opportunity to see the film on the big screen is welcome.\n",
        "The blend of old-fashioned, classic storytelling with cutting-edge technology is undeniably enthralling.\n",
        "The result is quite stunning and a lot less gimmicky than it could have been.\n",
        "Knowing that it was made without a single computer, and entirely by human ingenuity, makes it all the more worthy of marveling at, 75 years and an added dimension later.\n",
        "Any reason to show your children \"The Wizard of Oz\" on a big screen seems like a good one.\n",
        "Even swollen to IMAX size, the movie is sharper than you've ever seen it, and the vaudevillian brilliance of the choreography (and Ray Bolger's straw-boned tumbling) is entirely undiminished.\n",
        "\"The Wizard of Oz\" celebrates its 75th anniversary looking younger and more vital than ever, simultaneously advertising good old-fashioned storytelling and the most advanced technology available.\n",
        "It looks fantastic, sounds great, and the 3-D effects (reportedly labored over for 16 months by a thousand technicians) are both subtle and respectfully applied.\n",
        "A work of almost staggering iconographic, mythological, creative and simple emotional meaning, at least for American audiences, this is one vintage film that fully lives up to its classic status.\n",
        "The story of course has some lovely and wild ideas, but the picture doesn't know what to do with them, except to be painfully literal and elaborate about everything.\n",
        "There is something new in the land of cinema at long last.\n",
        "One of only a handful of films that nearly everyone is familiar with.\n",
        "There's an audience for Oz wherever there's a projection machine and a screen.\n",
        "Lavish in sets, adult in humor, it is a Broadway spectacle translated into make-believe.\n",
        "I don't find the film light or joyful in the least -- an air of primal menace hangs about it, which may be why I love it.\n",
        "Oz simply lays bare primal emotions, exposes our childhood anxieties about abandonment and powerlessness and brings to light the tension between the repressive comforts of home and the liberating terrors of the unknown marking all our adult lives.\n",
        "Warner Home Video's DVD invites you to watch the movie a dozen more times on top of the many dozens of times you've already seen it.\n",
        "A delightful piece of wonder-working which had the youngsters' eyes shining and brought a quietly amused gleam to the wiser ones of the oldsters.\n",
        "It scared the hell out of me when I used to watch it between my fingers when I was a kid, and (though it might say too much about my own emotional development) I still get the heebie-jeebies from a lot of it.\n",
        "Its underlying story penetrates straight to the deepest insecurities of childhood, stirs them and then reassures them.\n",
        "It's remarkable that after spending almost eight hours of my existence in front of this film, I can remember only two points vividly.\n",
        "Gone With the Wind endures and deepens with the passing of time because Scarlett and Rhett are as modern as its open ending.\n",
        "One of the truly great films, destined for record-breaking boxoffice business everywhere.\n",
        "A critic-proof movie if there ever was one: it isn't all that good, but somehow it's great.\n",
        "What more can one say about this much-loved, much discussed blockbuster?\n",
        "The film that perhaps defines Hollywood.\n",
        "'It' has arrived at last, and we cannot get over the shock of not being disappointed; we had almost been looking forward to that.\n",
        "Everything old is new again with this re-release of Gone With the Wind, and it reminds us that the Golden Age of Hollywood was a beautiful time.\n",
        "They just don't make 'em like that anymore.\n",
        "On the whole, I thought the picture was OK.\n",
        "The first new Technicolor print in 37 years, digital sound and moments of digitally cleaned-up footage scattered throughout its three hours and 42 minutes all make for a gorgeous sight-and-sound experience.\n",
        "It is still a towering landmark of film, quite simply because it tells a good story, and tells it wonderfully well.\n",
        "Let us say simply that there is something in most of us that will always treasure Selznick's flair for old-fashioned, full-bodied narrative even as we pay lip service to the most anemic forms of cerebration in the modern cinema.\n",
        "It is a bore.\n",
        "Undoubtedly still the best and most durable piece of popular entertainment to have come off the Hollywood assembly lines.\n",
        "Even though the habits of movie- goers have changed over the years, it's easy to see why this film provoked such an outpouring of praise and adulation during its initial release, and why its stature has grown with the passage of decades.\n",
        "But once the story kicks in and Leigh and Gable slip into their characters, it's difficult not to be caught up in what is still one of the most vivid depictions of civil war (and its destructive aftermath) ever committed to film.\n",
        "To see Gone With the Wind on a big screen again is to weep for the fearlessness with which Hollywood once believed the sublime was possible.\n",
        "A tour de force for Swanson and one of Wilder's better efforts.\n",
        "...They rate a nod for daring, as well as credit for an all-around filmmaking job that, disregarding the unpleasant subject matter, is a standout.\n",
        "One of Wilder's finest, and certainly the blackest of all Hollywood's scab-scratching accounts of itself.\n",
        "Still the best Hollywood movie ever made about Hollywood.\n",
        "What's not recognized enough is the indelible, self-sickened performance of William Holden as Desmond's boy-toy/hired hack.\n",
        "This is the greatest film about Hollywood ever put on celluloid by Hollywood.\n",
        "Remains the best drama ever made about the movies because it sees through the illusions, even if Norma doesn't.\n",
        "While all the acting is memorable, one always thinks first and mostly of Miss Swanson, of her manifestation of consuming pride, her forlorn despair and a truly magnificent impersonation of Charlie Chaplin.\n",
        "Though it fails as drama, Stanley Kubrick's venture succeeds as dazzling visual art.\n",
        "2001 lingers on the mind like a tall, black riddle: Where are the new bones, the new tools, that will take us higher? Do we even deserve them?\n",
        "Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is some sort of great film, and an unforgettable endeavor. Technically and imaginatively, what he put into it is staggering.\n",
        "The film's projections of the cold war and antiquated product placements may look quaint now, but the poetry is as hard-edged and full of wonder as ever.\n",
        "It was a freshening attitude then, though its long-term effects haven't been all to the good.\n",
        "For all the essential coldness of Kubrick's vision, it demands attention as superior sci-fi, simply because it's more concerned with ideas than with Boy's Own-style pyrotechnics.\n",
        "It is an extraordinary, obsessive, beautiful work of art.\n",
        "Yup, you guessed it -- a religious experience.\n",
        "Now, seen in the actual 2001, it's less a visionary masterpiece than a crackpot Looney Tune, pretentious, abysmally slow, amateurishly acted and, above all, wrong.\n",
        "You can watch 2001 as a visual journey with nary a thought for what's under the surface or you can plunge into this vortex of interpretations. The great thing about 2001 is that either approach works fine. That's why it endures.\n",
        "2001 compares with, but does not best, previous efforts at science fiction.\n",
        "The film creates its effects essentially out of visuals and music. It is meditative. It does not cater to us, but wants to inspire us, enlarge us.\n",
        "The movie is so completely absorbed in its own problems, its use of color and space, its fanatical devotion to science-fiction detail, that its is somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring.\n",
        "A cold, majestic motion picture, a movie that seeks to remind us of the vastness of space and our relatively insignificant place in it.\n",
        "I assumed that this was what all movies ought to be: treasures for moral and aesthetic contemplation that did not provide all their answers on first contact.\n",
        "Joseph Mankiewicz was Hollywood's midcentury master of comic drama, and All About Eve, from 1950, was one of his signal achievements.\n",
        "What makes the picture seem so good (what makes it eminently worth seeing) is the satirical touches in its detail and the performance of Bette Davis.\n",
        "It crackles with smart, smarting dialogue.\n",
        "The Zanuck production investiture is plush in every department.\n",
        "[Features] more quotable dialogue in one movie than most screenwriters manage in a lifetime.\n",
        "The hoped-for tone of Restoration comedy never quite materializes, perhaps because Mankiewicz's cynicism is only skin-deep, but the film's tinny brilliance still pleases.\n",
        "Mankiewicz's flair for dialog is so perfected that all three actresses shoot fireworks whenever they open their mouths.\n",
        "A fine Darryl Zanuck production, excellent music and an air of ultra-class complete this superior satire. The legitimate theatre had better look to its laurels.\n",
        "A motion picture that, because of its priceless dialogue and unforgettable lead performance, will never lose its luster.\n",
        "Is there anyone alive who hasn't seen All About Eve -- anyone who doesn't love movies, that is?\n",
        "Mankiewicz's 1950 gem is a wickedly cynical cocktail of laughter and deceit in which everyone has an angle to play.\n",
        "[Bette Davis'] veteran actress Margo Channing in \"All About Eve\" (1950) was her greatest role.\n",
        "The classic 1939 film adaptation... worth seeing again and again. This is not.\n",
        "I love women in real life but at the movies I hated The Women.\n",
        "The funniest thing about The Women is that Mick Jagger is one of the producers. There was a knowing laugh in the theatre as his name sprang up in the opening credits -- our last chance to laugh, as it turned out, for the next two hours.\n",
        "One of the worst movies I've ever seen.\n",
        "In the end, English just wants to make a nice chick flick with some sassy lines. Genuine nastiness has been eliminated, while not-very-funny banter is retained.\n",
        "Though aspects of the 1939 comedy seem silly and shrill now, they were at least consistently entertaining. Where the original was deliciously loopy and melodramatic fun, this one is watered-down, sappy and earnest.\n",
        "What was then snappy dialogue from meowing madams acting out a morality play on everything that stinks about haute society now flaccidly flaps, lost in translation from old world to new.\n",
        "While the actors do what they can, too many characters come off as concepts, not people.\n",
        "Even those who never saw Cukor's movie will feel something is missing in English's version. Yes, some of what's missing is humor and snappy dialogue, but that could be forgiven, if only some of the characters were more believable.\n",
        "You go, girls. Preferably as far away as possible.\n",
        "English has shown herself to be an adept, perceptive, and at times funny writer, but too little of that is on display here.\n",
        "The tried-and-true characters still strike sparks. And even if the best parts are warmed over, the dish is still great.\n",
        "A total disaster.\n",
        "It's not every movie that makes you wish Vin Diesel would run in and start blowing up stuff.\n",
        "Fourteen years in the making, The Women marks a serviceable directorial debut for English.\n",
        "Of all the freedoms that women have rightly earned, aping the worst of male behaviour needn't rank high among them.\n",
        "Hopefully that audience won't be fooled by this cast's potential and the clever concept; the final product here is anything but fabulous.\n",
        "In spite of the casting and honorable revamps, it feels more dated than the 1939 original did for its time period.\n",
        "It hurts especially to watch Ms. Bening and Candice Bergen (who plays Mary's mother) lend their wit and dignity to a project that has so little of its own.\n",
        "What a pleasure this movie is, showcasing actresses I've admired for a long time, all at the top of their form.\n",
        "This time Hitchcock does it all his way, does a splendid job and has a splendid cast to do it with.\n",
        "One of the finest productional efforts of the past year.\n",
        "Through its first two-thirds it is as perfect a myth of adolescence as any of the Disney films, documenting the childlike, nameless heroine's initiation into the adult mysteries of sex, death, and identity.\n",
        "Hitchcock shows superb technical control and attends to his trademark motifs, from monstrous mother figures to the fetishisation of clothing.\n",
        "An altogether brilliant film, haunting, suspenseful, handsome and handsomely played.\n",
        "The result exhibits that the director is capable of a range few would credit him with.\n",
        "This film contains one of Hitchcock's most famous set pieces -- an assassination in the rain -- but otherwise remains a second-rate effort, as immensely enjoyable as it is.\n",
        "Story is essentially the old cops-and-robbers. But it has been set in a background of international political intrigue of the largest order.\n",
        "Into it Director Alfred Hitchcock, whose unmistakable stamp the picture bears, has packed about as much romantic action, melodramatic hullabaloo, comical diversion and illusion of momentous consequence as the liveliest imagination could conceive.\n",
        "Hitchcock's espionage thriller is a thoroughly enjoyable affair, complete with some of his most memorable set pieces.\n",
        "As mainstream hip hop becomes ever more predictable, so do the biopics about its stars.\n",
        "Even if we miss the thinking that went into the creation of Wallace's B.I.G.-ger-than-life alter ego, the movie's performances are exultant.\n",
        "The movie leaves us with the sense that, twelve years after Biggie Smalls's death, a lot of people are trying to extract whatever profit or pride they can from the chaotic life of a young man who was, as he well knew, a work in progress.\n",
        "If Milk set the standard for biopics in 2008, then 2009 is off to a strong start with Notorious.\n",
        "For a hardcore fan of his music and his life, it rings true.\n",
        "Notorious is like a piece of well-crafted bling. It looks good, and facets of it shine, but behind the gilded facade there's not much there.\n",
        "This tale of triumph and tragedy within hip hop's elite is intelligent, gripping and far less sensationalistic than anyone could have expected.\n",
        "The best thing about Notorious is its across-the-board, excellent cast, especially the soulful Woolard and Mackie's mesmerizing work as the complex Shakur.\n",
        "It must have been an act of great restraint for Sean Combs to resist titling this film, about Chris Wallace, his close friend turned rapper and cultural icon, The Notorious B.I.G. -- The Sean Combs Story.\n",
        "Notorious is surprisingly and pleasantly unflashy, a straightforward picture that makes a distinction between classiness and bling.\n",
        "George Tillman Jr.'s film may follow the well-worn path of many a musical biography. But spot-on casting, a light touch around the edges and affection for its subject makes this warts-and-all look at the big man with the big hits a winner.\n",
        "The script lets too much slide, and director George Tillman Jr. -- whose biggest films have been Soul Food and the Barbershop franchise -- abets it.\n",
        "Closer to Scorsese than Scarface, Notorious gives a heartfelt yet clear-eyed sendoff to the late Brooklyn rapper Christopher Wallace, aka Biggie Smalls aka the Notorious B.I.G.\n",
        "It's unlikely there will be a better dramatization of the Biggie Smalls story than this one.\n",
        "Notorious obviously loves its protagonist, but the movie can't get past its own starstruck awe.\n",
        "Notorious has a fine time along the way, with Woolard channeling the rapper's sweetness and wit as comfortably as his pathos.\n",
        "A vivid biopic of the larger-than-life rap star that doesn't require you be a big fan of the genre.\n",
        "This flick smoothes out the roughest edges, drains off the rawness and blandly retraces the narrative arc of every musical biopic since The Jazz Singer.\n",
        "Notorious is a game of dress-up, the Greatest Hits version of Biggie's life. But in the end, it fails to present a convincing argument of why we should care.\n",
        "Notorious, directed by George Tillman Jr. with a sentimental touch, seems torn.\n",
        "Not to be speechless about it, David O. Selznick has a rare film in Spellbound.\n",
        "Mr. McCarey's direction is unpropitiously and unaccountably slow.\n",
        "It is a significant dud, and Grace Kelly's role has the virtue of making clearer the quality which excited so much attention in previous roles.\n",
        "To Catch a Thief does nothing but give out a good, exciting time. If you'll settle for that at a movie, you should give it your custom right now.\n",
        "Alfred Hitchcock's fluffy 1955 exercise in light comedy, minimal mystery, and good-natured eroticism (the fireworks scene is a classic).\n",
        "Neither the '90s nor the husband-wife team of Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer (they wrote the new version, she co-produced, he directed) can match the original film's grace or wit.\n",
        "Best stuff here comes strsight from Martin, such as his frenzied antics in the in-laws' house or his ridiculous Tom Jones imitation in front of a mirror in a too-tight tuxedo.\n",
        "Some sequences and dialogue are lifted directly from the original, but in the wider context, this merely serves to underline the remake's comparative lack of tenderness and subtlety.\n",
        "The material has been successfully refurbished with new jokes and new attitudes, but the earlier film's most memorable moments have been preserved.\n",
        "[A] slight but delightfully sweet-natured new comedy starring Steve Martin.\n",
        "This is a movie with heart, and there are little moments in it when Martin is deeply moved by the fact that this perfect creature he brought into the world is now going to start a family of her own.\n",
        "After a provocative setup, this Touchstone Pictures offering pads innocuously down the aisle, a remake that doesn't touch the Spencer Tracy classic of the same name.\n",
        "This feel-good finale might feel even better, though, if it had any true connection to the pat, amiable, and rather dawdling farce that preceded it.\n",
        "The musical becomes a frenetic meditation on pop art versus high art, coming down hard on the side of the former.\n",
        "This one is neither crude clowning nor crude prejudice, but a literate and knowingly directed satire which lands many a shrewd crack about phony Five Year Plans, collective farms, Communist jargon and pseudo-scientific gab.\n",
        "Ninotchka is delicate flirtation and political satire made into a perfect whole, and a reminder of skills that studio writers have largely lost.\n",
        "Selection of Ernst Lubitsch to pilot Garbo in her first light performance in pictures proves a bull's-eye.\n",
        "The satire may be mostly a matter of easy contrasts, but the lovers inhabit a world of elegance and poise that is uniquely and movingly Lubitsch's.\n",
        "It's still consistently amusing, and Garbo throws herself into the fray with engaging vigour.\n",
        "One of the sprightliest comedies of the year.\n",
        "The production holds enchantment and delight in substantial quantity.\n",
        "As Andrew Sarris says, not without its cruelties, but not without its beauties as well.\n",
        "An over-long and only spasmodically amusing romantic comedy...\n",
        "It's the closest Wilder ever came to Ernst Lubitsch.\n",
        "This film was produced by Mr. Wilder for Allied Artists -- in black-and-white. It is a hit.\n",
        "The performances are well nigh faultless.\n",
        "Gigi is dressed to kill, but if all the French finery impresses the customers, it also smothers the story.\n",
        "It's easy to drift away from the story and become absorbed in Minnelli's impossibly delicate textures, but there is a little something here for everybody.\n",
        "It's like a meal consisting of cheesecake, and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down.\n",
        "A charming entertainment.\n",
        "The Mask of Zorro stands as a pointed riposte to those who say they don't make 'em like that anymore.\n",
        "The story is not important. The clash of swords, the leaps, the tumbles -- it's all very nice. But after 136 minutes, it becomes a bit much.\n",
        "Banderas and Hopkins prove that there's life in the Z-boy yet, but by leaving in the dull patches, the filmmakers may find audiences catching zzzzzs in ways they never intended.\n",
        "A lively, old-fashioned adventure yarn with just a twist of modern attitude, it's the kind of pleasant entertainment that allows the paying customers to have as much fun as the people on screen.\n",
        "One of the most glorious and rousing adventure movies Hollywood has ever produced.\n",
        "With a wealth of charismatic Zorros (two), a smashing heroine and a dauntless love of adventure, this is hot-weather escapism so earnestly retrograde that it seems new.\n",
        "Offers just what one might reasonably expect from a Zorro movie: a great deal of excitement and adventure, all brought to the screen by using a somewhat irreverent tone that keeps the mood light without trivializing the characters.\n",
        "The Mask of Zorro has something you don't often see in modern action pictures: a sense of honor.\n",
        "Banderas, with his flashing eyes, makes a good mock-Hidalgo, but the movie would be a lot more amusing if it weren't such kid stuff.\n",
        "Few movies make you feel dirtier, and so perversely grateful for the pleasure.\n",
        "A highly polished and debonair whodunit.\n",
        "Less a crime film than a study in levels of obsession, Laura is one of those classic works that leave their subject matter behind and live on the strength of their seductive style.\n",
        "A hypnotic and deathlessly interpretable experience.\n",
        "Gene Tierney makes an appealing figure as the art executive and Vincent Price is convincing as a weak-willed ne'er-do-well.\n",
        "The plot is deliberately perfunctory, the people deliciously perverse, and the mise-en-scene radical.\n",
        "The picture on the whole is close to being a top-drawer mystery.\n",
        "The materials of a B-grade crime potboiler are redeemed by Waldo Lydecker, walking through every scene as if afraid to step in something.\n",
        "Finally, thanks more to Fred Astaire than any other single influence, the character of musicomedy in the cinema has now completely changed.\n",
        "This one can't miss and the reasons are three -- Fred Astaire, Irving Berlin's 11 songs and sufficient comedy between numbers to hold the film together.\n",
        "This 1935 musical finds Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers at the top of their form.\n",
        "The third Astaire-Rogers movie and one of the best.\n",
        "Because we are bound by gravity and the limitations of our bodies, because we live in a world where the news is often bad and the prospects disturbing, there is a need for another world somewhere, a world where Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers live.\n",
        "The plot is involving, especially as it builds to its seemingly impossible-to-solve finale.\n",
        "All the minor players are such skilled comedians that they are able to extract merriment from this none too original comedy of errors.\n",
        "To Be is a very funny comedy, salted to taste with melodrama and satire.\n",
        "Lubitsch's guidance provides a tense dramatic pace with events developed deftly and logically throughout.\n",
        "It's certainly one of the finest comedies ever to come out of Paramount.\n",
        "To say it is callous and macabre is understating the case.\n",
        "One of the most profound, emotionally complex comedies ever made, covering a range of tones from satire to slapstick to shocking black humor.\n",
        "Terribly funny.\n",
        "My Man Godfrey emerges with that evasive quality that is not skillful playing, writing or direction, but something that mysteriously adds itself to these things, and makes a tip-top picture.\n",
        "[A] screwball masterpiece.\n",
        "God, but this film is beautiful.\n",
        "Gregory La Cava's improvisational style received its highest critical acclaim for this 1936 film, a marginally Marxist exercise in class confusion during the Depression.\n",
        "William Powell and Carole Lombard are pleasantly teamed in this splendidly produced comedy.\n",
        "The film has lost some of its allure over the years, but it's still streets and streets ahead of the addled whimsy favoured by latter-day Hollywood.\n",
        "There may be a sober moment or two in the picture; there may be a few lines of the script that do not pack a laugh. Somehow we cannot remember them.\n",
        "An excellent film which registers strongly on all levels, whether it's in its breathtaking panoramic shots of the dusty Texas plains; the personal, dramatic impact of the story itself, or the resounding message it has to impart.\n",
        "Much of it is awful, but it's almost impossible not to be taken in by the narrative sprawl.\n",
        "Stevens' sprawling epic of Texan life, taken from Edna Ferber's novel, strives so hard for Serious Statements that it ends up as a long yawn.\n",
        "A real movie is big, grand, magnificent and regales you with all the power that movies can wield upon a viewer's imagination and spirit. George Stevens' 1956 production, Giant, is a real movie.\n",
        "Giant, for all its complexity, is a strong contender for the year's top-film award.\n",
        "At 202 minutes, it's just too long, yet it has the pull of nostalgia (if you're of a certain age) and sustains its emotional impact as a portrait of a durable marriage.\n",
        "Although Giant may not be a classic in the purest sense of the word, it's a fine example of a virtually-extinct genre.\n",
        "John Steinbeck's painful biblical allegory -- Genesis replayed in Monterey, California, circa 1917 -- is more palatable on the screen, thanks to the down-to-earth performances of James Dean as Cal/Cain and Richard Davalos as Aron/Abel.\n",
        "It's a film of great performances, atmospheric photography, and a sure sense of period and place.\n",
        "Not only one of Kazan's richest films and Dean's first significant role, it is also arguably the actor's best performance.\n",
        "In short, there is energy and intensity but little clarity and emotion in this film. It is like a great, green iceberg: mammoth and imposing but very cold.\n",
        "One of the most popular comedies ever made.\n",
        "The Thin Man was an entertaining novel, and now it's an entertaining picture.\n",
        "What enchants, really, is the relationship between Nick and Nora as they live an eternal cocktail hour, bewailing hangovers that only another little drink will cure, in a marvellous blend of marital familiarity and constant courtship.\n",
        "An excellent combination of comedy and excitement.\n",
        "The Thin Man was one of the most popular films of 1934, inspired five sequels, and was nominated for four Oscars (best picture, actor, direction and screenplay). Yet it was made as an inexpensive B-picture.\n",
        "One is tempted to throw away any semblance of persuasion and simply demand that you go see this movie.\n",
        "The movie bears reviewing because there's always something new in the confetti of one-liners, while its depiction of the Fourth Estate remains relevant.\n",
        "Cary Grant's performance is truly virtuoso -- stunning technique applied to the most challenging material.\n",
        "Casting is excellent, with Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in the top roles.\n",
        "Perhaps the funniest, certainly the fastest talkie comedy ever made.\n",
        "It takes you by the scruff of the neck in the first reel and it shakes you madly, bellowing hoarsely the. while, for the remaining six or seven. Before it's over you don't know whether you have been laughing or having your ears boxed.\n",
        "Amiably dorky redo.\n",
        "It was exactly what I expected and that's something I didn't really want to see.\n",
        "Around the World in 80 Days is never as delightful and silly as it needs to be.\n",
        "The gags are physical but rarely funny.\n",
        "Despite the rush to get everyone from place to place, director Frank Coraci luxuriates in colorful visual detail and gives the locals their due.\n",
        "Has that cheesy, chintzy mid-Florida feel that we all know and love, despite its $110 million budget.\n",
        "This second bigscreen version of Jules Verne's 1873 novel takes plenty of liberties with the material and never generates much genuine excitement, but provides an agreeable ride without overloading it with contemporary filmmaking mannerisms.\n",
        "Plays like a listless '60s overseas co-production.\n",
        "Jules Verne is rotating in his grave worrying about his other works ripe for plucking from the public domain.\n",
        "Properly silly and slapsticky.\n",
        "An energetic and enormously good-natured family movie.\n",
        "Offers only snooze-worthy action scenes.\n",
        "Feel[s] like a future ride at the Magic Kingdom.\n",
        "A journey worth taking.\n",
        "This $110-million fiasco is the sort of movie that gives family entertainment a bad name.\n",
        "One of the lamest remakes of a classic film I've ever seen.\n",
        "The most well-loved of all Christmas movies.\n",
        "It's a Wonderful Life is about hunger. It's about greed. It's about the many ways a good man is stymied. Finally, it's about George Bailey, whose decency prevents him even from killing himself.\n",
        "Capra is an old-time movie craftsman, the master of every trick in the bag, and in many ways he is more at home with the medium than any other Hollywood director. But all of his details give the impression of contrived effect.\n",
        "It's a Wonderful Life is a pretty wonderful movie.\n",
        "The epiphany of movie sentiment and a transcendent experience.\n",
        "The April-air wholesomeness and humanism of this natural bring back vividly the reminder that, essentially, the screen best offers unselfconscious, forthright entertainment.\n",
        "Regardless of whether or not you believe in angels, it's a wonderful movie.\n",
        "As the hero, Mr. Stewart does a warmly appealing job, indicating that he has grown in spiritual stature as well as in talent during the years he was in the war. And Donna Reed is remarkably poised and gracious as his adoring sweet-heart and wife.\n",
        "Combine the characters, the story, the message, and the acting, and it's easy to see why It's a Wonderful Life isn't just a holiday favorite, but a great movie by almost any standards.\n",
        "What is remarkable about It's a Wonderful Life is how well it holds up over the years; it's one of those ageless movies, like Casablanca or The Third Man, that improves with age.\n",
        "Mr. Smith captures ground-level political machinations in an utterly fascinating way. The question raised by the title makes for an interesting, if possibly disheartening, debate.\n",
        "For all its rah-rah David-vs.-Goliath populism, Can Mr. Smith understands that even an uncorrupted outsider like Smith must master the art of campaign gamesmanship to be successful.\n",
        "Can Mr. Smith Get to Washington Anymore? is an amusing case study in youthful enthusiasm for the electoral process, but this modest documentary skips the weighty issues posed by its namesake, the Frank Capra 1939 drama.\n",
        "[Director Frank] Popper sticks close to the fierce campaigner and his young, mostly inexperienced staffers, capturing all the energy, idealism, dour humor, and unreasoning hope of a Cinderella candidacy.\n",
        "The movie is breezy, fun and keeps comin' at ya. Politics needs more of this and less of what went on in Ohio.\n",
        "A rousing, sometimes funny, frequently depressing documentary.\n",
        "Although the outcome is public record, pic is undeniably gripping as it reveals a distressing degree of voter complacency.\n",
        "Director Frank Popper has made a lively, engaging nail-biter of a film that recalls The War Room in its candor, intimacy and breathless pace.\n",
        "The enduring fascination of this 1938 screwball comedy is due to much more than its uproarious gags.\n",
        "A perfect example of why directors (and even us brilliant professional critics) can often be completely in the dark about what works.\n",
        "There is little rhyme or reason to most of the action, but it's all highly palatable.\n",
        "Though it's almost impossible, try to sit back sometime and enjoy this 1938 Howard Hawks masterpiece not only for its gags, but for the grace of its construction, the assurance of its style, and the richness of its themes.\n",
        "One of the finest screwball comedies ever.\n",
        "The speedy, 102-minute film is a total delight, and the performances are so invigorating that it can withstand many multiple viewings without losing its sparks.\n",
        "If you've never been to the movies, Bringing Up Baby will be all new to you -- a zany-ridden product of the goofy farce school. But who hasn't been to the movies?\n",
        "George Stevens' direction and the excellence of the stars' playing make the film.\n",
        "This is a classic 'women's picture' in every sense.\n",
        "If you are prone to easy weeping, you might even take along a washtub.\n",
        "If you have any tolerance for soap opera, this is one of the classics.\n",
        "Gallant trouping by Barbara Stanwyck, colorful background provided by Stromberg, and speedy direction by William Wellman, carry picture through for good entertainment for general audiences.\n",
        "Nothing more than a mystery melodrama with a backstage setting. Not a good mystery exercise either.\n",
        "Although a stream of hard-boiled wisecracks keeps things amusing, the plot gets tied up in the usual dreary whodunit business of providing motives for all and sundry.\n",
        "It isn't without some zip, though you have to wonder why the producers bothered when the censors demanded that the dancers be shown only from the neck up.\n",
        "In Hitchcock's hands, however, this well-known espionage adventure provided the basis for a new sort of thriller and a new sort of comedy.\n",
        "At 35, with more than a dozen features already under his belt, the director triumphed with this dazzling mixture of spycraft, banter, expository nonsense and manic chases along the Scottish Highlands.\n",
        "It's melodrama and at times far-fetched and improbable, but the story twists and spins artfully from one high-powered sequence to another while the entertainment holds like steel cable from start to finish.\n",
        "As an artist, Alfred Hitchcock surpassed this early achievement many times in his career, but for sheer entertainment value it still stands in the forefront of his work.\n",
        "Great fun.\n",
        "If you can imagine Anatole France writing a detective story you will have some notion of the artistry that Hitchcock brings to this screen version of John Buchan's novel.\n",
        "If [Romero's] original vision of the undead looks dulled by today's standards, his embedded political commentary on racism feels just as sharp.\n",
        "Although pic's basic premise is repellent -- recently dead bodies are resurrected and begin killing human beings in order to eat their flesh -- it is in execution that the film distastefully excels.\n",
        "George Romero's remarkably assured debut, made on a shoestring, about a group of people barricaded inside a farmhouse while an army of flesh-eating zombies roams the countryside, deflates all genre cliches.\n",
        "Over its short, furious course, the picture violates so many strong taboos -- cannibalism, incest, necrophilia -- that it leaves audiences giddy and hysterical.\n",
        "I felt real terror in that neighborhood theater last Saturday afternoon. I saw kids who had no resources they could draw upon to protect themselves from the dread and fear they felt.\n",
        "Chuckle, if you can, during the first few minutes; because after that laughter catches in the throat as the clammy hand of terror tightens its grip.\n",
        "The dialogue and background music sound hollow, as if they had been recorded in an empty swimming pool, and the wobbly camera seems to have a fetishist's interest in hands.\n",
        "Five minutes in, and cowriter-director John Huston has already set the stage for something besides your typical '50s jungle-bwana boogie.\n",
        "It is a picture with an unassuming warmth and naturalness...\n",
        "The direction is often questionable, but the screenplay (by James Agee, John Collier, Huston, and Peter Viertel from C.S. Forester's novel) is a model of tight construction.\n",
        "Impossible to deny this film's entertainment value...\n",
        "And so Mr. Huston merits credit for putting this fantastic tale on a level of sly, polite kidding and generally keeping it there, while going about the happy business of engineering excitement and visual thrills.\n",
        "If Beat the Devil puzzled audiences on its first release, it has charmed them since.\n",
        "he film ranges from the diffident to the grotesque, with Huston selecting his lenses to make the performers look as freakish as possible.\n",
        "A formaldehyded tabby that sits static while layer after layer of its skin is peeled off, life after life of its nine lives unsentimentally destroyed.\n",
        "An intense, important motion picture.\n",
        "Burl Ives and Judith Anderson are highly entertaining as the nightmare parents, Big Daddy and Big Mama, and Jack Carson has one of his last good roles as Newman's competitive older brother.\n",
        "As so often with adaptations of Williams, it frequently errs on the side of overstatement and pretension, but still remains immensely enjoyable as a piece of cod-Freudian codswallop.\n",
        "What a pack of trashy people these accomplished actors perform!\n",
        "This picture tries to please everybody. It won't.\n",
        "An engrossing romantic drama that tells a good story with fine performances and an overall honesty of dramatic purpose.\n",
        "What is to be said of such a picture? The story is trite. The motivations are thin. The writing is glossy and pedestrian. The acting is pretty much forced.\n",
        "An enjoyable (if heavy-handed) melodrama.\n",
        "Essential viewing.\n",
        "Both a how-to manual for guerrilla terrorism and a cautionary tale about how to fight it. It's also quite possibly the finest war film ever made.\n",
        "It's a dedicated effort with importance as a 'document.'\n",
        "Superb and unrivalled.\n",
        "What lessons a modern viewer can gain from the film depends on who is watching and what they want to see.\n",
        "It's as fresh and suspenseful as anything before or since.\n",
        "The most electrifyingly timely movie playing in New York was made in 1965.\n",
        "An extraordinary movie that ruffled many feathers when it first came out. Almost 40 years later, it retains the poignancy it delivered back then.\n",
        "An epic of intimate objectivity.\n",
        "Remains a signficant achievement, a testament to film's powers to put you in the middle of a historical event and make it feel real.\n",
        "Pontecorvo essentially established the cinematic language that we recognize in recent dramas based on actual events, from Bloody Sunday to Black Hawk Down.\n",
        "Gripping and technically dazzling documentary-style drama.\n",
        "Magnificent moviemaking.\n",
        "The chafing, mutually uncomprehending collision of Western occupiers and Muslim occupied has never been captured with such dispassionate, thrilling clarity.\n",
        "Few movies have done such an eloquent, evenhanded job of defining the conflict between colonialists and natives determined to free themselves from foreign rule.\n",
        "The director's real achievement is not in making a piece of agitprop but in using these fundamental tools of cinema in such an extraordinarily affecting way.\n",
        "The greatness of The Battle of Algiers lies in its ability to embrace moral ambiguity without succumbing to it.\n",
        "The 'smell of truth' that Pontecorvo said he was after in this film has never left it, and likely never will.\n",
        "A classic of politically engaged filmmaking.\n",
        "You won't soon forget the face of Brahim Haggiag, who plays the revolutionary leader Ali as if he were channeling the misery of colonialism into a solitary stare of accusatory outrage.\n",
        "One of the loveliest of Nick Ray's movies.\n",
        "Clunky and awkward, with inane dialogue, it's a movie to show how attitudes have changed.\n",
        "From bumbling infants to majestic adults, a flock hasn't been this charismatic onscreen since Hitchcock went bird-watching.\n",
        "Writer/director Lance Young is so relentlessly solemn ... that some viewers may giggle.\n",
        "It's a visceral delight that refuses to be deterred by niceties of plot or character consistency and prefers sweat to emotion.\n",
        "A standard Van Damme pic, competently assembled but with little of the manic edge found in director Lam's Hong Kong movies.\n",
        "There are so many car crashes in Maximum Risk that Van Damme ends up playing second fiddle to an ever-expanding salvage operation.\n",
        "Lam not only handles the bravura action set pieces with ease but also a capable international cast as colorful and varied as the film's many locales.\n",
        "The chases are chaotic and cliched.\n",
        "Action flicks should be fun, and this one is a bloody bore.\n",
        "The generic nature of the plot and action sequences, not to mention the presence of Jean-Claude Van Damme, made everything seem all-too-familiar.\n",
        "From start to finish, Maximum Risk presents spectacular stunts choreographed and coordinated by Charles Picerni and some hair-raising, stomach-churning automotive chases attributed to Remy Julienne, the French master of the art.\n",
        "It just simmers down, becoming an embarrassing exercise in the pointless and predictable.\n",
        "There are pain and honor in [Neeson's] performance, and they constantly rise up to redeem a film that is less probing, less thoughtful than its director's claims and aspirations for it.\n",
        "Intelligent, enormously accomplished and seriously problematic, Neil Jordan's ambitious account of the activities of arguably the central figure in Ireland's painful, bloody fight for independence from the British Empire has a great deal to offer...\n",
        "This is Jordan's most ambitious and satisfying movie -- a thriller with a real sense of scale, pace, menace and moral import.\n",
        "Played with great magnetism and triumphant bluster by Liam Neeson, the film's Michael Collins easily lives up to his nickname.\n",
        "Handsome, but curiously cold, considering the emotional heat of Anglo-Irish matters. Fortunately, Liam Neeson commands almost every frame.\n",
        "Jordan always had 6-foot-4 Liam Neeson in mind to play the man they called \"the Big Fellow,\" and it's more than size that makes Neeson fit the part of a leader known for his \"cloudburst temperament.\"\n",
        "Collins, who died at 31, was arguably the key figure in the struggles that led to the separation of Ireland and Britain. He was also, on the basis of this film, a man able to use violence without becoming intoxicated by it.\n",
        "While Michael Collins does distort elements of history, most of the changes and compressions are dramatically effective.\n",
        "Actor Matthew Broderick feature directorial debut is a stagnantly flawed, listless account of Richard Feyman, the brilliant American-Jewish scientist; it doesn't help that Patricia Arquette is miscast as his wife.\n",
        "A charming, delicate repast prepared by Stanley Tucci and Campbell Scott.\n",
        "A small movie -- and that's its subtle charm.\n",
        "A feast of a film done on a low budget with a menu featuring top-grade acting, writing and direction.\n",
        "As delicately and deliciously prepared as the dishes it features, Big Night is a lyric to the love of food, family and persuasive acting.\n",
        "By the end of the movie, we have been through an emotional and a sensual wringer, in a film of great wisdom and delight.\n",
        "A scrumptious tale of great food and grand passions.\n",
        "It will paste a big, sloppy smile on your face from its opening moment. Good luck at dislodging it.\n",
        "When it comes to seeing Big Night, two words say it all: Bon appetite!\n",
        "Stanley Tucci's surprise cinematic brainchild fills you up with its audacious originality.\n",
        "Influenced by Thelma & Louise and Waiting to Exhale, this well-crafted Girls N the Hood has social conscience and soul; Queen Latifah gives a career-making performance that should made her a big Hollywood star\n",
        "Overlong, overdone and overwrought, the narratively challenged Set It Off gets off on exploitation shock and social-conscience schlock in equal measure.\n",
        "To the director's credit, the actors all seem responsive to his touch, giving performances that are lively and flavorsome, if not deep or unlike anything each of them has done before.\n",
        "Herzfeld has a tolerable eye for filling a 'Scope frame but a tin ear when it comes to creating dialogue; these are all characters we've met before, and most even seem bored with themselves.\n",
        "Smoothly constructed, for such a busy piece of work, and Hatcher's ascent to stardom continues.\n",
        "A sleek, amusingly nasty screen debut by a film maker whose television credits include an Amy Fisher docudrama.\n",
        "Funny, pathetic, sad, absurdist -- writer-director John Herzfeld plays it any number of ways, and makes them all work.\n",
        "There are too many characters, but some are a lot of fun. The tone shifts, from graphic murder to wig-flipping farce, are too extreme, but much of it works.\n",
        "This produces some rather nasty-funny surprises.\n",
        "The plot underlies even the most inexplicable scenes and eventually links even the most widely separated characters, but what makes the movie fun is the dialogue and the behavior.\n",
        "It's pure entertainment -- nothing too serious, nothing too deep -- with an artistic sensibility.\n",
        "If you were expecting Mrs. Doubtfire in reverse, invest your interest elsewhere.\n",
        "Is it excusable to kill a few indigents here and there experimenting for a miracle cure? Measures' painfully protracted Hour 2 turns into a melodramatic debate about ethics.\n",
        "Although this slick Seagal action pic won't convert die-hard detractors, aficionados will note that he's both gained weight and lightened up.\n",
        "The plot of The Glimmer Man involves not only the Family Man but Our Evil Secret Government, the Russian Mafia and Rich Powerful Politicians -- the three stooges of action cinema in the '90s.\n",
        "Most of the action scenes occur in the dark and are so heavily edited, it's hard to know whose limbs and faces are being splintered by Cole.\n",
        "It's repetitive mayhem as usual.\n",
        "Just as foolish and formulaic as it sounds.\n",
        "All-in-all, what we have here is 'classic' Seagal. And that means, for anyone who isn't an admitted fan, an uninspired outing.\n",
        "A brutish action movie that is as improbable as it is annoying.\n",
        "Subtract the gruesomeness, the language and some nekkid stuff, and the film is indistinguishable from an episode of a TV cop show.\n",
        "It's ugly and unpleasant but you may find it intensely compelling, much like a visit to the oral surgeon.\n",
        "Nothing to quack about there.\n",
        "Lacking the surface glitz, attention-grabbing plot and star power of John Grisham's previous adaptations, Folley's film will also suffer due to comparisons with the similarly-themed and better Tim Robbins' Dead Man Walking, released last year.\n",
        "There isn't a whole lot to the movie.\n",
        "The traditional ingredients of homely moralising, sentimentality and raucous slapstick are used sparingly, the dialogue is fairly bright, some visual gags are neatly executed.\n",
        "Walt Disney started by making movies in which animated drawings played the parts of people or animals who stood for people. Later he turned to making movies in which people or animals play the parts of animated drawings.\n",
        "Everytime I see one of these antiseptic Disney films, I'm reminded of the thrills and genuine artistry that went into the studio's films during its golden age in the 1940s and 1950s.\n",
        "A Disney adventure with quite a lot going for it, even if it does end up spreading itself too wide for the sakes of the entire family.\n",
        "A Walt Disney production for children who will watch absolutely anything that moves.\n",
        "A scifi thriller that's fun, that's cheerfully implausible, that's scary but not too scary, and it works.\n",
        "The Love Bug is surely the first film in which the actors...are so meticulously insipid that a car can handily steal the show.\n",
        "For sheer inventiveness of situation and the charm that such an idea projects, The Love Bug rates as one of the better entries of the Disney organization.\n",
        "'Herbie' and his plucky stunt drivers steal the show in this agreeable family entertainment.\n",
        "Such a vulnerable movie that if it were a little less sappy, one might feel compelled to protect it, as if it were someone under 7 or over 65 -- that portion of the public for which it is intended.\n",
        "What this autopopathism means in terms of American culture is a subject I neither understand nor wish to.\n",
        "It comes from Disney's thoroughly proved mother lode: movies for the kids that adults will stay to enjoy themselves.\n",
        "Sentimental, yes, but also sturdy as a hickory stick.\n",
        "This 1998 romantic comedy mostly bores with its cumbersome exposition and close-ups of trivial objects scattered throughout lackluster montage sequences.\n",
        "New pic is slick, sentimental and exceptionally well cast, with enough cross-generational appeal to suggest strong commercial potential.\n",
        "The light comedy is sweetly timed, the direction smart and assured, and the visuals bright, colourful, unobtrusive and faultless.\n",
        "Movies like this remember how much fun escapism can be.\n",
        "The lavish, super-cute new version of The Parent Trap is a remake of the 1961 Hayley Mills hit, which was seriously adorable in its own right\n",
        "It never fails to amaze me that something as essentially light and pointless as Disney's remake of The Parent Trap can clock in at over two hours in length.\n",
        "Richardson and Quaid, who is beginning to resemble Harrison Ford in his rumpled mode, have great chemistry. It's a shame it takes so long for the movie to bring them together to demonstrate it.\n",
        "Responsibility for making this Trap tender rests heaviest on the bird-size shoulders of auburn-haired, freckle-faced Lohan, now 11, who won the unenviable job of making us forget about Hayley Mills -- at least temporarily.\n",
        "Pollyanna emerges on the wide screen as the best live-actor movie Disney has ever made: a Niagara of drivel and a masterpiece of smarm.\n",
        "Hayley Mills' work more than compensates for the film's lack of tautness and, at certain points, what seems to be an uncertain sense of direction.\n",
        "A sprightly little entertainment that should enthrall tots without straining the patience of their parents.\n",
        "[A] delightful remake.\n",
        "Totally uncorrupting.\n",
        "This film is clever even with its human actors, dispensing with the first film's animal-loving hermits and playing up the importance of a cute, newly typical American family.\n",
        "Even the most televisionally overstimulated will likely enjoy this boy-and-his-dog movie -- which also happens to be a girl-and-her-cat movie too.\n",
        "It has a certain craftsmanship and an undeniable charm, and if you find yourself watching it with a child you may end up liking it almost as much.\n",
        "Matters are accomplished by director Duwayne Dunham with fairly professional skill.\n",
        "As an episode of The Wonderful World of Disney, it would be fine, but as a major motion picture, it's disappointing.\n",
        "having suffered with my human through the dim-witted Beethoven and the dreadful Bingo, I found Homeward Bound to be a breath of animal-oriented realism, voice-overs or no.\n",
        "We've seen it a million times.\n",
        "Disney's tried-and-true slapstick material (est. 1959) is here given a heinously unimaginative interpretation by five screenwriters and a director who manages to squander the gifts of an absurdly overqualified supporting cast.\n",
        "The unruly pack of subplots make The Shaggy Dog much more convoluted than it needs to be.\n",
        "The Shaggy Dog may not make you howl, but it does offer a few bona fide belly laughs, which is more than the last few Tim Allen movies could boast.\n",
        "This is a classic family fun fare, likely destined for sequelhood.\n",
        "Director Brian Robbins keeps the special effects and animatronics to a minimum, relying more often than not on real (albeit trained) dogs. That extra bit of authenticity is refreshing.\n",
        "The Shaggy Dog is as good as family entertainment gets, meaning it will tickle kids while throwing the occasional bone to parents to keep them from growling.\n",
        "This is a Dog with heart.\n",
        "If, in the end, this Allen film is an old dog that can't learn any new tricks, it's still enough of a safe, bland entertainment to keep some undiscriminating parents happy.\n",
        "To paraphrase the over used song employed in Disney's latest dismal recycling of The Shaggy Dog -- who let this dog out?\n",
        "Watching a pack of dogs sniff Tim Allen's butt -- repeatedly -- is probably someone's idea of a good time at the movies. Not mine.\n",
        "This is precisely the type of moviegoing experience engineered for those who still get a laugh when the Baha Men hit Who Let the Dogs Out? accompanies a doggie mayhem montage.\n",
        "Shaggy Dog is a subpar remake of a subpar movie that can only spawn subpar remakes.\n",
        "The Shaggy Dog is just what it wants to be -- wholesome, slapstick, family fun with nice animal rights and 'don't mess with mother nature' messages running beneath the surface.\n",
        "More assembled than groomed, The Shaggy Dog should do enough tricks and act cute enough to amuse an audience that wants only to have its belly tickled.\n",
        "No one's going to argue with a movie that underscores the importance of paying attention to kids, but for me at least, the sight of [Tim] Allen running around on all fours failed to unleash howls of laughter.\n",
        "It's a typical hit picture remake, which is never a good sign.\n",
        "The Shaggy Dog is a well-dispositioned but forgettable mutt without any new tricks.\n",
        "It's a pleasant surprise to find a movie that genuinely pitches itself at a child's level while also giving parents some real laughs.\n",
        "The Swiss Family Robinson, like most of Walt Disney's screen versions of the children's classics, is good Disney and bad culture.\n",
        "It's hard to imagine how the picture could be better as a rousing, humorous and gentle-hearted tale of family love amid primitive isolation and dangers.\n",
        "The script trips all over itself to be hip and flip before it takes a desperate dip into utter conventionality: dull car chases, explosions, inept slapstick.\n",
        "Walt Disney's production of 20000 Leagues under the Sea is very special kind of picture, combining photographic ingenuity, imaginative story telling and fiscal daring.\n",
        "Grandly entertaining.\n",
        "This is one of the great movie adventures, fully deserving its canonisation in Disney World.\n",
        "As fabulous and fantastic as anything he has ever done in cartoons is Walt Disney's 'live action' movie made from Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\n",
        "The talky 20,000 Leagues probably won't thrill kids fresh from The Matrix, but they may be interested to know that the Verne film was the effects marvel of its day.\n",
        "The offbeat, fact-based saga is enlivened by the perfect balance of humor, emotion and insight and should be one of the true sleepers among fall box office releases.\n",
        "Travelogue shots of happy Jamaicans dancing in the sun give way to patronising comedy.\n",
        "A cute, buoyant sports fantasy, jolted along by a reggae soundtrack and playfully acted by an appealing cast.\n",
        "Entirely mediocre and forgettable\n",
        "The ghost of Stepin Fetchit is hovering in the tropical ether.\n",
        "If you like underdog movies, you might like this one. Especially if you haven't seen very many.\n",
        "A wholesome, engaging, frequently hilarious, ultimately inspirational film.\n",
        "Cinderella is beguiling proof that Walt Disney still knows his way around fairyland.\n",
        "The musical numbers woven into the fantasy are generally solid, with at least two or three likely hit tunes standing out in the half-dozen songs.\n",
        "This 1950 effort shows Disney at the tail end of his best period, when his backgrounds were still luminous with depth and detail and his incidental characters still had range and bite.\n",
        "Considering the army of craftsmen who work on a Disney cartoon film, it is hard to give individual credits, for the memorable qualities.\n",
        "As usual, everything is slightly glossy, soppy and hearty, yet not a string is left untwanged.\n",
        "When those little mice bust a gut trying to drag that key up hundreds of stairs in order to free Cinderella, I don't care how many Kubrick pictures you've seen, it's still exciting.\n",
        "That rare event, a Disney failure.\n",
        "It's a gay, colorful, resplendent conceit.\n",
        "A brilliant hodgepodge of Mr. Disney's illustrative art-a literal spinwheel of image, color and music which tumbles at you with explosive surprise.\n",
        "No other Disney feature achieved this level of exuberant abstraction, or displayed the same sheer pleasure in the magic of the animator's art.\n",
        "There is still some life in the characterizations, though the animation is turning stiff and flat.\n",
        "The feature-length cartoon demonstrates anew the magic of the Disney animators and imagination in character creation.\n",
        "A beautifully animated Disney feature.\n",
        "The humor sparkles with real, knowing sophistication -- meaning for all ages -- and some of the characters on the fifth-century landscape of Old England are Disney pips.\n",
        "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an entertainment without a particular point of view.\n",
        "While the makers of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves may have set out to bury the poor old duffer of Sherwood Forest in a welter of trendy banter, they have ended up burying themselves as well.\n",
        "Much as I admire Costner, it is the very qualities of honesty, honor and sincerity he projects so forcefully that encumber this Robin.\n",
        "Its ostensibly canny match of star and subject assures that Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves will fill theaters. But will it send moviegoers out enthralled? The message from this cracked crystal ball is: Naaah.\n",
        "There's no subtlety in this Robin Hood, but subtlety isn't everything: Grit and obviousness have coarser charms, and the director makes much of these.\n",
        "The fight sequences are explosive, the physical production is impressive, and the supporting performances are full of juice.\n",
        "No longer a study in swashbuckling bravura, it is a depressive political allegory in which wit is as rare as a ray of sun in the gray British sky.\n",
        "As a piece of escapism, this deluxe, action-heavy, 2-hour-and-21-minute Robin Hood gets the job done.\n",
        "The best that can be said for Costner's performance is that it is pleasant. At worst, it can be argued whether it is more properly described as wooden or cardboard.\n",
        "The mix of comedy, '90s sensibility, and swashbuckling action is more hit than miss, even if the overall effect is rather slapdash.\n",
        "Mr. Costner and his associates seem to have approached their subject without a clear idea about the kind of movie they wanted to make.\n",
        "Fair damsels and noble sirs, you must free yourselves of these wearisome observations. This is a state-of-the-art retelling of a classic.\n",
        "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves has pomp and scale; what it lacks is something essential -- a sense of \"Once Upon a Time\" wonder, the exultant, heady thrill of legend.\n",
        "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is a murky, unfocused, violent and depressing version of the classic story, with little of the lightheartedness and romance we expect from Robin Hood.\n",
        "The sets are luxuriant, the songs lilting, the scenario witty but impeccably sentimental, and the supporting cast only a pinfeather short of perfection.\n",
        "The grace of the effects makes it some kind of classic.\n",
        "Julie Andrews' first appearance on the screen is a signal triumph and she performs as easily as she sings, displaying a fresh type of beauty nicely adaptable to the color cameras.\n",
        "Compared to even 'sophisticated' juvenile fodder, the sheer exuberance of Disney's adaptation of PL Travers' children's classic should tickle the most jaded fancy.\n",
        "Although Dumbo offers no startling innovations in animated cartooning, it is probably Disney's best all-round picture to date.\n",
        "It's one of Disney's most charming and perfectly proportioned films, uninflated by the cultural pretensions Uncle Walt was fond of slipping in.\n",
        "There's a pleasant little story, plenty of pathos mixed with the large doses of humor, a number of appealing new animal characters, lots of good music, and the usual Disney skillfulness in technique.\n",
        "One of the best of Disney's animated features.\n",
        "A film you will never forget.\n",
        "An enchanting and humane fable.\n",
        "The dragon itself grunts, grins and goofs around, but isn't half as appealing as its creators obviously hoped. More character and better animation would have helped.\n",
        "You don't often see children's musicals as ambitious as this one any more.\n",
        "It's more sophisticated than the usual run of Disney product, but it lacks the inventiveness that could endow it with genuine charm.\n",
        "The fantasy is earthbound, the score by Richard and Robert Sherman (who also wrote music and lyrics for Mary Poppins) is forgettable, the special effects lackadaisical.\n",
        "It is when the film [based on the book by Mary Norton] dives deeply into the realms of fantasy that it is most enjoyable.\n",
        "Must all films for kids be so shoddy, though? The music is appalling.\n",
        "I suspect the movie will be something of a long, uninterrupted sit for the very children for whom it's intended, and an even longer one for those parents and guardians (both adults and teen-age) who will probably accompany them.\n",
        "The Disney organization is worst when it makes \"family entertainment\" and best when it sticks to pure, simple, charming fantasy.\n",
        "What's really disappointing is the undistinguished animation: the film looks and plays more like the Disney shorts than the Disney features.\n",
        "Walt Disney has gone a long way towards tightening the leisurely, haphazard adventure of Alice in the wonderland of her imagination.\n",
        "If you are not too particular about the images of Carroll and Tenniel, if you are high on Disney whimsey and if you'll take a somewhat slow, uneven pace, you should find this picture entertaining.\n",
        "Against all odds, a tear or two is effectively jerked, and there was enough skill on display to encourage some hope for the new generation of Disney animators, who made their debut here.\n",
        "One of the more homely Disney animated features.\n",
        "The bottom line, I suppose, is: Will kids like this movie? And the answer is, sure, I think so.\n",
        "This is a pretty, relentlessly cheery, old-fashioned sort of Disney cartoon feature, chock-full of bouncy songs of an upbeatness that is stickier than Krazy-Glue and played by animals more anthropomorphic than the humans that occasionally appear.\n",
        "There's not much edification in store, and [director] Bright cruises over some bumpy plot holes, but the teen's perspective does put a black comic spotlight on wider social hypocrisies.\n",
        "Freeway glints here and there with dark humor amounting to a knowing wink that undercuts the cautionary tale at its heart and the seriousness of its graphic sociology.\n",
        "Cynical, stylish and witty.\n",
        "Rude in the way the truth is rude -- only funnier.\n",
        "It's too drawn-out, too talky and, at the most crucial moment, needlessly implausible, to sustain its humor and large dose of violence.\n",
        "Alive with the luscious turn-ons of sex and danger, Freeway is the most impressive debut film I've seen all year.\n",
        "Both grimly funny and thought-provoking.\n",
        "Like it or hate it (or both), you have to admire its skill, and the over-the-top virtuosity of Reese Witherspoon and Kiefer Sutherland.\n",
        "In dialogue, song and story, Music still contains too much sugar, too little spice.\n",
        "Every audience sniffle and tear has been taken into account.\n",
        "Call me a drongo, but this really is quite watchable (yes, I've seen it more than once).\n",
        "The septet of blond and beaming youngsters who have to act like so many Shirley Temples and Freddie Bartholomews when they were young do as well as could be expected with their assortedly artificial roles, but the adults are fairly horrendous.\n",
        "The movie has almost everything: music, romance, kids, spectacular scenery, religion, sentiment, comedy high and low, and, at the end, intrigue and adventure.\n",
        "A warmly pulsating, captivating drama.\n",
        "Die Hard is an action picture with a capital A. In fact, you might as well go ahead and capitalize the whole darn word.\n",
        "As a grand flourish of cinematic technique, it is awesome; as a human drama, it is disgusting and silly, a mindless depiction of carnage on an epic scale.\n",
        "McTiernan, who directed last summer's Predator, composes the action cleanly and logically, making good use of Jackson DeGovia's elaborate post-modernist set-the building becomes something of a character in itself.\n",
        "In the first half of Director John McTiernan's movie, Willis wears an undershirt. In the second half he gets rid of it. And that's pretty much it for his performance.\n",
        "Die Hard is as high tech, rock hard and souped up as an action film can be.\n",
        "A serviceable if rather overextended and overblown adventure thriller.\n",
        "A hi-tech thriller with a human heart.\n",
        "The scenes move with such relentless energy and smashing special-effects extravagance that Die Hard turns out to be everything action-genre fans, and Bruce Willis's relieved investors, might have hoped for.\n",
        "For what it is, this is the top model -- flash, bang, and witty one-liners all included.\n",
        "It's good, dumb fun.\n",
        "It gets your heart pounding, then makes you hate yourself for it.\n",
        "Inappropriate and wrongheaded interruptions reveal the fragile nature of the plot and prevent it from working.\n",
        "The Lawnmower Man echoes Frankenstein and a zillion other noble-scientist-whose-experiment-goes-awry movies.\n",
        "The Lawnmower Man has it all -- melodramatic plot, bad acting, special effects that will undoubtedly seem cheesy in about five minutes and even a concluding sequence in which the usual lofty moral is voiced.\n",
        "Dazzling computer animation and special effects overcome The Lawnmower Man's mundane story.\n",
        "Despite the hackneyed sub-Frankenstein plot, the dazzling computer-generated special effects almost carry the film.\n",
        "The Lawnmower Man depends mostly on a lot of colorful video-game-like special effects. They are very loud but, after a while, the noise and the lights induce a torpor that is quite soothing.\n",
        "So loosely based on a Stephen King short story as to constitute fraud, The Lawnmower Man goes right to the bottom of a growing list of failed King adaptations.\n",
        "Nick Cassavetes' first feature celebrates the acting grandeur of his mom Gena Rowlands, casting her in the lead role as a older woman who would rather stick to her independent lifestyle than be dependent on her kids; I wish the script were better.\n",
        "The movie is likable and sympathetic but probably too muted to compel much damn-the -torpedoing to the multiplex.\n",
        "One of the weirdest movies Alfred Hitchcock ever made.\n",
        "Leigh's best work yet is indisputably screen art, but it's a flesh-and-blood 'people' movie, too.\n",
        "Though Hanks keeps the satirical and critical aspects of this look at show biz fairly light, there's a lot of conviction and savvy behind the steadiness of his gaze.\n",
        "First-time writer/director Tom Hanks stays about a half-beat ahead of the cliches with rim shots of boyish enthusiasm and deft comedy. The movie's also buoyed by the title song, whose Beatles sound is infectious enough to merit a real hit.\n",
        "A sweet, likeable tale of the quick rise to fame and then demise of a small town band. Set in 1964, Hanks' film offers a sanitized, Gump-ish look at a mythical period when boys were boys and girls were girls, with no references to the sex-drug subculture\n",
        "Sweet nothing, then, but what would you expect of a rock movie devoted to the drummer?\n",
        "Mr. Hanks's debut feature, written and directed with delightful good cheer, is rock-and-roll nostalgia presented as pure fizz.\n",
        "Though Hanks doesn't serve up much context, he's solid with details, and the Wonders' performances ring truer than most.\n",
        "...a brightly entertaining blend of humor and heartbreak about four fresh-faced guys in a band from Erie, Pa.\n",
        "Leaving audiences feeling good is very much, and very successfully, on its mind.\n",
        "...a movie that, like many a pop tune, has a cute idea but a simpleminded lyric.\n",
        "Without hauling in a lot of deep meanings, it remembers with great warmth a time and a place.\n",
        "...a larky but observant comedy.\n",
        "Hanks has good \"Thing\" going.\n",
        "Hanks evokes astonishingly precise memories of the time.\n",
        "In the end, the movie simply clicks. It is a class act all the way.\n",
        "It's a pleasant little film with a big profile, thanks to Tom Hanks, who wrote and directed and gave himself a plum role as the band's hard-nosed manager.\n",
        "That Thing You Do! is a credible first effort.\n",
        "A bargian basement Ghost, a hybrid of the earnest nature of an inspirational play and the sleek calculation of a Lifetime TV movie.\n",
        "The film is cursed with clumsy staginess, exposing its roots as a play.\n",
        "...a stunning debut by Natascha McElhone...\n",
        "Because the film is so effective for its first two-thirds and because it has its heart in the right place throughout, audiences may be willing to forgive its final third.\n",
        "If Beautiful Thing were any more sensitive, it would faint.\n",
        "Reminds me of some of Jonathan Demme's early movies, where ordinary people are celebrated for their eccentricities but not condescended to.\n",
        "Represents a keen, personal look at the difficulties of growing up gay in a heterosexual world.\n",
        "Beautiful Thing isn't particularly deep, nor is it a great piece of filmmaking, but it's so sweet-natured and well-acted that it's hard to resist.\n",
        "The boys' lives contain few surprises ... but from the other characters there is one astonishment after another.\n",
        "In portraying romance, the film transcends its homosexual themes, while at the same time celebrating them.\n",
        "Frankly, if I had to see either Harlin-Davis movie again, I'd opt for the klutzy unpleasantness of Cutthroat Island over the efficient if equally stupid unpleasantness of this 1996 release.\n",
        "The Long Kiss Goodnight is the fall's best summer movie.\n",
        "Like the heroine, the movie has two personalities that smartly coexist.\n",
        "There's an excessive amount of excess -- a mind-numbing plurality of firearm battles, vehicular explosions and brutally frank sexual talk.\n",
        "\"The Long Kiss Goodnight\" has a jokey good time with its outlandish pyrotechnics and offbeat character interplay.\n",
        "The only saving graces are Davis's stripped-down, mean-as-a-wildcat portrayal of the Uzi-toting Charly, and Jackson's engagingly ineffectual turn.\n",
        "Mr. Black's screenplay is mean-spirited, but it earns its keep with sharp, sarcastic dialogue and ingenious ways of setting up this story.\n",
        "With square-jawed grimaces and big guns, Geena Davis could be a convincing two-fisted bullet-spraying action hero -- if only she had a convincing movie in which to be one.\n",
        "Here's the supersexy and action-charged Hollywood take on France's La Femme Nikita that Bridget Fonda couldn't pull off in her Girl Scoutish Point of No Return.\n",
        "[A] quip-filled but mean-spirited slugfest.\n",
        "When the smoke finally clears for the final credits, we may have had a tolerably good time, but there's no lingering satisfaction.\n",
        "Is somebody kidding here? Given the movie's dialogue, the answer is probably yes, but jocular one-liners really grate on the ear amid wall-to-wall nastiness.\n",
        "I liked it in the same way I might like an arcade game: It holds your attention until you run out of quarters, and then you wander away without giving it another thought.\n",
        "Harlin and Davis don't seem to realize that the results aren't refreshingly revisionist - they're eye-avertingly embarrassing.\n",
        "The picture is too lightweight, too posturing and too self-important to go in an introspective direction.\n",
        "Ranges in quality from adolescent boys' adventure stories to Heart of Darkness.\n",
        "When the movie sticks to fact, the result is a hypnotic spectacle.\n",
        "Can't transcend a too-familiar script.\n",
        "The camerawork is frenetic and confusing, and the big confrontations are as likely to provoke unintentional laughter as edge-of-the-seat excitement.\n",
        "Despite mumbo jumbo about the lions being supernatural demons unleashed by the imperialistic white man, it's nothing more than Jaws with claws.\n",
        "It lacks even the usual charm of being so bad it's funny. It's just bad.\n",
        "This runs 118 minutes, but it felt like six or seven hours.\n",
        "High-spirited and infectiously energetic.\n",
        "Pacino's first film as writer/director is a marvellously intelligent, witty and imaginative exploration of the problems faced by anyone wishing to act in Shakespeare or translate the plays to film.\n",
        "There are actors' rehearsals and performances, and Mr. Pacino interviews experts, conducts man-on-the-street polls and stages collegial arguments with his cronies. Thus emerges the intricate story of Richard's ambition.\n",
        "The last half-hour drags.\n",
        "An astute, funny, loving and occasionally even beautiful documentary about actors preparing to do a play.\n",
        "Pacino makes looking for Richard a great adventure and outrageous fun.\n",
        "While there's no harm in attempting to make Shakespeare more accessible, it's hard to imagine this film exciting anyone except Pacino's fans and those who are fatally charmed by celebrity actors.\n",
        "Having chosen to be actors, they know they cannot respect their craft without embracing its greatest writer. Having chosen to be readers and viewers, we cannot do less, and this film is a delightful inspiration.\n",
        "It's ironic that the movie is done in by what you'd expect to be the high point: the performance segments that dominate the final third.\n",
        "Looking for Richard is unlike any previous adaptation of the Bard's work, and that's reason enough to give it a shot.\n",
        "It's a simple, appealing premise and filmmaker Spike Lee uses it to full comic advantage.\n",
        "A vital regeneration of a filmmaker's talent as well as a bracing and often very funny dramatization of urgent sociopolitical themes...\n",
        "Though Lee's deft expertise keeps things pacy and (mostly) plausible, the material can't avoid a certain predictability and, in the end, a preachy sentimentality.\n",
        "While the film assembles a full array of black male stereotypes and conines them to what is essentially a talky one-set play, Mr. Lee stylistically jump-starts this small, earnest film in every way he can.\n",
        "It's two hours of men sitting on a bus talking, but the talk is alive. Lee keeps the scenes short, so that nothing ever resolves completely.\n",
        "It's successful at holding our interest -- at making us care, and believe.\n",
        "An involving, intimate portrait of a group of men gathered for a common purpose.\n",
        "If the movie finally doesn't know when to quit, its flaws are those of enthusiasm and heart.\n",
        "If the movie's central sadness is that we identify with our own group and suspect outsiders, the movie's message is that we have been given brains to learn to empathize.\n",
        "Bland, interminable chase scenes take up so much of the story -- the hackneyed plot doesn't need much exposition -- that the sheer repetitiveness begins to amaze you.\n",
        "Sadly, Sheen doesn't even look profound. Like a zombie who's spent too much time in the gym, he blunders heavily from one stunt to the next, his pursed lips conveying nothing more than pique.\n",
        "The climactic assassination attempt... is so ridiculous there's only one real danger: that the president (and the audience) will laugh to death.\n",
        "The film is so contemptuous of its audience it doesn't even bother to present a surface resemblance to reality.\n",
        "When Charlie Sheen and Donald Sutherland appear in any movie, you should be wary. Their contracts seem to demand nothing but corny formula.\n",
        "There isn't a brain in its empty little head, or in its assembly-line story, which is about how Charlie Sheen pauses occasionally between ludicrous action scenes, some of them ripped off from better films.\n",
        "The plot, as it eventually unfolds, is so absurd and leads to such a silly climax that much of the audience's good will is burned away.\n",
        "Here, we have stereotyped villains involved in a generic, high- level conspiracy, and a couple of equally-bland heroes on the run.\n",
        "Some political junkies have an inordinate yen for movies that hop-skip around familiar Washington, D.C., locales and inside the bowels of a sinister White House. Members of this club may get some ephemeral amusement out of Shadow Conspiracy.\n",
        "It's worth seeing Jude, a stark adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure, just for the extraordinary performance of Christopher Eccleston as Jude Fawley.\n",
        "Young English actress Kate Winslet adds luster and energy to Jude, a bold and generally successful attempt to adapt Thomas Hardy's final novel, Jude the Obscure, to the bigscreen.\n",
        "Without the benefit of Hardy's prose, the point of the movie is lost in the grim, grayish ether.\n",
        "Ambitious, sensitive, but ultimately uninvolving.\n",
        "Jude remains a handsome if gravely flawed film.\n",
        "The dark, steel engraving look that cinematographer Eduardo Serra has given Jude endows it with a somber magnificence.\n",
        "Jude is knockout Hardy, filled with stormy visual poetry and accompanied by a gorgeous yet simple score.\n",
        "The problem here isn't grimness but a failure to make grimness wrench the heart.\n",
        "Winterbottom is angry, clear-headed, and with a sure visual sense.\n",
        "This is a film of tremendous scope and emotional depth that uncovers the soul of a novel and brings it to life on the screen.\n",
        "Watching the wan Christopher Eccleston as Jude and Kate Winslet as his cousin and lover Sue Bridehead, an audience might well wonder what all the fuss was about.\n",
        "A charming, sweet-natured divertissement.\n",
        "Listening to the others sounding like a spouse in the shower makes one wonder: How bad could Barrymore be that she had to be dubbed?\n",
        "Much of the film's story is half-hearted, its jokes hit or miss, and what starts out feeling genial ends up unavoidably thin.\n",
        "If it doesn't quite mandate a viewer song burst, this sweet conceit ought to glue a grin on your face until its crucial next-to-last scene hits a clunker note.\n",
        "For a picture that's almost a complete misfire, it's painless to sit through.\n",
        "It's a world of both serene privilege and surreal possibility, and it offers a delightful and witty compendium of the film maker's favorite things.\n",
        "It would take a heart of stone to resist this movie.\n",
        "It's difficult not to be impressed by what Allen has achieved with this film: successfully reviving the musical comedy in such a thoroughly delightful fashion.\n",
        "Styled as a romantic confection, Everyone Says I Love You is, in fact, steeped in an unacknowledged middle-aged sadness that leaks from the writer-director and saps the energies of his cast.\n",
        "Four guys hang out, kid one another, get into scuffles and flash their gonadal searchlight for available women. Yikes, haven't there been enough variations on the multiple-buddy movie? Actually, no.\n",
        "A winningly confident snapshot of the nightlives of a bunch of young showbiz wannabes in a very upto-the-minute Hollywood.\n",
        "Ninety minutes spent learning how not to pick up girls. This is what the movies were made for, isn't it?\n",
        "Mr. Favreau wrote this screenplay with his real friends in mind. And the cast's camaraderie is appealingly clear.\n",
        "A guy film that gives you something to latch onto, that makes male bonding both believable and appealing.\n",
        "It's no masterpiece, but it's real.\n",
        "The movie is sweet, funny, observant and goofy with a small \"g,\" which means you don't get paid, but at least you don't have to wear the suit.\n",
        "Swingers is uneven, amateurish and borderline misogynistic. But it's also very funny, and it never loses its cool.\n",
        "This kind of story -- a staple of low-budget features -- is getting awfully stale, and the injection of humor can't completely invigorate the proceedings.\n",
        "It is all legally preposterous. But Levinson is a slick craftsman, his actors are insinuatingly real, and cinematographer Michael Ballhaus casts a disarmingly believable light on these proceedings.\n",
        "If audiences aren't bothered by this disturbing subtext, there's a lot to enjoy in this impeccably structured, handsomely produced saga.\n",
        "Levinson has done nothing to sift the half-truths from the melodrama...\n",
        "At times the images are agonizing to behold, men in their most desperate, hateful depths preying on children. The film, exceptional on many counts, ultimately is sad in a hopeless, haunting way.\n",
        "Idealized? You bet. That's why the loss of this world must be avenged with the same broad strokes that you'd expect from the Count of Monte Cristo.\n",
        "In craft terms alone, Sleepers is considerably better than average filmmaking, but it's difficult to take this film as seriously as it takes itself.\n",
        "As entertainment, the movie functions successfully. But I don't believe the story is true -- not true to the facts, and not true to the morality it pretends to be about.\n",
        "Despite protests from the Catholic Church (which whines about any movie that portrays priests as anything less-than-pure), Sleepers, which represents two and one-half hours of gripping entertainment, is well worth the price of admission.\n",
        "Engrosses if it doesn't fully convince.\n",
        "Not surprisingly, Ford has most of the action here. But Connery -- in what is often a test of a true actor -- shows how much you can do with an essentially passive part.\n",
        "Fans of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas' Indiana Jones series may rest assured that the latest installment, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, is fully up to, as well as virtually indistinguishable from, its predecessors.\n",
        "Though Last Crusade lacks the novelty of Raiders (and, by the way, the flat-out breathless pacing of Temple of Doom), it's an entertaining capper to the trilogy.\n",
        "This is not so much a bad film as a machine-like one lacking the same energy as the original, which it most resembles.\n",
        "Even if he's considerably more battered than his nearest competitor, Indiana quits at the top of the heap. It's just that the heap isn't what it was eight years ago. It's been almost flattered to death.\n",
        "Captures some of the sense of fun that infused the first movie while using the addition of Sean Connery to up the comedic ante and provide a father/son dynamic.\n",
        "What was conceived as a child's dream of a Saturday matinee serial has evolved into a moving excursion into religious myth.\n",
        "The fast pace and force-fed wisecracks are as seamless as ever, but rarely has audience laughter sounded as hollow.\n",
        "Jeffrey Boam's script dabbles with themes of neglect and reconciliation, but there's nothing ponderous about the duo's near death scrapes and light-hearted tussels over the same blonde Fraulein.\n",
        "Of the three Jones films, The Last Crusade may well become the sentimental favorite, the Indiana to end them all.\n",
        "You want Adventure? Thrills? How about Rats?\n",
        "The final section, in which Indy must claim the Grail and save his father's life, is imbued with a turgid, pop-mystical tone.\n",
        "As I watched it, I felt a real delight, because recent Hollywood escapist movies have become too jaded and cynical, and they have lost the feeling that you can stumble over astounding adventures just by going on a hike with your Scout troop.\n",
        "Offers attractive, inoffensive characters and a smattering of broad laughs, but it fails to use its potential to explore weightier themes such as John's mid-life crisis.\n",
        "Under the clunky direction of Peter Chelsom, while forced to mouth inane dialogue by Audrey Wells ... a swell bunch of troupers get mangled in a monsoon of cliches.\n",
        "There are so many appealing performers in Shall We Dance? that it's a crime the director, Peter Chelsom, and the screenwriter, Audrey Wells, haven't given them more to do.\n",
        "Occasionally charming but ultimately forgettable bit of fox-trot fluff.\n",
        "Takes a small, exquisite Japanese movie and turns it into a big, stupid American movie. Still, it must be said that as glossy and overproduced as the thing is, it's a good Big Stupid American movie.\n",
        "Turns a sweet, lilting story into a clunky, cliched and tedious movie sitcom.\n",
        "The original remains the standard, and it's a far deeper work, but this paint-by-numbers project manages to get by on its good humour and undeniably entertaining ensemble cast.\n",
        "This mildly entertaining bauble will disappear from your memory even before you've dislodged the last popcorn husks from your back teeth.\n",
        "Where the original soared, the new version hugs the ground. It's like the difference between Fred Astaire's dancing and Richard Gere's.\n",
        "Miscast, misguided and woefully misbegotten, this clumsy American remake of the deftly delicate 1996 sleeper hit from Japan is too blah to bludgeon.\n",
        "The central idea -- that losing yourself in a small, private world can help you to better engage the larger world -- isn't lost in translation.\n",
        "A pleasant, uncomplicated, adult night out -- an event nearly as rare as a new romantic Hollywood musical.\n",
        "There isn't even any exciting dancing here, and what hoofing there is has been heavily edited, usually with the dancers' feet cropped off.\n",
        "A comedy with two left feet.\n",
        "A sleek Hollywood crowd-pleaser, more movie than art film, but its makers have wisely stuck not only to the spirit but often even to the letter of the original.\n",
        "A funny, well-acted adult tale about the difficulty of holding onto happiness.\n",
        "Sayonara sushi, hello turkey.\n",
        "Invigorating, hopeful, funny and perfectly consciously corny at times.\n",
        "Asks us to return to the days of yesteryear, when we would accept Cary Grant as a country bumpkin and Marilyn Monroe as an ugly duckling. These days, that's asking too much.\n",
        "Waltzes us into a world where interesting emotional realities give way to stock responses.\n",
        "Astaire and his vet terp aide, Hermes Pan, have devised four corking dance routines which director George Stevens has expertly envisioned and mounted.\n",
        "Nicely directed but a bit on the twee side with its Wodehouse plot and mock Englishisms, the result would be questionable but for a rich Gershwin score.\n",
        "Burns and Allen were imported to balance her lack of humor; their presence is certainly welcome, and their work with Astaire is surprisingly effective.\n",
        "Producer Dore Schary, in association with Adrian Scott, has pulled no punches.\n",
        "While the film remains a respectable thriller, only Ryan's crafty, quietly deranged performance lifts it out of the ordinary.\n",
        "This ultra-low-budget thriller did what all great B movies do: it broached a subject that 'respectable' movies wouldn't touch.\n",
        "A thematically articulate film.\n",
        "Sternberg's personality survives; what's missing is the soul that might have turned the artifice and self-parody into poetry.\n",
        "What is so enjoyable, apart from Harry Wild's shimmering camerawork, is the tongue-in-cheek tone of the script and performances, best evidenced in the sparkling banter and innuendo between Mitchum and Russell.\n",
        "All the other ingredients, including Miss Russell's famed physique, are pretty much the same as have been tumbled into previous cheesecakes with Jane and Bob.\n",
        "Great fun, with Wilder for once giving an impeccably controlled performance as the factory's bizarre owner.\n",
        "If the picture is journeyman James, it is also pitapatational entertainment, the most sophisticated scare show since Diabolique.\n",
        "Based on Henry James' story Turn of the Screw this catches an eerie, spine-chilling mood right at the start and never lets up on its grim, evil theme.\n",
        "Too much Freud and too little thought.\n",
        "Is it the finest, smartest, most visually savvy horror film ever made by a big studio?\n",
        "Jack Clayton's 1961 chiller lives up to the story's title, incrementally tightening the nerves through suggestive technical artistry in a way that few contemporary ghost stories manage.\n",
        "Sends some formidable chills down the spine.\n",
        "These days, comedy beggars can't be choosers. Woody Allen is about all we've got. And Woody, please stay healthy.\n",
        "As a stand-up routine it's a scream.\n",
        "Plenty of one-liners, and it has the best banana-skin joke in film history.\n",
        "The film is loaded with throwaway literacy and broad slapstick, and while it fumbles the end, the parade of verbal and visual amusement is pleasant as long as it lasts.\n",
        "Sleeper is the closest Allen has come to classic slapstick-and-chase comedy, and he's good at it.\n",
        "Sleeper is terrific.\n",
        "It is a funny picture - not too consistently, and certainly not too coherently, but when it hits, it hits.\n",
        "Bananas is chockfull of sight gags, one-liners and swiftly executed unnecessary excursions into vulgarity whose humor for the most part can't make up for content.\n",
        "Wonderfully incoherent.\n",
        "Allen's view of the world is fraught with everything except pathos, and it's a view I happen to find very funny.\n",
        "Perhaps the most unusual aspect of what is surely the year's most original and daring comedy is that John Cleese is not the funniest performer in it. Believe it or not, that honor goes to none other than the usually somber Kevin Kline.\n",
        "Somehow, the movie manages to do the impossible: It makes John Cleese less than hilarious.\n",
        "Low comedy at high speed, it pretends to be a caper movie about a smooth London jewel heist and its infinitely complex aftermath. Actually, it's a smart farce about ingrained cultural differences.\n",
        "The movie's basic joke holds that the overbearing, unselfconscious Americans will do anything and say anything (and usually as loudly as possible), while the timorous British are nearly too polite to breathe.\n",
        "Wanda defies gravity, in both senses of the word, and redefines a great comic tradition.\n",
        "Like many of the best English comedies, much of the humor here is based on character, good-natured high spirits, and fairly uninhibited vulgarity.\n",
        "Though it is less tasteless, irreverent and satirical than the Python pics, film still is wacky and occasionally outrageous in its own, distinctly British way.\n",
        "There's nothing deep, nothing ground-breaking, but it's a never-dull, tightly scripted yarn with some very funny gags.\n",
        "It's not easy to describe the movie's accumulating dimness or to understand what went wrong.\n",
        "It'll keep you amused enough to sit still and even remember it fondly. But it seems a light day's fishing for Messers Cleese and Palin.\n",
        "It's a deliciously dishy comedy, but like sushi an acquired taste.\n",
        "The funniest movie I have seen in a long time.\n",
        "When it comes to comedians, everyone has their favorite. Mine is John Cleese.\n",
        "I've always considered it the group's nadir; it seems toothlessly silly.\n",
        "Just as wacky and imaginative as their earlier film outings.\n",
        "Python successfully lampoon religious attitudes rather than religion itself.\n",
        "Bad taste of this order is rare but not yet dead.\n",
        "The Pythons are enlightened jesters, whose scorn is reserved for those who persist in walking in darkness.\n",
        "Funny, in that peculiar British way where jokes are told sideways, with the obvious point and then the delayed zinger.\n",
        "Still holds up beautifully, as both pointed satire and silly, stakes-free comedy.\n",
        "I can't say Life of Brian stands as a comic masterpiece, but it's an indelible part of impolite cinema history, and some of its asides remain priceless.\n",
        "A king-size cult comedy hit.\n",
        "Still has its rude, rowdy sting -- and it still speaks more truth about religion than nearly all serious movies on the subject.\n",
        "The greatest work of religious skepticism ever put on the screen.\n",
        "The more things change, the more we have to laugh if we are to have a prayer of remaining sane, and the Pythons are the best possible step in that direction.\n",
        "After all these years, the pungency of this satire about the perils of mass miscommunication hasn't dissipated.\n",
        "It's a hearty burlesque.\n",
        "There is little doubt that The Life of Brian represents some of the most daring and cutting edge comedy of the 1970s.\n",
        "Victor/Victoria is a sparkling, ultra-sophisticated entertainment from Blake Edwards.\n",
        "Don't miss this one. It sends sparks.\n",
        "Not only a funny movie, but, unexpectedly, a warm and friendly one.\n",
        "Victor/Victoria is so good, so exhilarating, that the only depressing thing about it is the suspicion that Mr. Edwards is going to have a terrible time trying to top it.\n",
        "Blake Edwards's 1982 sex comedy has the most beautiful range of tones of any American film of its period: it is a work of dry wit, high slapstick, black despair, romantic warmth, and penetrating intelligence.\n",
        "powerful experience, alternately corrosive with dark parodic humor, suspenseful, moving, and terrifying.\n",
        "Every once in a rare while a film comes along that works in all departments, with story, production and performance so well blended that the end effect is one of nearly complete satisfaction. Such is The Manchurian Candidate.\n",
        "A masterpiece.\n",
        "The Manchurian Candidate pops up with a rash supposition that could serve to scare some viewers half to death -- that is, if they should be dupes enough to believe it, which we solemnly trust they won't.\n",
        "Has an excoriating, destabilizing wit that seems as knowingly sophisticated today as it must have then.\n",
        "Not a moment of The Manchurian Candidate lacks edge and tension and a cynical spin.\n",
        "Its story of Cold War intrigue, murky East-West dealings, assassination, brainwashing -- and the idea of a glorified cue-card reader playing president -- resonates today like never before.\n",
        "Lemmon plays it dirty throughout and for huge effect. Curtis underplays for equally comic effect. Wood comes through on a par with the two male stars.\n",
        "It's highly inventive, self-conscious camp, made in 1965, well before the genre wore itself out in superciliousness.\n",
        "Bonnie and Clyde don't really know that killing kills. The film does -- unlike the run of movies about violence now, which mostly know that killing sells.\n",
        "Bonnie and Clyde is the most excitingly American American movie since The Manchurian Candidate. The audience is alive to it.\n",
        "Considered New Hollywood's moment of arrival, tipping square critic Bosley Crowther into retirement (The New York Times, they were a-changin').\n",
        "Like Bonnie and Clyde themselves, the film rides off in all directions and ends up full of holes.\n",
        "It's by far the least controlled of Penn's films... but the pieces work wonderfully well, propelled by what was then a very original acting style.\n",
        "This inconsistency of direction is the most obvious fault of Bonnie and Clyde, which has some good ingredients, although they are not meshed together well.\n",
        "With its weird landscape of dusty, derelict towns and verdant highways, stunningly shot by Burnett Guffey in muted tones of green and gold, it has the true quality of folk legend.\n",
        "It is a cheap piece of bald-faced slapstick comedy that treats the hideous depredations of that sleazy, moronic pair as though they were as full of fun and frolic as the jazz-age cutups in Thoroughly Modern Millie.\n",
        "It should readily be apparent that there is something special about the production, with its brash, vivid style, indelible performances by movie icons, and bold mixture of violence and comedy, romance and tragedy.\n",
        "When I saw it, I had been a film critic for less than six months, and it was the first masterpiece I had seen on the job. I felt an exhilaration beyond describing.\n",
        "The fun of Dial M lies in its duel of wits...\n",
        "Dial M is less a filmed play than a highly cinematic investigation of theatricality.\n",
        "Dial M remains more of a filmed play than a motion picture, unfortunately revealed as a conversation piece about murder which talks up much more suspense than it actually delivers.\n",
        "The screenplay tends to constrain rather than liberate Hitchcock's thematic thrust, but there is much of technical value in his geometric survey of the scene and the elaborate strategies employed to transfer audience sympathy among the main characters.\n",
        "It all moves along in a rather efficient if lifeless fashion, with only John Williams shining as a canny police detective.\n",
        "[Hitchcock] tried once before, in Rope, to build up a whole continuous drama in one set. He wasn't as successful in that venture. Dial M has all the space it needs.\n",
        "Was by far the most visually compelling of studio stereoscopic movies.\n",
        "The dancing here brings out the sensual dreaminess of the songs. Dirty Dancing -- what a great title! -- is such a bubbleheaded, retro vision of growing up in the sixties (or any other time) that you go out of the theatre giggling happily.\n",
        "If the ending of Eleanor Bergstein's script is too neat and inspirational, the rough energy of the film's song and dance does carry one along, past the whispered doubts of better judgment.\n",
        "Although the plot is sometimes implausible, the movie's music, dancing and romantic spirit carry a lot of it. In addition, Dirty Dancing has the virtues of a female main character (a bit unusual in a coming-of-age movie) and an interesting setting.\n",
        "Smart and funny, touching and unabashedly sensual.\n",
        "This is a shapely film, considered and concise. And if its rhetorical slickness eventually covers up its emotional core, that slickness has a pleasure of its own.\n",
        "While the music on the soundtrack is predictably overloud, the period detail is refreshingly soft-pedaled.\n",
        "The dance finale between Gray and Swayze, although an obvious crowd-pleaser, is performed to a contemporary song clearly intended for the charts, which blows the period feel right off the dance floor.\n",
        "Good production values, some nice dance sequences and a likable performance by Grey make the film more than watchable.\n",
        "The film's easy charm, infectious soundtrack and tidy choreography should still win over new fans as well as old.\n",
        "Dirty Dancing works best when it's most direct and unpretentious.\n",
        "The movie plays like one long, sad, compromise; it places packaging ahead of ambition.\n",
        "The film, for all its mayhem and fury, is too distant to be truly disturbing; it treats everything with an impatient, born-too-late shrug.\n",
        "A brash, brutal crime-caper film, Reservoir Dogs has enough raw energy for 10 motion pictures and more than enough rough stuff to traumatize the sensitive. But not only does Dogs have teeth, it has brains.\n",
        "Tarantino's palpable enthusiasm, his unapologetic passion for what he's created, reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for longer than you might suspect.\n",
        "A much-acclaimed revisionist gangster film that I found to have more style than substance.\n",
        "Tarantino, in Reservoir Dogs, has made a nihilist comedy about how human nature will always undercut the best-laid plans.\n",
        "Undeniably impressive pic grabs the viewer by the lapels and shakes hard, but it also is about nothing other than a bunch of macho guys and how big their guns are.\n",
        "It's unclear whether this macho thriller does anything to improve the state of the world or our understanding of it, but it certainly sets off enough rockets to hold and shake us for every one of its 99 minutes.\n",
        "It's dynamite on a short fuse.\n",
        "You may not like the terms Tarantino sets, but you have to admit he succeeds on them.\n",
        "A tour de force.\n",
        "A small, modestly budgeted crime movie of sometimes dazzling cinematic pyrotechnics and over-the- top dramatic energy.\n",
        "Those who survive it emerge in a shell-shocked euphoria -- so good and so blunt is the writing.\n",
        "The movie feels like it's going to be terrific, but Tarantino's script doesn't have much curiosity about these guys.\n",
        "It's extremely well-acted, written with flair and directed by a 29-year-old first-timer, Quentin Tarantino, who always knows where to put the camera, when to cut to a flashback and how to draw the best work from his brilliant cast.\n",
        "The writing is crisp and clean, providing line after line of snappy dialogue designed to leave the viewer alternately pondering and laughing aloud.\n",
        "A nod to such noir crime classics as Stanley Kubrick's \"The Killing,\" the movie's more than savvy sensationalism. Suspense, horror and humor are expertly interwoven.\n",
        "It's brutal, it's funny and you won't forget it.\n",
        "There are images in Platoon so powerful that they seem, rather than simply imprinted on celluloid, to have been burned into memory.\n",
        "Precisely because Stone forces you to experience a grunt's tunnel vision and rage, Platoon is a film of inspiring empathy and awesome force. Curiously, that same tunnelvision in the end compromises Platoon.\n",
        "This is movie-making with a zealot's fervor.\n",
        "Platoon is filled with one fine performance after another, and one can only wish that every person who saw the cartoonish war fantasy that was Rambo would buy a ticket to Platoon and bear witness to something closer to the truth.\n",
        "Platoon is different. It matters.\n",
        "The artistic veneer Stone applies, along with the simpy narration provided for Sheen in the way of letters to his grandmother, detract significantly from the work's immediacy.\n",
        "For all the purported naturalism, the film seems resolutely schematic, and the attitudes shaping the drama are far from open-ended.\n",
        "Stone's eye-blistering images possess an awesome power, which sets the senses reeling and leaves the mind disturbed.\n",
        "Possibly the best work of any kind about the Vietnam War since Michael Herr's vigorous and hallucinatory book Dispatches.\n",
        "Platoon is one of those movies that, once seen, will never be forgotten, and, at least for those who were not in Vietnam, will forever alter the way in which the war is considered.\n",
        "I know that Platoon is being acclaimed for its realism, and I expect to be chastened for being a woman finding fault with a war film. But I've probably seen as much combat as most of the men saying, 'This is how war is.'\n",
        "The movie is beautifully written (by Stone), constructed with strong, clean lines, immaculately paced and regularly surprising.\n",
        "A film that says...that before you can make any vast, sweeping statements about Vietnam, you have to begin by understanding the bottom line, which is that a lot of people went over there and got killed, dead, and that is what the war meant for them.\n",
        "Platoon is like the Wall -- a dark and unforgettable memorial to the dead of Vietnam and an awesome requiem to the eternity of war.\n",
        "...it's still the standard against which all other movies about the Vietnam War are judged.\n",
        "Verhoeven does not explore the dark side, but merely exploits it, and that makes all the difference in the world.\n",
        "[The film has] a smug faith in the ability of its own speed, smartness and luxe to wow the yokels.\n",
        "Slick, clever and entertainingly overheated while you're watching it, Basic Instinct starts to evaporate the second you leave the theater.\n",
        "The harsh, politically incorrect truth about Basic Instinct is that it's a tantalizing, suspensefully correct thriller.\n",
        "Basic Instinct is a reminder of the difference between exhilaration and exhaustion, between tension and hysteria, between eroticism and exhibitionism. The line may be fine, but it is real enough to separate the great thrillers from the also-rans.\n",
        "Call me a prude, but it's not sexy watching an erotic thriller in which every time a couple does it, one of them gets it with an ice pick. I don't care how many firmly toned tummies and tushes are bared.\n",
        "A vicious, grindingly manipulative urban mystery that uses a thick atmosphere of S&M kinkiness to distract the audience from the story's thinness and inanity.\n",
        "Sharon Stone, in her first major-league role, comes on like a postfeminist Grace Kelly. She turns her haughty, slightly blank, cheerleader sexiness into something vampish and ominous -- an all-American beauty mask.\n",
        "The film's problems begin with its story, which is constructed with relentless manipulation in mind. It never plays fair with the audience.\n",
        "Despite (or maybe because of) his obligatory nods to Hitchcock, this is slick and entertaining enough to work as thriller porn, even with two contradictory denouements to its mystery.\n",
        "This erotically charged thriller about the search for an ice-pick murderer in San Francisco rivets attention through its sleek style, attractive cast doing and thinking kinky things, and story, which is as weirdly implausible as it is intensely visceral.\n",
        "Douglas and Stone are superb, and George Dzundza (as sidekick Gus) delivers another classic hard-boiled cameo.\n",
        "Basic Instinct transfers Mr. Verhoeven's flair for action-oriented material to the realm of Hitchcockian intrigue, and the results are viscerally effective even when they don't make sense.\n",
        "Verhoeven's cinematic wet dream delivers the goods, especially when Sharon Stone struts on with enough come-on carnality to singe the screen.\n",
        "A predictable, surprisingly uninvolving affair.\n",
        "These actors seem driven less by real emotions than Eveready bunny batteries.\n",
        "The film is like a crossword puzzle. It keeps your interest until you solve it. Then it's just a worthless scrap with the spaces filled in.\n",
        "The film really proves only that Jim was a bad drunk and a worse friend, and that in no way was his life exemplary.\n",
        "Kilmer is convincing in the lead role, although he never allows the viewer to share any emotions.\n",
        "The movie does a pretty good job with period ambience. But it's a long haul waiting for the hero to keel over.\n",
        "Stone sometimes loads the narrative with too much sub-Freudian baggage about Morrison's childhood, but the music, the excess and the excitement come across well.\n",
        "It is made by a Morrison groupie for other groupies, a film that leaves the rest of us locked outside wondering what the fuss is about.\n",
        "I can't recall a film that evokes the myth of the Sixties more potently.\n",
        "You get a buzz, all right, but you're left woozy and hung over, and probably won't remember much of what you've seen.\n",
        "The film is an absurdity -- muddled, self-serious, alienating, a stone drag.\n",
        "Watching the movie is like being stuck in a bar with an obnoxious drunk, when you're not drinking.\n",
        "This thriller gives you an entertaining run for your money and some offbeat frissons along the way.\n",
        "After luring us into what appears to be a classic they-gazed-at-each-other-across-an-empty-bar romantic setup, Jordan undermines our expectations so thoroughly that it's as if we've rediscovered our innocence as moviegoers.\n",
        "An astonishingly good and daring film that richly develops several intertwined thematic lines, The Crying Game takes giant risks that are stunningly rewarded.\n",
        "Tthe film does work, raises a plethora of questions concerning loyalty, violence and the nature of desire, and is in some respects a summation of the various themes that have emerged from Jordan's work.\n",
        "The physical production is as lush as the film's romantic longings.\n",
        "The Crying Game ventures into such exquisitely unique territory that you feel giddy from the pleasure of being allowed to travel along.\n",
        "Reasons remain to watch this movie: the development of Fergus and the fine performances, most notably Whitaker and Richardson, who plays her character with just the right number of screws loose.\n",
        "If you're waiting for something explosive to happen, that may be the case, but if you're absorbing the meticulous and subtle character interaction, the pacing is perfect.\n",
        "For anyone who loves sharp dialogue, compelling characters, and a stinging social rebuke, Glengarry Glen Ross is not to be missed.\n",
        "Mamet reveals his exceptional talent for writing almost poetic working-class vernacular, scores his major implicit thematic thrusts against the nature of the way business-at-large is conducted.\n",
        "David Mamet's play about the wheelings and dealings of real-estate salesmen gets dedicated playing from a splendid cast, but gains nothing by the transfer from stage to screen.\n",
        "Though the performances are satisfying in a projected way, they're nullified by an uninspired atmosphere around them. Despite the colorful and witty utterances of its characters, \"Glengarry\" feels artificial and rarefied.\n",
        "Foley is as adept at managing this intensely psychodramatic material as he is handling an ensemble cast with the combined power of a runaway locomotive.\n",
        "You can see the joy with which these actors get their teeth into these great lines, after living through movies in which flat dialogue serves only to advance the story.\n",
        "The performers achieve a true ensemble rhythm; at times, the entire office seems like a single, shouting organism.\n",
        "Astoundingly tedious.\n",
        "The picture is completely devoid of cinematic interest, adopting instead a tiresome theatrical aesthetic in which showy monologues are filmed in interminable, usually ill-chosen long takes.\n",
        "By the end, the accumulated weight and lethargy of the production fails to invest Sophie's fate with the significance Styron achieves.\n",
        "So perfectly cast and well-imagined that it just takes over and happens to you. It's quite an experience.\n",
        "Though it's far from a flawless movie, Sophie's Choice is a unified and deeply affecting one. Thanks in large part to Miss Streep's bravura performance, it's a film that casts a powerful, uninterrupted spell.\n",
        "It is the kind of film that young people are going to want to see again immediately after they've seen it.\n",
        "An appealing film this new one is, with some charm, some glee in the childrens' triumphs, some share in their friendship with E.T.\n",
        "More than the work of any other filmmaker, Spielberg's output seems uniquely designed to induce in me this queasy false-memory syndrome.\n",
        "On inherent merit, the movie would not warrant such a highly publicized re-release, but this is one of those films that transcends what's on the screen.\n",
        "A contemporary classic.\n",
        "Though marred by Spielberg's usual carelessness with narrative points, the film alternates sweetness and sarcasm with enough rhetorical sophistication to be fairly irresistible.\n",
        "Although conclusively demonstrating Spielberg's preeminence as the popular artist of his time, E.T. finally seems a less impressive film than Close Encounters.\n",
        "What E.T. does so well is to capture that moment in life when childhood seems to be slipping away.\n",
        "[It] may become a children's classic of the space age.\n",
        "A film that connects so beautifully to our sense of wonder and joy.\n",
        "Viewers returning to it, as well as those discovering it, will find it an enduring children's film -- but one whose impact has diminished with the passage of time.\n",
        "If we approach with sympathy and curiosity, we will be rewarded with same. And our souls, not to mention our bicycles, will soar to the heavens.\n",
        "The tenderness of the piece is still intact.\n",
        "A sophisticatedly sappy masterpiece.\n",
        "We have yet to recover from his revelation: that there is nothing more real than sitting in your own back yard -- waiting for the unreal to come down, take a handful of candy, and fly you to the moon.\n",
        "A masterpiece that deserves to be seen and appreciated on a big screen.\n",
        "A sublime modern fairy tale, a movie that, if anything, looks subtler, darker, and more intimate now than it did when originally released.\n",
        "Steven Spielberg's masterful film has lost none of its power to sweep the viewer away in the most 'excellent' late-20th century boy's adventure one could hope for.\n",
        "A magical film.\n",
        "Days of Thunder zigzags between exploiting Cruise's likable grin and charming vulnerability and portraying him as an emotional loser. It's an uncertain and unsatisfying mix.\n",
        "There are plenty of soulless movies around. What's special about Days of Thunder is that it works overtime trying to convince you it's not one of them.\n",
        "In 1990 the people who brought you Top Gun -- Tom Cruise, director Tony Scott, and producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer -- figured out a way to take more of your money, and it involved stock-car racing.\n",
        "A flashy, pre-packaged racing picture featuring stock cars and stock situations.\n",
        "It's one thing to market a film solely on the strength of its star. It's quite another to go ahead and make the film that way.\n",
        "Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer have raised formula films to a science.\n",
        "Exactly what it promises to be: Not Much -- but at dizzying speed, stripped down and free of wind-resistant subtlety. There's a certain integrity to that. A certain deafening integrity.\n",
        "The flash is still there, but Towne has added a layer of substance underneath, and in generous enough helpings that you can let the picture vamp you, ravage you, without hating yourself afterward.\n",
        "An entertainment of great skill but predictable construction.\n",
        "There are elements that hold up - especially Cruise's blinding charisma. The aerial scenes are still thrilling, and perfectly suited to a giant screen. Everything else? Well, that depends on how nostalgic you're feeling.\n",
        "The aerial sequences in Top Gun are as thrilling -- while remaining coherent -- as any ever put on film.\n",
        "Whether you love Top Gun or hate it -- or hate yourself for loving it -- the fact is that when it became the top-grossing film of 1986, Hollywood in its infinite wisdom took all of the worst lessons from its success and overlooked what made it so... fun.\n",
        "Top Gun is about the training of the Navy's best fighter pilots and their blooding in cold war incidents, and the only thing Director Tony Scott has not brought up to date is the story.\n",
        "Every moment is hyped for maximum visual and visceral impact, but Scott doesn't display the slightest bit of interest (or belief) in the actual characters and situations.\n",
        "Set in the world of naval fighter pilots, pic has strong visuals and pretty young people in stylish clothes and a non-stop soundtrack.\n",
        "The story is risible, the direction routine, the underlying ethic highly questionable; but the flying stirs the blood like speed.\n",
        "Once 'Top Gun... gets back to earth, the master of the skies is as clunky as a big land-bound bird.\n",
        "The dogfights are absolutely the best since Clint Eastwood's electrifying aerial scenes in Firefox. But look out for the scenes where the people talk to one another.\n",
        "An unmissable film, made with a delirious compassion.\n",
        "Here is a fairly exciting, suspenseful and provocative, if also occasionally far-fetched, melodrama of unhappy youth on another delinquency kick.\n",
        "Dean's finest film, hardly surprisingly in that Ray was one of the great '50s directors.\n",
        "Like its hero, Rebel Without a Cause desperately wants to say something and doesn't know what it is. If it did know, it would lose its fascination.\n",
        "There are some excruciating flashes of accuracy and truth in this film.\n",
        "An indelible vision of a pretty 1950s America with a searing crack in it.\n",
        "...if the hothouse style was ever justified, this is the occasion.\n",
        "...Kazan achieves a sort of theatrical intensity in which the sweaty realism sometimes clashes awkwardly with the stylisation that heightens the dialogue into a kind of poetry.\n",
        "Inner torments are seldom projected with such sensitivity and clarity on the screen.\n",
        "The camera has done greater justice to the Williams play, catching the nuances and reflected tragedy with an intimacy that is so vital in a story of this type.\n",
        "Brando's performance as Stanley is one of those rare screen legends that are all they're cracked up to be.\n",
        "Despite the overwhelming power of Brando's performance, Streetcar is one of the great ensemble pieces in the movies.\n",
        "Nothing's helped by a hasty ending.\n",
        "Loser lives down to its title.\n",
        "Loser boasts one of the all-time worst codas, with those overused, American Graffiti-inspired on-screen notes moralistically telling you the rotten things that ultimately happened to the rotten people.\n",
        "Biggs, Suvari turn on their winning charm.\n",
        "Biggs is a total dud.\n",
        "It's enjoyable.\n",
        "The end notes of Loser are lame, and it is not encouraging when a college movie means 'aid,' but spells it 'aide.'\n",
        "A better-than-average summer night's entertainment.\n",
        "Loser wins no credits in lusterless college tale.\n",
        "Mind-numbingly witless.\n",

        "A movie with a quirky vision.\n",
        "Though directed in different style, thematically, this period movie is a companion piece to King of New York and The Bad Lieutenant, forming an urban crime trilogy and representing Ferrara's best work.\n",
        "A brilliant, very visceral piece of film-making with an infectious strain of morbid humour.\n",
        "[Ferrara] still finds sharp new ways to explore the nuances of a trite-sounding story.\n",
        "You're engaged on a moral level rarely found in movies about violence.\n",

        "Film after film, Ferrara and St. John are finding new ways to scream.\n",
        "Nussbaum's attempt to capture the 'tween zeitgeist fails: The Spice Girls-infused soundtrack is dated, and the feel-good progressiveness forced.\n",
        "A terrible film.\n",
        "Not overwhelmingly original or funny.\n",
        "Just when the big screen could use an injection of frothy, giggly girl power -- all in the name of a covert feminist message, of course -- Sleepover squanders that promise with a blah story and even bigger bummer of a take-home message.\n",
        "Fairly standard tween-oriented fare.\n",
        "Pleasantly pixilated, if mildly alarming.\n",
        "A good-hearted 'tween comedy hampered by uneven direction and a misguided plot twist.\n",
        "If the pre-adolescents in your life don't have anything better to do than watch this movie, maybe the time has come to teach them hopscotch.\n",
        "There's little in the movie to like, either for tween girls or the unlucky parents who accompany them.\n",
        "If ever a movie could be charged with imperiling the morals of a minor, it's probably Sleepover.\n",
        "A lazy attempt to snare some preadolescent allowance money, Sleepover earns little more than a few bored yawns.\n",
        "Never comes close to living up to its slight potential.\n",
        "The movie is uneven, but it has scored well during previews, and there's a reason: Sleepover fills a niche-audience void.\n",
        "The makers of Sleepover have read the 'tweeners film plot handbook and adhere to it closely.\n",
        "A waste of a hard-earned allowance.\n",
        "A Single Girl delivers 80 unbroken and ultimately irritating minutes in the life of a pretty hotel waitress (Virginie Ledoyen).\n",
        "A stunning demonstration of moral and existential suspense in relation to duration, much like Agnes Varda's 1961 Cleo From 5 to 7.\n",
        "Even though nothing much happens during the course of the movie (Valerie spends over half the running time wandering around the inside of a hotel), this is a thoroughly engrossing motion picture.\n",
        "Benoit Jacquot's small, dazzling film A Single Girl is so buoyant, sharp-eyed and casually sexy it comes closer than any recent movie to capturing the essence of youth itself.\n",
        "A Single Girl shines because of Ledoyen, but sputters in not taking her character anyplace.\n",
        "Try imagining Rain Man without the laughs but with fantasy sequences featuring a Mexican singer in garb out of Chevy Chase's Three Amigos! and a mouse.\n",
        "It's a romantic comedy on the verge of a nervous breakdown.\n",
        "The film looks good and has its funny moments, but too often one senses Anderson straining to impress...\n",
        "It is quite a vision.\n",
        "The journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie.\n",
        "Despite its title, Punch-Drunk Love is never heavy-handed. The jabs it employs are short, carefully placed and dead-center.\n",
        "Easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year.\n",
        "Punch-Drunk Love knows how to reap epic delight from the most precious of details.\n",
        "[Anderson] uses a hit-or-miss aesthetic that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense.\n",
        "It's wacky. It's unpredictable. It's sure to give pause to Sandler fans and, smaller in number but every bit as dedicated, to Watson admirers too.\n",
        "Director Paul Thomas Anderson hasn't reinvented Sandler; he's just allowed those of us who tired very quickly of his innocent naif shtick to see how effectively it can be put in the service of something to care about.\n",
        "Everything about Punch-Drunk Love works in a Being John Malkovich sort of way save one. Sandler. When your star doesn't work, it's hard to get us to buy into the rest of a movie as unusual as this.\n",
        "In Punch-Drunk Love, Adam Sandler doesn't so much discard his old persona as illuminate it, breathing life into the cardboard characters that populated his earlier films.\n",
        "How odd that a tribute to a wildly theatrical presence should turn out so dull and prosaic.\n",
        "It is already apparent that Punch-Drunk Love will not be everyone's cup of tea, but nonetheless Mr. Anderson has found a way to fashion a passionate romance out of the materials of postmodern chaos.\n",
        "A weird, arresting little ride.\n",
        "A weirdly sweet little love story set in waltz time and filmed as a study in contrast: light and dark, order and chaos, delicate music and ear-bending noise.\n",
        "Sandler is quite winning, but he doesn't stretch so much as deepen the same character he always plays.\n",
        "The film is exhilarating to watch because Sandler, liberated from the constraints of formula, reveals unexpected depths as an actor.\n",
        "[Sandler] plays Barry just as he would any of the comic dolts who've made him rich but this time all the panicky sadness is out where we can see it. It's a honey of a performance: controlled, achingly human, and funny in the deepest ways.\n",
        "An exultant comedy of American repression and revolt.\n",
        "A brave, spectacularly entertaining -- and unexpectedly stirring -- account of Flynt's life that asks us to regard the publisher of Hustler magazine as an invaluable champion of our First Amendment freedoms.\n",
        "One of the truly bizarre careers in recent American cultural life provides the source of tart and tasty amusement in The People vs. Larry Flynt.\n",
        "Woody Harrelson plays Flynt with energy, and Courtney Love does at least as well as his wife.\n",
        "We're really celebrating Hollywood's freedom to create biographies of anyone, no matter how high or low on the social ladder, and still come up with the same banal characteristics, messages and conclusions.\n",
        "The exploitative misogyny of Flynt's output is never examined, the prurient hypocrisy and intolerance of his persecutors seriously overplayed, plus Larry and Althea's odd romance lacks bittersweet conviction.\n",
        "It's a modern-day Capra film, about an unorthodox businessman who's persecuted for his originality but eventually is recognized for the lovable, rugged American individualist he truly is.\n",
        "Thanks to the light humour, it's consistently engaging; yet minus that darker shading, it's never fully convincing.\n",
        "In its excesses and extravagances, its fascination with sex, religion, celebrity, bad taste and making a whole lot of money, there is no more American story than that of combative pornographer and Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt.\n",
        "Smart, funny, shamelessly entertaining and perfectly serious too.\n",
        "Like 12 Angry Men, it's a civics lesson that will still be regaling film enthusiasts four decades hence.\n",
        "An enormously entertaining and surprisingly touching bio-pic.\n",
        "You don't have to like the man to support his struggles and enjoy this dramatization of them.\n",
        "Love proves she is not a rock star pretending to act, but a true actress, and Harrelson matches her with his portrait of a man who has one thing on his mind, and never changes it.\n",
        "The People vs. Larry Flynt is ultimately a worse disappointment than an out-and-out stinker would be, because of its lively, entertaining first half.\n",
        "What fun it is to watch.\n",
        "Shrewd, involving\n",
        "An encouraging item from the film is the claim that, of those who considered honesty and ethics important considerations in choosing a senator, three-fourths voted against North.\n",
        "A fine, trenchant political documentary on a par with The War Room\n",
        "Fascinating, if more than a little depressing\n",
        "One of a small handful of essential films about politics in this country.\n",
        "Personalities are being sold, not parties or philosophies, and A Perfect Candidate makes that process even more interesting because one candidate, Robb, apparently has no personality at all, while the other, North, has two.\n",
        "The film fails as a portrait of a man. But as an insider's look at a Senate campaign, it holds interest.\n",
        "There is a natural rhythm to the film that makes its own quiet, life-affirming statement.\n",
        "When it sometimes seems the whole society has spiritually decamped for Tinseltown, the movie offers the hope that people can come home again-at least for a visit.\n",
        "Without question, these are major, meaty roles for Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda, and there could have been little doubt that the two would work superbly together.\n",
        "Two of Hollywood's best-loved veterans deserved a far better swan song than this sticky confection.\n",
        "Watching the movie, I felt I was witnessing something rare and valuable.\n",
        "On Golden Pond is a mixed blessing, but it offers one performance of rare quality and three others that are very good. That's not half-bad.\n",
        "The cinematic equivalent of shrink-wrapping, in which all of the ideas, feelings, characters, and images are neatly separated and hermetically sealed to prevent spoilage, abrasion, or any contact with the natural world.\n",
        "A firstrate underwater suspenser with an otherworldly twist, The Abyss suffers from a payoff unworthy of its buildup.\n",
        "The attempt to extract the essences of several genres (cold-war submarine thriller, love story, Disney fantasy, pseudomystical SF in the Spielberg mode) and mix them together ultimately leads to giddy incoherence.\n",
        "This overlong concoction is scuppered by dire dialogue, histrionic performances and maudlin sentimentality.\n",
        "Anyone looking for a discouraging word about this stupendously exciting and emotionally engulfing film should read no further. The Abyss confirms James Cameron as a world-class filmmaker.\n",
        "The human stuff is more than worth the descent.\n",
        "I'd sooner believe that Moby Dick could swim up the drainpipe.\n",
        "Never will you wish more fervently for an Adrienne Barbeau cameo, just for old time's sake. Your prayers will be in vain.\n",
        "The production values are above par, but as in Carpenter's original, seeing ghosts is less scary than imagining them.\n",
        "Yet another anaemic horror retread starring a cast of good-looking TV totty.\n",
        "Mildly scary here and there.\n",
        "Like most remakes, The Fog is pretty unnecessary.\n",
        "Making concessions at every turn to the youth-horror market, the film slashes the ages of its protagonists by some 15 years, and its IQ follows suit.\n",
        "A film riddled with missed opportunities for good clean scares.\n",
        "We're meant to be unsettled by digital spectres, reckless Mack trucks, and rotting old pirates who look every bit as terrifying as the guy on the Fisherman's Friend cold-lozenge box.\n",
        "Lock your doors. Bolt your windows. And for heaven's sake, stay away from the multiplex.\n",
        "I was held in suspense throughout The Fog, aching to learn the answer to its central riddle: Why would any one remake such a crummy movie?\n",
        "The fog also does something genuinely eerie: It causes everyone in the cast to deliver dreadful performances and display inappropriate reactions when their friends are drowned, burned, stabbed or thrown into glass display cases.\n",
        "Add one more to the list of unnecessary horror remakes.\n",
        "It's typical of pic's adherence to rigid genre conventions that the very first victims are brazen hotties who are shown drinking, dancing and wearing revealing attire prior to their deaths.\n",
        "This Fog lacks the one thing the original had -- originality -- but it qualifies as more than a mist opportunity.\n",
        "The movie proudly wears its affection for crusty Sergio Leone archetypes and countdown-clock suspense sequences; Carpenter was Tarantino long before Tarantino was.\n",
        "It's a rare film that has so many ideas and yet fails so consistently to make use of them.\n",
        "A solidly satisfying actioner.\n",
        "The plot gradually winds down into predictable though highly enoyable histrionics.\n",
        "It's a toughly told, very tall tale, one of the best escape (and escapist) movies of the season.\n",
        "When the final credits roll, you can be forgiven a vague sense of dissatisfaction, because the creativity that went into formulating the premise was never extended to the script writing stage.\n",
        "The point of the film is not to create suspense, but to capture the relentlessness of human greed, the feeling that the land is so important the human spirit can be sacrificed to it.\n",
        "You may also become permanently sick of goats. But after Jean, a rich residue of themes and images remains -- much as after reading a long but great novel or Greek tragedy.\n",
        "Berri also remains a boringly uninteresting director, dotting every i and crossing every t with nothing much on his mind but platitude.\n",
        "Berri is unable to overcome the inherent feebleness of the Manon character, here played ineffectually by the lovely and talented Emmanuelle Beart.\n",
        "There is a satisfying symmetry to events, with Manon able to take her revenge on the Soubeyrans.\n",
        "The acting, from that of the four major stars to the numerous supporting cast members, is without flaw.\n",
        "The movie is stuffed with cues for arias that are never heard.\n",
        "All of this takes place with the implacable pace of a Greek tragedy.\n",
        "Though appealing in its wispy way, Manon is only a continental soap opera.\n",
        "Auteil's Ugolin is so well drawn, it's a shame to see the role lost.\n",
        "The shame is that the film doesn't convey more mess or danger; its sex and its politics are almost entirely dinner-table-friendly.\n",
        "It's delightfully playful for a serious movie, balancing glib wit against its pathos and controversy.\n",
        "The great thing about Kinsey is the triumphant way it entertains, informs and electrifies us with the highest values of traditional cinema while opening our hearts and minds with the liberating potential of human diversity.\n",
        "The biopic succumbs to a paint-by-numbers feel as it dutifully touches the highs and lows of a life that can't easily fit within two hours.\n",
        "Smart, eloquent and refreshingly free of condescension, Kinsey makes clear we'd all be a lot worse off without him.\n",
        "One heck of a flick, paying homage to an imperfect man whose impact on history may be substantial, and yet painting him as a clumsy, passionate fellow who's simply trying to figure things out.\n",
        "I can't imagine the performances, or much else, being improved on.\n",
        "It's a new Neeson as Dr. Alfred Kinsey, all spiky-haired and harried, and he's enormously appealing in the role.\n",
        "It's partly a scientific brief, partly a song of sex, and it's enormously enjoyable.\n",
        "[Neeson] makes the movie better than it is by filling in the rough patches with a portrayal so committed, so nuanced, that this may be the role he's remembered for (and which may finally win him an Oscar).\n",
        "Succeeds, in part, because the film is as non-judgmental as the famed sex researcher himself.\n",
        "There's a flatness to the filmmaking; what's needed here is a lot more va-va in its va-va-voom.\n",
        "A convincing picture of an America semiconsciously cowered in fear and ignorance about sexuality.\n",
        "The humour is rich but never bawdy.\n",
        "It's the biography of a sex pioneer disguised as a love story, or a romance with some rather intriguing side issues, and it begins with one of cinema's more intriguing pickup lines: 'I've been reading up on gall wasps.'\n",
        "It's a film Kinsey himself might have appreciated: It's sober, never flashy or exciting but always engrossing, both for its penetration into Kinsey's psychology and for the effects his findings are shown to have on the world and the people around him.\n",
        "Straight from the first frames, writer-director Bill Condon adroitly tackles the problem that all biopics about accomplished people invariably bump up against: How to marry the life to the work, dramatizing one without slighting the other?\n",
        "Not only does Kinsey flow with the purpose of biographical narrative, it provides a compelling portrait of a momentous shift in American culture.\n",
        "Condon presents Kinsey's life in an upbeat fashion that's unafraid of the language of the conventional biopic. The subject is unconventional enough to eliminate any need for stylistic embellishment.\n",
        "Here is Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which is neither as sparkling as it is said to be nor as bad as it seems to be at the start. But it's pretty good.\n",
        "Grail is as funny as a movie can get, but it is also a tough-minded picture -- as outraged about the human propensity for violence as it is outrageous in its attack on that propensity.\n",
        "Silly, sophomoric, and slapped together -- but would you want it any other way?\n",
        "Monty Python's Flying Circus, the British comedy group which gained fame via BBC-TV, send-up Arthurian legend, performed in whimsical fashion with Graham Chapman an effective straight man as King Arthur.\n",
        "Python's delightful and, on the whole, consistent reductio ad absurdum of the Grail legend.\n",
        "A marvelously particular kind of lunatic endeavor.\n",
        "Holy Grail suffers from the same syndrome that afflicts many of these restored classics: It is better remembered than actually seen.\n",
        "For all its shenanigans, Monty Python and the Holy Grail has a sense of humor that is intellectual, even academic, at heart.\n",
        "Ah, bless the Pythons, back after 26 years to get medieval all over again on the legend of King Arthur and his knights of the round table.\n",
        "The funniest movie of 1975 and probably the silliest movie ever made.\n",
        "Really smart people improvising really silly gags and bits, most of which work, some of which don't.\n",
        "Has been so quoted and requoted that the scenes and words feel tattooed onto the psychic membrane.\n",
        "Monty Python and the Holy Grail still stands as a gloriously silly and twisted send-up.\n",
        "Brimming over with unforgettable gags and baroquely nonsensical insults.\n",
        "The new Holy Grail is no revelation, just hilarious confirmation that the old days were in fact better.\n",
        "An incredibly silly film of great humor, brilliant design and epic insanity.\n",
        "Represents one of the best and brightest comedies ever to shine from the silver screen.\n",
        "Cast of unknowns bring the various characters to vivid life, which may be the problem. This plays so realistically that viewers may not get the satire...\n",
        "A poor imitation of The Big Chill--lesbian style--poorly executed and schematically written.\n",
        "Recalling The Return of the Secaucus Seven rather than the more expensive but more superficial The Big Chill, Everything Relative is one of the best lesbian films yet.\n",
        "A mixed bag.\n",
        "The kind of movie where only some of the characters have last names, this essentially sweet-natured enterprise feels slightly rushed and distracted.\n",
        "Director O'Haver fails to supply any proper shape or development.\n",
        "A sweet teen romance flick.\n",
        "Shakespeare probably made the point best: Teens rule; parents drool.\n",
        "Get Over It is mostly an amateur hour fiasco.\n",
        "Get Over It breaks the formula for teen romances.\n",
        "May be halfhearted, but it's not entirely without heart.\n",
        "Scarcely enough story for a half-hour TV sitcom.\n",
        "A breath of fresh air.\n",
        "Underneath all the fuss, there's a half-baked plot that fails to make much of a connection.\n",
        "It's predictable but charming.\n",
        "Comes off more like a series of painful cliches than a comedy or a love story.\n",
        "A blithe-spirited comedy.\n",
        "Offers a departure (albeit not a radical one) from the norm.\n",
        "A teen movie that for once delivers brains along with babes and buffoons.\n",
        "Deserves to be applauded for not casting Freddie Prinze Jr., but this sloppy, somnolent, strung-together flick pales when compared to such other teenage riffs on classic literature as Clueless and 10 Things I Hate About You.\n",
        "The surprising part is how, once you get over the crude humor that the teen-movie genre demands, Get Over It is a nice little movie.\n",
        "Schlondorff has a tendency to sketch the rest of the cast as simple grotesques or symbols of decadence that are unconvincingly humanized in the final third.\n",
        "Two or Three Things I Know About Her is one of the most beautiful films of the young Jean-Luc Godard, a great French cineaste, poet and frustrated lover.\n",
        "Based on a series of magazine articles, the movie was made around the time Godard abandoned conventional narrative almost entirely for what he dubbed the cinematic essay.\n",
        "he her in the title of Jean-Luc Godard's 1967 film is meant to be Paris. There is, however, another 'her.'\n",
        "Despite an aura of wistfulness, and a certain power that accrues from the disjunction between the story of a vulnerable, life-hardened woman, the chaotic collision of sound and image, and the ham-handed political lessons, this film never moves me.\n",
        "Raoul Coutard's Techniscope cinematography contemplates an espresso, filling the screen in monumental close-up with a rotating vortex of bubbles and foam.\n",
        "Too good to miss.\n",
        "There is certainly enough of wit and beauty, though, to keep the film afloat.\n",
        "Godard is as relaxed in the film as in the title.\n",
        "Though poorly received on its first release, this 1966 film seems in retrospect one of Godard's most stimulating investigations of images and surfaces -- the meanings they convey and the webs they spin.\n",
        "It unfortunately has an unfinished quality, and plays very much like a good first draft for a much better movie than the one on view.\n",
        "Together, these characters discover the ideas of faith and fellowship as the film congratulates itself on its noble instincts.\n",
        "A goofy, goodwill gesture toward the U.S. Postal Service, it's never funny and moves slower than an unaddressed letter without postage.\n",
        "As trite as the framework is, Dear God might have been a charming holiday film, if only its miracles weren't so trite.\n",
        "Awkward cuts rob the film of cohesion, and even the charming Kinnear seems to disappear at times amid the chaos -- a real test of viewers' faith.\n",
        "Though aspiring to Capraesque whimsy, Dear God feels and looks like a faded rerun of Marshall's Happy Days.\n",
        "A sickeningly bad pastiche of much better pictures.\n",
        "It is a limp, lifeless story starring Greg Kinnear as a con man who becomes a do-gooder, and one of its many problems is that he was a lot more entertaining as a con man.\n",
        "A sometimes brilliant if overloaded pseudodocumentary satire.\n",
        "A sort of political This Is Spinal Tap, Bob Roberts is both a stimulating social satire and, for thinking people, a depressing commentary on the devolution of the American political system.\n",
        "Bob Roberts is not merely a satirical fictional biopic, but a wry exploration of the relationship between political reality and manufactured image.\n",
        "A very funny, sometimes prescient satire of American politics, and of the comparatively small, voting portion of the electorate that makes a Bob Roberts phenomenon possible.\n",
        "Tim Robbins inaugurates the fall season with a slashingly funny political satire that ranks with the year's best films.\n",
        "Robbins, who scripted and directed, creates more than enough on his own. Bob's un-hackneyed character is the prime case in point.\n",
        "Watching it might be an education for some voters, who will recognize in the movie political techniques they see being practiced all the time in real life.\n",
        "A welcome injection of venom.\n",
        "Returning to cinemas in spiffily remastered form ... the film retains its wide-eyed charm, pitched halfway between unrestrained romanticism and unknowing kitsch.\n",
        "The heightened symmetry of this new/old Cinema Paradiso makes the film a fuller experience, like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time.\n",
        "In the director's cut, the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush, all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes.\n",
        "The film's final hour, where nearly all the previous unseen material resides, is unconvincing soap opera that Tornatore was right to cut.\n",
        "Still rapturous after all these years, Cinema Paradiso stands as one of the great films about movie love.\n",
        "This director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera.\n",
        "Where the original release was an essay in childish delight and adolescent longing, topped off by a muted coda implying that you really can go home again, the reissue is a fully realized epic of the heart.\n",
        "I'm happy to have seen it -- not as an alternate version, but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes.\n",
        "Less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990.\n",
        "As it turns out, you can go home again.\n",
        "I don't think most of the people who loved the 1989 Paradiso will prefer this new version. But I do.\n",
        "This version moves beyond the original's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema's inability to stand in for true, lived experience.\n",
        "The new version isn't just endless. It heightens the deeply conservative spirit of Giuseppe Tornatore's fable in a surprising new way.\n",
        "More romantic, more emotional and ultimately more satisfying than the teary-eyed original.\n",
        "Anyone who feels as attached to the history of movies as Tornatore obviously does, there are more than enough irresistible moments.\n",
        "This film is sometimes funny, sometimes joyful, and sometimes poignant, but it's always warm, wonderful, and satisfying.\n",
        "It is, in a word, exquisite.\n",
        "For the most part, this hamfisted movie is very enjoyable.\n",
        "Albert is one of the ugliest characters ever brought to the screen. Ignorant, over-bearing and violent, it's a gloriously rich performance by Gambon.\n",
        "For a Jacobean-style drama about deadly emotions, the film lacks passion; only in the final half-hour, with Michael Nyman's funereal music supplying a welcome gravity, does it at last exert a stately power.\n",
        "A work so intelligent and powerful that it evokes our best emotions and least civil impulses, so esthetically brilliant that it expands the boundaries of film itself.\n",
        "It doesn't simply make a show of being uncompromising -- it is uncompromised in every single shot from beginning to end.\n",
        "Greenaway, the bemused, coolly ironic truth-teller, has painted a cruel portrait for a cruel time.\n",
        "Taboos? If director Peter Greenaway has any, you can't tell by this film.\n",
        "Give or take another masterpiece coming down the pike, this intricately assembled, viscerally provocative tract on consumerism gone full and grisly circle, is without a doubt, the most accomplished, astounding film of the year.\n",
        "It's probably safe to say that the British director Peter Greenaway holds the ugliest view of mankind ever put forth by a maker of feature films.\n",
        "With its molelike inhabitants, its sprawling war between flesh-eaters and lentil-men, its achingly sweet love story and surrealist blend of dusty antiquities and 21st-century gizmos, Delicatessen is indescribably wild.\n",
        "All of this is handled in a breezy, off-handed, nutsy manner, as the superb cast combines to help bring it off.\n",
        "Delicatessen is a fearsomely intense movie that mixes moods with formidable assurance.\n",
        "With their detached, sardonic and decidedly sick slant, Jeunet and Caro have served up a burnt-to-a-crisp feast.\n",
        "There are no characters to care about or remember afterward -- just a lot of flashy technique involving decor, some glib allegorical flourishes, and the obligatory studied film-school weirdness.\n",
        "A zany little film that's a startling and clever debut for co-helmers Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro.\n",
        "Increasingly inventive as it progresses, Jeunet and Caro's fast, funny feature debut entertains from sinister start to frantic finish.\n",
        "Its last half-hour is devoted chiefly to letting the characters wreck the sets, and quite literally becomes a washout when the bathtub overflows.\n",
        "A laboriously self-conscious attempt at being avant-garde.\n",
        "Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film leaves you overwhelmed and breathless.\n",
        "We see through a glass darkly, and often confusingly, but at least we see.\n",
        "Don't even attempt to resolve that paradox, and The Double Life of Veronique will work on its own poetic terms.\n",
        "A mesmerizing poetic work composed in an eerie minor key.\n",
        "It operates purely on visual juxtapositions, emotion and the presence of lead actress Irene Jacob. In its own terms, it's subtly precious.\n",
        "The parts do not quite fit, and anyway this is not a puzzle to be assembled. It is a romance about those moments we all sometimes have when we think we see ourselves at a distance.\n",
        "In a raucous movie summer, this is a film for those who appreciate wisteria and sunshine, and a recollection of a time when women and movies could be purveyors of enchantment.\n",
        "Strong cast's reliable playing is undercut by a script that dawdles over well-trod territory.\n",
        "Personalities clash but are cheerfully reconciled, and marital tensions are swiftly resolved.\n",
        "The ladies are well bred, the scenery is lovely and the dialogue is polished and polite. It helps that the same villa in Portofino where Miss von Armin wrote the novel has been used to fine effect as the film's principal setting.\n",
        "Is it fair to ask why usually sophisticated Americans turn to mush over this particular variety of moribund ersatz art?\n",
        "Personalities clash but are cheerfully reconciled, and marital tensions are swiftly resolved.\n",
        "It would seem from a spate of films lately that the English can only find their warmer, truer selves abroad -- usually in Italy. Enchanted April takes this familiar path, but traipses along with charm and glory, as if for the very first time.\n",
        "That's what's appealing about the movie (everyone walks away happy) and also forgettable (everyone walks away mush).\n",
        "More than 20 years after Mr. Cobb's novel was first published, Mr. Kubrick reminded us that human folly is rarely checked for long. A half-century on, he is still right.\n",
        "Kirk Douglas gives one of his finest performances as the intelligent and courageous Col. Dax.\n",
        "The sardonic rhetoric may be laid on a little heavily at times, but the movie is blunt and scornfully brilliant.\n",
        "While the subject is well handled and enacted in a series of outstanding characterizations, it seems dated and makes for grim screen fare.\n",
        "This masterpiece still packs a wallop, though nothing in it is as simple as it may first appear; audiences are still arguing about the final sequence, which has been characterized as everything from a sentimental cop-out to the ultimate cynical twist.\n",
        "The final scene, in which Kubrick presents close-ups of soldiers watching a captured German girl being forced to sing for their pleasure is nothing short of masterful.\n",
        "Songs at the ends of dramas usually make us feel better. They are part of closure. This song at the end of this movie makes us feel more forlorn.\n",
        "Paths of Glory is all about that greatest of all movie subjects: power.\n",
        "There's a near mathematical logic to the scenario and the cruelty is compounded by class.\n",
        "Both a terrifying, grim look at battle and an excruciatingly tense courtroom thriller. Together, it's a devastating indictment of war as conducted by opportunists and liars.\n",
        "As for the picture's significance, it comes to an inconclusive point.\n",
        "Could this possibly be the Casablanca of the late 20th century?\n",
        "It's the sort of solemn production that is often mentioned as an Academy Award contender.This says less about the quality of the film than it does about its self-consciously lofty tone and its sense of self-importance.\n",
        "The film is a smashing success on its own terms, though as a transcendent love story it lacks the firm foundation in human reality that characterizes Lars Von Trier's superior Breaking the Waves.\n",
        "With its fine acting, sumptuous visuals and levels of intrigue, The English Patient boasts the elements of something greater than a love story. Too bad it devotes them to something less than a great love story.\n",
        "The triumph of the film lies not just in the force and range of the performances, but in Minghella's creation of an intimate epic: vast landscapes mingle with the minute details of desire, and the combination is transfixing.\n",
        "Out of each of these uprooted characters are spun stories of love, loyalty and betrayal.\n",
        "The cast is superb: Binoche, with her thin, seraphic smile; Scott Thomas, aware of the spell she casts but not flaunting it; Fiennes, especially, radiating sexy mystery, threat shrouded in hauteur. Doom and drive rarely have so much stately star quality.\n",
        "A respectable, intelligent but less than stirring adaptation of an imposingly dense and layered novel.\n",
        "This is the real thing, and real things don't come along very often, so you'd better snap them up when they do.\n",
        "For all the film's effectiveness as a love story, I often felt I was being hurried through a busy itinerary.\n",
        "The result is completely intoxicating.\n",
        "Needless to say, the performances are flawless; more surprising is the fluency, poetry and scale of Minghella's direction.\n",
        "Torrid, witty, passionate and intelligent.\n",
        "Get ready for the great romance of the movie year.\n",
        "The English Patient captivates as only the grandest and most consuming passions can.\n",
        "A stunning feat of literary adaptation as well as a purely cinematic triumph.\n",
        "The English Patient, the superb new film by Anthony Minghella, is that rarest of things: a film based on a great contemporary novel.\n",
        "This poetic, evocative film version of the famous novel by Michael Ondaatje circles down through layers of mystery until all of the puzzles in the story have been solved, and only the great wound of a doomed love remains.\n",
        "This is one of the year's most unabashed and powerful love stories, using flawless performances, intelligent dialogue, crisp camera work, and loaded glances to attain a level of eroticism and emotional connection that many similar films miss.\n",
        "All performances are on the mark in this perfect little film.\n",
        "For all his character's travails the film as a whole winds up surprisingly upbeat.\n",
        "Day Lewis' re-creation of writer/painter Christy Brown's condition is so precise, so detailed and so matter-of-fact that it transcends the carping about casting an actor without cerebral palsy.\n",
        "An intelligent, beautifully acted adaptation of Christy Brown's first book.\n",
        "My Left Foot is a great film for many reasons, but the most important is that it gives us such a complete picture of this man's life.\n",
        "Not only does Day-Lewis master the physical aspects of the role, the minute-to-minute struggle of almost complete paralysis, he lives the painful genesis of an artistic character.\n",
        "Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot must be the most passionately empathetic film about a physical affliction ever made.\n",
        "What amazes is that at just 26, Soderbergh displays the three qualities associated with mature filmmakers: a unique authorial voice, a spooky camera assurance, and the easy control of ensemble acting.\n",
        "This is a sexy, nuanced, beautifully controlled examination of how a quartet of people are defined by their erotic impulses and inhibitions.\n",
        "The actors are superb; working from Soderbergh's funny, perceptive, immaculately wrought dialogue, they ensure that the film stimulates both intellectually and emotionally.\n",
        "A film whose enormous authority and intelligence extend to every detail.\n",
        "A movie of prodigious power and feeling that is also high-spirited, hilarious and scorchingly erotic.\n",
        "Inspired chitchat, a barefaced Louisiana gabfest written and directed by Steven Soderbergh, a 26-year-old Wunderkind preoccupied with l'amour.\n",
        "Wwriter/director/editor Soderbergh has composed a wry, highly watchable piece that comes across as a great first effort by a film-school graduate.\n",
        "It is never boring, and there are moments when it reminds us of how sexy the movies used to be, back in the days when speech was an erogenous zone.\n",
        "Lean, economical, relatively unpretentious (or at least pretentiously unpretentious), and purposefully small-scale.\n",
        "Mr. Almodovar's comic invention runs out too soon, leaving the audience to giggle weakly in anticipation of the big laughs and disorienting shocks that never arrive.\n",
        "A writer-director driven by his passion, Almodovar allows his movies to moan and sweat and writhe. Sex looks like sex, not pornographic but messy and warm. The curtains do not billow, the sheets burn.\n",
        "Almodovar's polarities are so perfectly lined up in opposition to my own that it is quite possible for one of his movies to shoot right through my brain without striking a single cell.\n",
        "There's a lot here. But with a classic like Cuckoo's Nest, too much is never enough.\n",
        "One Flew over the Cuckoo 's Nest is an earnest attempt to make a serious film. But in the end the movie backs away from both the human reality and the cloudy but potent symbolism that Ken Kesey found in the asylum.\n",
        "Viewed 30 years after its release, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest remains a very good motion picture, although one that perhaps just misses the pinnacle of greatness where its reputation suggests it resides.\n",
        "Jack Nicholson stars in an outstanding characterization of Ken Kesey's asylum anti-hero, McMurphy, and Milos Forman's direction of a superbly-cast film is equally meritorious.\n",
        "Jack Nicholson plays McMurphy as if he were born to it, and the supporting cast provides fine, detailed performances.\n",
        "Set in an insane asylum, the film involves the oppression of the individual, a struggle spearheaded by an ebullient Nicholson, turning in a star performance if ever there was one.\n",
        "Even granting the artist his license, America is much too big and various to be satisfactorily reduced to the dimensions of one mental ward in a movie like this.\n",
        "Is One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest not a great film because it is manipulative, or is it great because it is so superbly manipulative? I can see it through either filter.\n",
        "What's lacking in Up in Smoke is a cohesiveness in both humor and characterization.\n",
        "Director Lou Adler (the record producer) finds a few chuckles, but mostly it's amateur night.\n",
        "As the most fun comes not from watching the movie but from recalling great lines later, it would seem that the audio success of C & C has not translated too well into visuals.\n",
        "In many ways the new film is a better film than Star Wars, visually more exciting, more artful and meticulous in detail.\n",
        "The Empire Strikes Back is a worthy sequel to Star Wars, equal in both technical mastery and characterization, suffering only from the familiarity with the effects generated in the original and imitated too much by others.\n",
        "Irvin Kershner directed the actors this time around, and without the benefit of Lucas's personal affection they seem stiffer, more clenched.\n",
        "An extended ricochet from one incendiary set-piece battle to another which still finds time to attend to plot, pace and character.\n",
        "The total effect is fast and attractive and occasionally amusing. Like a good hot dog, that's something of an achievement in a field where unpalatable junk is the rule.\n",
        "It is a visual extravaganza from beginning to end, one of the most visionary and inventive of all films.\n",
        "The Empire Strikes Back is a technological triumph, a cornucopia of intergalactic tchotchkes.\n",
        "The balance between action and mysticism in Empire provides fascinating energy.\n",
        "A superior motion picture!\n",
        "In the glory days of science fiction, critics wrote about the 'sense of wonder.' That's what The Empire Strikes Back creates in us\n",
        "I found myself glancing at my watch almost as often as I did when I was sitting through a truly terrible movie called The Island.\n",
        "A dramatic illustration of the continued technical brilliance and leadership of the Lucas production team.\n",
        "Star Wars made my eyes pop out when I first saw it in 1977!\n",
        "The most classic in its style, design and narrative.\n",
        "It balances bloodshed with charm, spectacle with childlike glee. It's a near flawless movie of its kind.\n",
        "For many Star Wars fans, this second installment is the best of the George Lucas trilogy: a dark, ultimately melancholy, even philosophical episode that has no triumphant happy ending.\n",
        "The storytelling is the series' best, with a zingy balance of drama, humor, and Deep Thoughts.\n",
        "As you watch this enchanting fantasy, feel free to be thrilled or to giggle, as you wish.\n",
        "Patinkin, the most dazzling movie swordsman since Errol Flynn, steals the movie with his athletic grace and delivery of lines like: \"My name is Inigo Montoya! Prepare to die!\"\n",
        "For parents who have felt as if they were approaching the Cliffs of Insanity while enduring the inanities of standard kiddie pictures, The Princess Bride may be a godsend.\n",
        "Heroic fantasies, we often feel, should be lighter than air, hot as dragon fire, fast as a sword in sunlight. And that's mostly what we get from the delightful The Princess Bride -- along with some bracing humor and foolery.\n",
        "The film works well enough, providing its fair share of laughs and thrills, and in technical terms it is by far Reiner`s most professional job of direction.\n",
        "Based on William Goldman's novel, this is a post-modern fairy tale that challenges and affirms the conventions of a genre that may not be flexible enough to support such horseplay.\n",
        "Rob Reiner's friendly 1987 fairy-tale adventure delicately mines the irony inherent in its make-believe without ever undermining the effectiveness of the fantasy.\n",
        "The leads are vacuous; the absurdities sometimes forced and obvious.\n",
        "Since its release more than 15 years ago, The Princess Bride has often been copied, but never equaled.\n",
        "This material might easily have lent itself to broad parody or become too cute for its own good. But Mr. Reiner presents it as a bedtime story, pure and simple.\n",
        "It is filled with good-hearted fun.\n",
        "Bride achieves much more than most film comedies.\n",
        "It's a lively, fun-loving, but nevertheless epic look at the nature of true love.\n",
        "Yes, it's as entertaining as you have heard. Maybe more so. Raiders of the Lost Ark is, in fact, about as entertaining as a commercial movie can be.\n",
        "Raiders of the Lost Ark has it all -- or, anyway, more than enough to transport moviegoers back to the dazzling, thrill-sated matinee idyls of old.\n",
        "The thrills are fully consumed while you're seeing this movie, and it's totally over when it's over. It's a workout. You feel as if you'd been to the desert digs: at the end your mind is blank, yet you're parched, you're puffing hard -- you want relief.\n",
        "...a crackerjack fantasy-adventure that shapes its pulp sensibilities and cliff-hanging serial origins into an exhilarating escapist entertainment that will have broad-cased summer audiences in the palm of its hand.\n",
        "One would think that a collaboration between Steven Spielberg and George Lucas would produce something better than this giggly pastiche of a Republic serial...\n",
        "Whether you swallow it or not, see it for a handful of totally unexpected visual jokes, worth the price of admission alone.\n",
        "This is the kind of movie that, even today, audiences immediately fall in love with. It has all the right ingredients: a smart script, a likable hero, a dash of romance, more than a touch of comedy, and a lot of fast-paced action.\n",
        "To get to the point immediately, Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the most deliriously funny, ingenious and stylish American adventure movies ever made.\n",
        "The movie is just plain fun.\n",
        "[A] darkly funny and truly visionary retro-futurist fantasy.\n",
        "Brazil is a stinging, Strangelovian satire of the power of the bureaucracy in an Orwellian landscape.\n",
        "Brazil offers a chillingly hilarious vision of the near-future.\n",
        "Terry Gilliam's ferociously creative black comedy is filled with wild tonal contrasts, swarming details, and unfettered visual invention -- every shot carries a charge of surprise and delight.\n",
        "Fortunately the story of an alternative future is realised with such visual imagination and sparky humour that it's only half way through that the plot's weaknesses become apparent.\n",
        "A superb example of the power of comedy to underscore serious ideas, even solemn ones.\n",
        "For all its occasional long-windedness and visual dazzle, Brazil may be the Strangelove of the 1980s.\n",
        "Gilliam understood that all futuristic films end up quaintly evoking the naive past in which they were made, and turned the principle into a coherent comic aesthetic.\n",
        "Very hard to follow.\n",
        "[Aliens] is a spectacular example of state-of-the-art science fiction simply because it never tries to be overtly spectacular.\n",
        "It's blaster action, not Gothic future-horror. Fortunately, director-screenwriter James Cameron has shaped his film around the defiant intelligence and sensual athleticism of Weaver, and that's where Aliens works best.\n",
        "This film is also the best monster movie of the year and the best picture of any kind to open so far this summer. Put it another way: Aliens is the Jaws of the '80s.\n",
        "Action thrillers assail but rarely test us; this is the tautest, most provoking, and altogether most draining example ever made.\n",
        "Count me out of the fan club for this one.\n",
        "The trouble Ripley has found this time is exponentially bigger and scarier than anything she encountered in Ridley Scott's memorably minimalist, eerily elegant 1979 film.\n",
        "One sequel that surpasses the original.\n",
        "There is always an interesting tension in Cameron's work between masculine and feminine qualities. When it finally hits the fan here, we're in for the mother of all battles.\n",
        "A flaming, flashing, crashing, crackling blow-'em-up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics.\n",
        "Makes up for lack of surprise with sheer volume of thrills and chills.\n",
        "When it comes to the logical marriage of action, adventure, and science fiction, few films are as effective or accomplished as Aliens.\n",
        "The ads for Aliens claim that this movie will frighten you as few movies have, and, for once, the ads don't lie.\n",
        "\"Absolutely smashing!\"\n",
        "All three arrive at the cache at the same time. Who gets it? Director Leone doesn't seem to care very much, and after 161 minutes of mayhem, audiences aren't likely to either.\n",
        "The third in the Clint Eastwood series of Italo westerns, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is exactly that -- a curious amalgam of the visually striking, the dramatically feeble and the offensively sadistic.\n",
        "Though ordained from the beginning, the three-way showdown that climaxes the film is tense and thoroughly astonishing.\n",
        "Sergio Leone's grandiose 1966 western epic is nothing less than a masterclass in movie storytelling, a dynamic testament to the sheer, invigorating uniqueness of cinema.\n",
        "Sergio Leone's epic looks good, almost great, restored to its original running time.\n",
        "Of all the great films of the 1960s, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is one of a fistful that can be truly appreciated only on the big screen.\n",
        "Leone's blockbuster is balanced on the razor's edge between popular entertainment and art film. It took classic American themes and turned them inside out.\n",
        "This is a great movie, whatever strange estuary of the western river it occupies.\n",
        "An improbable masterpiece -- a bizarre mixture of grandly operatic visuals, grim brutality and sordid violence that keeps wrenching you from one extreme to the other.\n",
        "Art it is, summoned out of the imagination of Leone and painted on the wide screen so vividly that we forget what marginal productions these films were.\n",
        "The uncut new print reclaims the widescreen majesty of Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography, allowing you to see every iconic wart and furrow on every bad guy's face.\n",
        "It's great to see a great director's film as he intended it, with rich color and restored sound.\n",
        "All told, and in giant widescreen, it's only blood-red adolescent fun, but it blooms like Douglas Sirk with a Gatling gun compared to the teenage demographic's current fare.\n",
        "Set in 1969 England, it portrays the last throes of a friendship mirroring the seedy demise of the hippie period, delivering some comic gems along the way.\n",
        "A biting script from writer-director Bruce Robinson and performances from Richard E Grant and Paul McGann as two 'resting' actors, Withnail and 'I', that neither has surpassed.\n",
        "Too few films take on the art of arguing as a subject; we could certainly use more of them, but until then, Lumet's window into strained civic duty will continue to serve mightily.\n",
        "The film leaves a tremendous impact.\n",
        "Mechanically written, but within its own middlebrow limitations, it delivers the goods.\n",
        "A strangely realistic thriller.\n",
        "Although it may sound ungallant, these 12 Angry Men, are all right without distaff glamour. Their dramas are powerful and provocative enough to keep a viewer spellbound.\n",
        "This is a film where tension comes from personality conflict, dialogue and body language, not action.\n",
        "It is O'Toole who continually dominates the screen, and he dominates it with professional skill, Irish charm and smashing good looks.\n",
        "It was a big bold project and has turned out a big bold film.\n",
        "[It] remains one of the most intelligent, handsome, and influential of all war epics.\n",
        "The passage of time has only proved how difficult it is to run ideas, history, characterisation and landscape in harness on this sort of scale.\n",
        "Approach it from whatever angle you like, performances, script, cinematography, score; David Lean's sweeping biography of T.E. Lawrence is unarguably magnificent.\n",
        "Even the flies in the opening Cairo scene jump out at you.\n",
        "It reduces a legendary figure to conventional movie-hero size amidst magnificent and exotic scenery but a conventional lot of action-film cliches.\n",
        "An epic achievement in filmmaking.\n",
        "A cracking good adventure yarn, as well as a disturbing psychological profile of a man destined to become a great leader but an even greater dupe.\n",
        "It's an astonishing, unrepeatable epic.\n",
        "Riveting from beginning to end, featuring stellar performances, amazing cinematography, and a story without a trace of fat, the film does everything an epic is supposed to do -- and more.\n",
        "Lawrence is too emotionally overpowering for critical reservations.\n",
        "The only thing that really dates it is the awful makeup, orangey pancake for Lawrence, a gray-green nose for Quinn and cordovan shoe polish for Guinness.\n",
        "We remember the quiet, empty passages, the sun rising across the desert, the intricate lines traced by the wind in the sand.\n",
        "This is that rare film whose weaknesses are not only swallowed up by its vast, disturbing ambition, but somehow become part of its strengths.\n",
        "Lawrence luxuriates in the tremendous.\n",
        "To Kill a Mockingbird is a time capsule, preserving hopes and sentiments from a kinder, gentler, more naive America.\n",
        "Harper Lee's child's-eye view of southern bigotry gains something in its translation to the screen by Robert Mulligan, who knows exactly where to place the camera to catch a child's subjective experience.\n",
        "This one is always just off the boil.\n",
        "Minor shortcomings in a rewarding film.\n",
        "Universally recognized as a classic, and the label is well deserved.\n",
        "Harper Lee's highly regarded first novel has been artfully and delicately translated to the screen.\n",
        "A film of pure sensation, dazzling audiences with light and noise, laying bare the stark horror - and unimaginable thrill - of combat.\n",
        "Alternately a brilliant and bizarre film, Francis Coppola's four year 'work in progress' offers the definitive validation to the old saw, 'war is hell.'\n",
        "...it's wonderful to see this hallucinatory folly-cum-near masterpiece again on the big screen.\n",
        "Apocalypse Now did help provide me, and many of my generation, with a vision of what film art could achieve, a vision so magnificent it doomed us to spend much of our subsequent moviegoing lives in a funk.\n",
        "...Coppola's sprawling, harrowing war story is not to be missed.\n",
        "Apocalypse Now is a mixed bag, a product of excess and ambition, hatched in agony and redeemed by shards of brilliance.\n",
        "The opening, with the whirling sound of choppers intercut with Willard sweating angst in his Saigon hotel bed, a jungle burning with napalm...remains a visual and aural wonder.\n",
        "What the excitement was about was the unspoken belief that this film would put a cap on the most exciting decade in American film, that it would sum up everything that had come before and influence everything that came after...\n",
        "...the movie still has the power to floor you with its stunning sounds and imagery.\n",
        "As technically complex and masterful as any war film I can remember.\n",
        "There are worse ways to make movies, but there are a lot of better ones too.\n",
        "The film has one of the most haunting endings in cinema, a poetic evocation of what Kurtz has discovered, and what we hope not to discover for ourselves.\n",
        "There is something touching and maniacal about the two-and-three-quarter- hour result.\n",
        "'Once Upon a Time...' now looks like an over-cooked mess of style, metaphor and reference.\n",
        "The Western is dead - or so they tell us. Long live Leone's timeless monument to the death of the West itself, rivalled only by Peckinpah's Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid for the title of best ever made.\n",
        "Leone (1921-1989) is here at the peak of his epic powers.\n",
        "If only the first 10 minutes of Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West still existed, this most hyperbolic of oat operas would still be acknowledged as one of the genre's greatest exhumations.\n",
        "It is mostly fun for the way it cherishes movie styles and attitudes from the past.\n",
        "The movie stretches on for nearly three hours, with intermission, and provides two false alarms before it finally ends.\n",
        "One of the greatest face movies ever made.\n",
        "It is not as exciting as Star Wars itself, which had the advantage of novelty. But it is better and more satisfying than The Empire Strikes Back...\n",
        "Reasonably fast paced for its 133-minute length, a visual treat throughout.\n",
        "With its feints at horror and pathos, the third Star Wars film is the most Disney-esque in its emotional outline, yet that outline is buried beneath an obnoxiously hyped-up pace that reduces the emotions to rubble.\n",
        "In scope and ambition, Jediresembles nothing so much as the next level of a computer game, with a new environment, new gadgets and new creatures.\n",
        "Though it looks almost too polished, a handful of eye-smacking action scenes were breakthroughs in precomputer cinematic graphics. And when the film moves, it does so with blazing energy and awesome noise.\n",
        "Jedi may not be George Lucas's crown jewel, but his trilogy as a whole is as good as film fantasy gets.\n",
        "The old Star Wars gang are back doing what they've done before, but this time with a certain evident boredom.\n",
        "Marvelous!\n",
        "Jedi couldn't end the Star Wars trilogy on a happier note!\n",
        "Mark Hamill is particularly good in this film.\n",
        "The acting in Return of the Jedi is stronger than in the previous films.\n",
        "Let's not pretend we're watching art!\n",
        "Jedi is downright repetitive!\n",
        "A mediocre Star Wars is better than no Star Wars at all.\n",
        "The film is a huge, rousing finale that resolves all plot twists, settles all accounts, reunites old friends and sweeps to a climax that all but blows the theater apart!\n",
        "A fantasy that... goes right in spite of its solemn style.\n",
        "A sublimely beautiful, deeply romantic film for our times.\n",
        "Wings of Desire is one of Wenders's most stunning achievements.\n",
        "Few films are so rich, so intriguing, or so ambitious.\n",
        "One of the few truly great movies to come out of the '80s.\n",
        "Startlingly original at first, Wings of Desire is in the end damagingly overloaded.\n",
        "The film evokes a mood of reverie, elegy and meditation.\n",
        "Underneath its melancholia and mind-boggling, even bothersome metaphysics, it's the simplest (well, almost) story ever told -- angel meets girl, angel gets girl.\n",
        "a soaring vision that appeals to the senses and the spirit\n",
        "It transformed the way I looked at the world.\n",
        "Welles gives Harry a mask of irony that turns all moral judgment back on itself. He turns a mass murderer into a wry rogue, and makes his villainy all the more horrifying because we rather like him.\n",
        "Seen today, The Third Man ... can be appreciated as a prophetic statement on the eventual moral bankruptcy of the one-world euphoria that clouded men's minds immediately after the second 'war to end all wars.'\n",
        "Top credit must go to Mr. Reed for molding all possible elements into a thriller of superconsequence.\n",
        "For lovers of film noir, The Third Man is unquestionably a must-see -- one of the masterpieces of a genre that has contained everything from milestone motion pictures to low-budget potboilers.\n",
        "The Third Man is like the exhausted aftermath of Casablanca.\n",
        "a full-blooded, absorbing story\n",
        "One of the glories of postwar cinema, and quite possibly one of the most sheerly enjoyable movies ever made.\n",
        "It seemed like the creation of a sensibility terribly old and wise, and most of all very European; it was the very essence of world-weary sophistication.\n",
        "However hoked-up and self-regarding, The Third Man ... remains an indelible experience.\n",
        "The complete effect of The Third Man is of superficial mysteries wrapped around deeper mysteries of the human heart, all immersed in a desperate universe suspended by the silent witnessing of a thousand eyes.\n",
        "Wonderful entertainment.\n",
        "Of all the movies I have seen, this one most completely embodies the romance of going to the movies.\n",
        "All of the performances are first-rate; Pesci stands out, though, with his seemingly unscripted manner. GoodFellas is easily one of the year`s best films.\n",
        "GoodFellas, which somehow mixes its horrors with a deep vein of mordant humor, flows with the exuberance of a filmmaker who has every detail nailed and a few new lovely moves he wants to show us.\n",
        "Spanning thirty years and running two and a half hours, the film bristles with the violent passion, howitzer wit and virtuoso style that made Scorsese's reputation with the gangster drama Mean Streets in 1973.\n",
        "In GoodFellas, Scorsese, that connoisseur of mean streets and brutish, reflexive rage, has fashioned a stunning film that belongs on the same lonely, top shelf as Coppola's Mafia saga.\n",
        "Robert De Niro gives what has come to be a typical Robert De Niro performance -- understated, sly, ingratiating. Joe Pesci, as the hot-tempered Tommy, steals several scenes from his fellow performers.\n",
        "The most profoundly Catholic of contemporary filmmakers, Scorsese has here imagined a world without the slightest notion of sin-everything is permitted, and he is both fascinated and appalled by the total freedom of his characters.\n",
        "In GoodFellas, director Martin Scorsese does something simple and audacious: He takes the guilt out of organized crime.\n",
        "You walk away, tantalized by a view into the darkest part of yourself, glad that that part is still behind bars.\n",
        "Colorful but dramatically unsatisfying.\n",
        "May well be the most accomplished thing Scorsese's ever done.\n",
        "Scorsese's fast, violent, stylish mobster movie is a return to form.\n",
        "Goodfellas looks and sounds as if it must be absolutely authentic.\n",
        "It is not a coincidence that Scorsese's three masterpieces all star Robert De Niro.\n",
        "GoodFellas is an appalling masterpiece of the kind that, along with New York's current well-publicized troubles, is likely to give pause to anyone planning to make a trip to the city.\n",
        "No finer film has ever been made about organized crime.\n",
        "The performances by everyone are stunning, standout.\n",
        "The most startling thing watching Alien again is its pacing. For the first 45 minutes, little happens. It's all slow, exquisite build-up, which makes the second half seem all the more horrific.\n",
        "It is depressing to watch an expensive, crafty movie that never soars beyond its cold desire to score the big bucks.\n",
        "The limited strengths of its staple sci-fi horrors always derived from either the offhand organic/ Freudian resonances of its design or the purely (brilliantly) manipulative editing and pacing of its above-average shock quota.\n",
        "An old-fashioned scary movie set in a highly realistic sci-fi future, made all the more believable by expert technical craftmanship.\n",
        "An empty-headed horror movie with nothing to recommend it beyond the disco-inspired art direction and some handsome, if gimmicky, cinematography.\n",
        "The limited strengths of its staple sci-fi horrors always derived from either the offhand organic/ Freudian resonances of its design or the purely (brilliantly) manipulative editing and pacing of its above-average shock quota.\n",
        "A genuine fright classic.\n",
        "These things no longer surprise or tantalize us as they once did. In a very short time, science-fiction films have developed their own jargon that's now become a part of the grammar.\n",
        "Alien will upset your mind and upset your stomach.\n",
        "Alien looks amazing, almost like a new film.\n",
        "Ridley Scott's new cut won't change the way people think about the movie, but it reinforces the film's strengths without alienating the series' biggest fans.\n",
        "Ridley Scott's 1979 movie is a great original.\n",
        "It's a most satisfying return to one of the few sci-fi films that deserves to be called a masterpiece.\n",
        "Besides Weaver and Skeritt, the top-notch ensemble includes two of Britain's best actors -- Ian Holm, as the untrustworthy science officer, and John Hurt.\n",
        "What's most unusual about the original 24 years later, though, is its elegant minimalism.\n",
        "It's a scream from another era that still echoes around us.\n",
        "A haunted-house movie set in space, Alien also has a profoundly existentialist undertow that makes it feel like a film noir -- the other genre to feature a slithery, sexualized monster as its classic villain.\n",
        "The way [Ridley] Scott meticulously raises the sense of menace and tension is worthy of Hitchcock.\n",
        "In space, the famous tagline went, no one can hear you scream. In Alien, you can hear lessons for the sci-fi future in a great milestone from the recent past.\n",
        "This is old-fashioned fun until the climactic battle, which almost comes across like routine bone piling after all the flights of fancy.\n",
        "Ran is one of the cinema's greatest works, a film of true tragic vision.\n",
        "One of the supreme cinematic achievements of the last quarter-century.\n",
        "Less a director's return to form than an essay in solipsism and self-pity run amok.\n",
        "Ultimately it is this mixture of the grand gesture and the fine touch, the big world and the small people who occupy it, that lingers with us long after Ran is over.\n",
        "By the time Kurosawa's camera comes to rest on the film's final, poignant image, a painting of the Buddha that one character had promised another would protect him from harm, the movie seemingly has accomplished the impossible: one-upping Shakespeare.\n",
        "There's probably more carnage in Ran than there is in Rambo and The Terminator combined, but the new film substitutes intelligence and emotion for mindlessness and emotionalism. You leave the theater awestruck, not dumbstruck.\n",
        "What could be more exciting than the prospect of one of the giants of world cinema, his career resuscitated, adapting Shakespeare's most modern play?\n",
        "What's remarkable about Ran is that the drama enhances the spectacle the same way the spectacle bolsters the drama. Few other directors had Kurosawa's ability to convey the intimate as well as the epic, to handle stillness as well as violence.\n",
        "Those who were suspicious of the filmmaker's unambiguous plotting and Westernized approach had to admit to its daunting grandeur.\n",
        "Like all of Kurosawa's work, the human pulse is what drives the drama. Only this time, it's also the drumbeat of an elegy.\n",
        "It is a film that already belongs to the ages.\n",
        "For aficionados of the war movie, the western, and the period action epic, Ran is necessary viewing.\n",
        "At age 75, the director has made his most costly epic to date, and it's a dazzlingly successful addition to his distinguished career.\n",
        "Akira Kurosawa's 1985 film is slightly marred by some too obvious straining toward masterpiece status, yet it's a stunning achievement in epic cinema.\n",
        "The shift and sway of a nation divided is vast, the chaos terrible, the battle scenes the most ghastly ever filmed, and the outcome is even bleaker than Shakespeare's.\n",
        "Kurosawa dares to edit Shakespeare's story lines, adding back stories and deleting major characters, but the motivations and emotions remain true.\n",
        "A film of the sort of grandeur that brings to mind Griffith's Birth of a Nation, Napoleon Vu par Abel Gance and Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible.\n",
        "List any element -- from concept through cinematography, battle action, editing, acting, sound, music, costumes or whatever, right down to makeup -- and Kurosawa's commitment is total.\n",
        "It has become a cliche to call Kurosawa the world's greatest living filmmaker.\n",
        "Nobody can film an epic battle scene like Kurosawa.\n",
        "A lot of claims have been made for this campy bloodbath concerto by Hong Kong director John Woo, and I must admit that he's even better than Brian De Palma at delivering emotional and visceral excess with staccato relentlessness.\n",
        "The director repeatedly places the viewer at the center of the crossfire and turns the gyrating camera into the next best thing to a lethal weapon.\n",
        "The most dementedly elegiac thriller you've ever seen.\n",
        "This is a rush of a movie.\n",
        "Hitchcock is the most-daring avant-garde film-maker in America today.\n",
        "The best that can be said is there are bats in the belfry and a well-preserved corpse in the basement. What else can one do but scream?\n",
        "It blazed a bloody trail for the much-loved slasher cycle, but it also assured us that a B-movie could be A-grade in quality and innovation.\n",
        "Director Hitchcock bears down too heavily in this one, and the delicate illusion of reality necessary for a creak-and-shriek movie becomes, instead, a spectacle of stomach-churning horror.\n",
        "An unusual, good entertainment, indelibly Hitchcock, and on the right kind of boxoffice beam.\n",
        "Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 masterpiece blends a brutal manipulation of audience identification and an incredibly dense, allusive visual style to create the most morally unsettling film ever made.\n",
        "All those who still get a chill every time they step into a hotel shower, say aye. That, you see, is the power of Psycho.\n",
        "What makes Psycho immortal, when so many films are already half-forgotten as we leave the theater, is that it connects directly with our fears.\n",
        "[Hitchcock] has very shrewdly interwoven crime, sex and suspense, blended the real and the unreal in fascinating proportions and punctuated his film with several quick, grisly and unnerving surprises.\n",
        "With the exception of Halloween, no latter-day horror/thriller has been capable of generating as many goosebumps.\n",
        "[Hitchcock's] denouement falls quite flat for us. But the acting is fair.\n",
        "The film retains a huge nostalgic kick, thanks in large part to Aykroyd and Belushi's easy rapport, a smattering of daft, shaggy humour and some truly iconic musical sequences.\n",
        "A demolition symphony that works with the cold efficiency of a Moog synthesizer gone sadistic.\n",
        "Given all the chaos, director and, with Aykroyd, cowriter, John Landis manages to keep things reasonably controlled and in a straight line.\n",
        "The humor is predicated on underplaying in overscaled situations, which is sporadically funny in a Keaton-esque way but soon sputters out through sheer, uninspired repetition.\n",
        "There's even room, in the midst of the carnage and mayhem, for a surprising amount of grace, humor, and whimsy.\n",
        "This essentially modest movie is reported to have cost about $30 million, and what did all that money buy? Scores of car crashes. Too many extras. Overstaged dance numbers. And a hollowness that certainly didn't come cheap.\n",
        "One of the most ambitious and brilliantly executed American films, a landmark work from one of Hollywood's top cinema eras.\n",
        "Not once does Pacino overtly ask for the audience's sympathy, but through a disciplined, suggestive performance he dominates the film.\n",
        "The Paramount release has everything going for it.\n",
        "Francis Ford Coppola pulls it off in grand style.\n",
        "The performances, Gordon Willis' memorably gloomy camerawork, the stately pace and the sheer scale of the story's sweep render everything engrossing and so, well, plausible that our ideas of organised crime in America will forever be marked by this movie.\n",
        "The stunning text of The Godfather is replaced in Part II with prologues, epilogues, footnotes, and good intentions.\n",
        "It's a second movie made largely out of the bits and pieces of Mr. Puzo's novel that didn't fit into the first. It's a Frankenstein's monster stitched together from leftover parts. It talks. It moves in fits and starts but it has no mind of its own.\n",
        "Few sequels have expanded upon the original with the faithfulness and detail of this one.\n",
        "If his considerable achievement in this long- awaited film falls short of his Olympian standards, there is a reason that ought to give Kubrick some satisfaction. The world has caught up with Kubrick and what he has to say.\n",
        "It may seem too spare, too clinical, its moments of war even too familiar for some. But, aiming for minds as well as hearts, Kubrick hits his target squarely.\n",
        "What gives this story its power is not really its originality, but the relentlessness of Kubrick's black-comic vision and the tightness of his focus.\n",
        "There is a real fear at the heart of this monstrously armored, desperately defensive film.\n",
        "It's a great piece of filmmaking, diminished only by a second act that fails to live up to the first act of the Marines in training.\n",
        "Full Metal Jacket is not a realistic film -- it is horror-comic superrealism, from a God's-eye view -- but it should fully engage the ordinary movie grunt.\n",
        "This is the most tightly crafted Kubrick film since Dr. Strangelove, as well as the most horrific; the first section alone accomplishes most of what The Shining failed to do.\n",
        "An intense, schematic, superbly made Vietnam War drama.\n",
        "Kubrick's direction is as steely cold and manipulative as the regime it depicts, and we never really get to know, let alone care about, the hapless recruits on view.\n",
        "Although the elements of the story are simple and precise, Kubrick infuses a dreamlike, fatalistic quality.\n",
        "Full Metal Jacket, ice and wildfire, order and chaos, is intellectual war, hard thought.\n",
        "No one who sees Full Metal Jacket will easily put the film's last glimpse of D'Onofrio, or a great many other things about Kubrick's latest and most sobering vision, out of mind.\n",
        "[A] strangely shapeless film from the man whose work usually imposes a ferociously consistent vision on his material.\n",
        "Kubrick's harrowing, beautiful and characteristically eccentric new film about Vietnam, is going to puzzle, anger and (I hope) fascinate audiences as much as any film he has made to date.\n",
        "A stirring, gritty and enjoyable pic which offers a plethora of fine performances from some of the U.K.'s brightest talents.\n",
        "The cast -- including Derek Jacobi as the modern-dress chorus, Paul Scofield, Judi Dench, Ian Holm, Emma Thompson, and Robbie Coltrane in an effective cameo as Falstaff -- is uniformly fine without any grandstanding.\n",
        "Branagh succeeds in his blunt, robust portrayal of the Soldier-King, hauling the film along in the wake of his own gung-ho performance.\n",
        "Mr. Branagh's Henry has psychological heft and intellectual weight.\n",
        "More questioning, more agonized, finally more humble.\n",
        "Everything about this remarkable production is exhilaratingly unexpected.\n",
        "What works best in the film is the over-all vision.\n",
        "In this alert, rousing interpretation of Henry V, Branagh beats down the doors of high art and drags the sleeping bard into the light of modern day.\n",
        "The performance of Abraham, who won the Best Actor Oscar for it, is monumental, and so is Forman's direction.\n",
        "The subject of artistic creation is typically handled badly in the movies.... [Amadeus] treats the subject of creativity in a fresh way.\n",
        "A grand movie entertainment.\n",
        "On a production level and as an evocation of a time and place, Amadeus is loaded with pleasures.\n",
        "Peter Shaffer's shrewdly orchestrated cultural evening gets a steady, dignified, moderately dull treatment from Milos Forman.\n",
        "The entire cast speaks in horribly intrusive American accents, but Forman makes some perceptive connections between Mozart's life and work.\n",
        "It is arguably the best motion picture ever made about the process of creation and the creator.\n",
        "As Mozart, Tom Hulce, though extremely American in looks and voice, gets better and better as the drama progresses.\n",
        "This dark, exuberant epic is nearly 18 years old, yet remains the most popularly successful film ever to render the inner life of an artist.\n",
        "Reminds us that movies can be lyrical as well as vulgar, ambitious as well as playful, brilliant as well as down and dirty -- just like Amadeus himself.\n",
        "Remains a beautiful, deftly directed and superbly acted version of a witty and poignant drama.\n",
        "In a film of grand gestures, some of the finest moments are very subtle.\n",
        "A gloriously colorful confection of music, theater and emotion.\n",
        "It's got more music, more drama, more of what made it a big winner with audiences and critics 18 years ago.\n",
        "Like the composers the film so wondrously depicts, Amadeus: Director's Cut is a divine work in need of a little earthly restraint.\n",
        "In any incarnation, Amadeus is beautiful to behold.\n",
        "The principal additions ... are more Amadeus, but not better.\n",
        "Still a work of consummate artistry and craftsmanship.\n",
        "This is a robust romantic drama of a native-born's return to Ireland. Director John Ford took cast and cameras to Ireland to tell the story [by Maurice Walsh] against actual backgrounds.\n",
        "John Ford's 1952 Oscar winner is a tribute to an Ireland that exists only in the imaginations of songwriters and poets like Ford.\n",
        "The illusion/reality theme underlying immigrant boxer Wayne's return from America to County Galway is soon swamped within a vibrant community of stage-Irish 'types'.\n",
        "Let's face it. Mr. Ford is in love with Ireland, as is his cast, and they give us a fine, gay time while they're about it.\n",
        "Although not a true classic, The Quiet Man is worth more than a cursory glance, especially for those who like Wayne or would like to experience more of his work.\n",
        "Sergio Leone's languid, lovely and lengthy ode to Lower East Side mobsters (more specifically, mobster films) ...\n",
        "Leone is less interested in arousing an audience's easier emotions than in presenting, at a dispassionate distance, the horror of two men warily walking toward each other on a tightrope suspended above the snake pit of their , deepest compulsions.\n",
        "Every gesture is immediate, and every gesture seems eternal.\n",
        "A disappointment of considerable proportions.\n",
        "While Leone's vision still has a magnificent sweep, the film finally subsides to an emotional core that is sombre, even elegiac, and which centres on a man who is bent and broken by time, and finally left with nothing but an impotent sadness.\n",
        "There are times when we don't understand exactly what is happening, but never a time when we don't feel confidence in the film's narrative.\n",
        "As one would expect from Leone, the film is a brilliant stylistic accomplishment.\n",
        "A lazily haullucinatory epic that means to encapsulate approximately 50 years of American social history into a single film.\n",
        "The film slips easily back and forth in time, dancing between the decades, often making the connection from one era to another solely by means of brilliant cuts that work like magic.\n",
        "Seeing what Leone always intended is like getting your dirty glasses washed.\n",
        "When has a performer as fully and uniquely sacrificed himself to the moving-picture cause as De Niro?\n",
        "De Niro is always absorbing and credible, even when his character isn't.\n",
        "Martin Scorsese makes pictures about the kinds of people you wouldn't want to know.\n",
        "I can't pan it, but this 1980 fantasy biography of fighter Jake LaMotta seems unquestionably Martin Scorsese's weakest work, at least to that point in his career.\n",
        "This film does more than make you think about masculinity, it makes you see it -- in a way that's relevant to all men, not just Bronx boxers.\n",
        "The film that many consider the finest of its decade.\n",
        "An underdog in its day and a classic today.\n",
        "Though Raging Bull has only three principal characters, it is a big film, its territory being the landscape of the soul.\n",
        "The most obvious basis for the film's claim to greatness lies in Scorsese's devastating critique of the very codes of masculinity that shaped him as a filmmaker, and in Robert De Niro's performance, through which that critique is made flesh.\n",
        "It's the best film I've seen about the low self-esteem, sexual inadequacy and fear that lead some men to abuse women.\n",
        "There's no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas. During fight sequences, the director also uses a number of point-of-view shots designed to show the world, however briefly, from La Motta's perspective.\n",
        "Allen joins the Catskills tummler's anything-for-a-laugh antics with a Eurocentric art-house self-awareness and a psychoanalytic obsession in baring his sexual desires and frustrations, romantic disasters, and neurotic inhibitions.\n",
        "This is the link between Allen's \"earlier, funnier\" stuff and more probing works like Interiors and Manhattan. Would that we all could build such masterful bridges.\n",
        "Personal as the story he is telling may be, what separates this film from Allen's own past work and most other recent comedy is its general believability.\n",
        "A touching and hilarious love story that is Allen's most three-dimensional film to date.\n",
        "Visually and structurally it's a mess, but many of the situations are genuinely clever, and there are plenty of memorable gags.\n",
        "If you can forgive the fact that it's a ragbag of half-digested intellectual ideas dressed up with trendy intellectual references, you should have a good laugh.\n",
        "There will be discussion about what points in the film coincide with the lives of its two stars, but this, I think, is to detract from and trivialize the achievement of the film, which, at last, puts Woody in the league with the best directors we have.\n",
        "Watching it again, 25 years after its April 1977 premiere, I am astonished by how scene after scene has an instant familiarity.\n",
        "Tarkovsky realizes the allegorical tale with an overwhelming density of visual detail ...\n",
        "Not an easy film, but almost certainly a great one.\n",
        "Tarkovsky conjures images like you've never seen before; and as a journey to the heart of darkness, it's a good deal more persuasive than Coppola's.\n",
        "Stalker, a somber futuristic fantasy from the Soviet Union, attempts to build an apocalyptic vision out of the most impoverished materials imaginable.\n",
        "Everything described in the film is authentic.\n",
        "The film has no qualities beyond its formal polish.\n",
        "Agripping, impressively detailed account of one harrowing voyage by a German U-boat during World War II.\n",
        "Petersen's shooting style displays a breathtaking, if impersonal and faintly academic, virtuosity comparable to that of Lean or Coppola.\n",
        "Das Boot is yet another moving testament to the wastefulness of battle.\n",
        "The film reaches right out to grab us by the neck and squeeze hard.\n",
        "Wolfgang Petersen's direction is an exercise in pure craftsmanship.\n",
        "This film takes all of the drama and suspense inherent in a submarine-based story and delivers it in a near- perfect package, establishing Das Boot as not just a terrific adrenaline rush, but one of the best movies ever made.\n",
        "You're drawn in powerfully as the crew members experience a psychologically maddening cycle of lull and storm.\n",
        "Suspenseful when it needs to be and intelligent in its depiction of the horrors of war and the sweaty claustrophobia of submarine life. On occasion, it's even -- pardon the pun -- deep.\n",
        "Newman and Redford pass a few facial expressions between them and try to cool each other out. If there ever was much of a script, it can be said to have gone to waste.\n",
        "Extremely handsome production values and a great supporting cast round out the virtues.\n",
        "Top-notch entertainment.\n",
        "The film ends up relying on different chapter headings to explain what's going on, but it's all very professional, with fine attention to period detail.\n",
        "The film is so good-natured, so obviously aware of everything it's up to, even its own picturesque frauds, that I opt to go along with it.\n",
        "The movie has a nice, light-fingered style to it.\n",
        "The fact that [it] isn't very funny and, like its 80-year-old heroic, long outlives its necessary life, is less important than the fact that the characters frequently react gently or like credible human beings to the script's impossible notions.\n",
        "Simpleminded, but it's fairly inoffensive, at least until Ashby lingers over the concentration-camp serial number tattooed on Gordon's arm. Some things are beyond the reach of whimsy.\n",
        "It is most successful when it keeps to the tone of an insane fairystory set up at the beginning of the movie.\n",
        "[Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon] both are so aggressive, so creepy and off-putting.\n",
        "The visual style makes everyone look fresh from the Wax Museum, and all the movie lacks is a lot of day-old gardenias and lilies and roses in the lobby, filling the place with a cloying sweet smell. Nothing more to report today.\n",
        "Marked by a few good gags, but marred by a greater preponderance of sophomoric, overdone and mocking humor.\n",
        "I saw this at a festival and hated it, then sat through it again a year later and decided it wasn't so bad, aside from the god-awful ending.\n",
        "It's a pity, because few romcoms pull off the basically sympathetic mining of personal vanities and social embarrassment that the film manages in its opening hour.\n",
        "Freundlich's outstanding cast (including Garry Shandling, Eva Mendes, Ellen Barkin, Bob Balaban and James LeGros) -- his best since 1997's The Myth of Fingerprints -- glosses over miscalculations with sheer star power.\n",
        "Two couples in trouble, one with kids, another considering them. Writer-director Bart Freundlich's challenge is to stress them and find a resolution to their conflicts in ways that aren't banal, predictable or witless. And he settles for one out of three.\n",
        "The fact that Freundlich tries to put some thoughtful commentary into a formulaic story is commendable, but in the end either his faith wavers or the studio intervened.\n",
        "I wish the film were true to itself and its quartet of puzzled, struggling lovers; their collapse into sitcom idiocy felt uncomfortably close to betrayal.\n",
        "A lot more smug and a lot less insightful than writer-director Bart Freundlich apparently assumes, and it's burdened even more by its surfeit of unsympathetic characters.\n",
        "Screenwriter and director Bart Freundlich fails to offer fresh insights into the problems of contemporary relationships, and many of his comic targets are easy and conventional.\n",
        "There's nothing terribly wrong with this comedy about the romantic dalliances of four New Yorkers, but there's nothing terribly right about it, either.\n",
        "The people behind this film would not recognize complex, honest emotion if it hit them in the face with a frying pan.\n",
        "Trying to mimic the Woody Allen films is not a bad thing to do, but why not put a spin on it?\n",
        "Is this farce, drama, satire? Who knows?\n",
        "This comedy about two self-absorbed New York couples feels like wan Woody Allen.\n",
        "Trust the Man has a sketchy overall feel, as if Freundlich didn't finish thinking it through.\n",
        "Trust the Man is a mildly amusing movie, but that's chiefly a result of its stars -- or, more specifically, its female stars -- elevating the material.\n",
        "As faux Woody Allen movies go, Trust the Man is one of the more diverting recent entries in the genre, with a top-drawer cast, well-chosen Manhattan locations and a sharper script than Allen himself has managed in a while.\n",
        "In the end, you're left feeling a little empty, as if you've been eavesdropping on a conversation in a restaurant and neglected to eat your dinner.\n",
        "The actors gamely keep up their spirits, but the male characters are too one-dimensional and the female characters too bizarrely divorced from reality to be at all engaging.\n",
        "Bergman's visually striking medieval morality play [was] the work that gained him an international reputation.\n",
        "Film has superior technical narrative, impressive lensing and thesping.\n",
        "Its view of a seemingly godless landscape in the grip of plague is still bold and frightening.\n",
        "It survives today only as an unusually pure example of a typical 50s art-film strategy: the attempt to make the most modern and most popular of art forms acceptable to the intelligentsia by forcing it into an arcane, antique mold.\n",
        "Not only highly impressive but thought-provoking, relevant and intensely moving in our present, nervous, times.\n",
        "Essentially intellectual, yet emotionally stimulating, too, it is as tough -- and rewarding -- a screen challenge as the moviegoer has had to face this year.\n",
        "This is an uncompromising film, regarding good and evil with the same simplicity and faith as its hero.\n",
        "The thematics are rather cloying, but the mood -- profoundly relaxed, bemused -- eventually conquers.\n",
        "[It's] loaded with wry, offbeat humor and is the sort of satisfying, personal picture that is becoming an increasingly rare commodity these days\n",
        "Forsyth cannot quite tease out of his characters the kind of strange sublety that Powell and Pressburger delivered, but it is enough that he and producer David Puttnam succeed in making you realise just how badly this kind of film has been missed.\n",
        "Here is a small film to treasure, a loving, funny, understated portrait of a small Scottish town and its encounter with a giant oil company.\n",
        "It demonstrates Mr. Forsyth's uncanny ability for making an audience sense that something magical is going on, even if that something isn't easily explained.\n",
        "It brings me very little joy to report that this version of the popular Terminator franchise is silly, obtuse, and pointless.\n",
        "A shambolic, deafening, intelligence-insulting mess, a crushing failure on almost all counts.\n",
        "This is the worst big budget summer release I've seen in some time.\n",
        "It's a fun time at the movies.\n",
        "Terminator Salvation is a confused, humorless grind, with nobody, from the stars to the set designers, prepared to prick its self-importance.\n",
        "The digital effects are mostly quite dazzling-not just the depictions of towering marauders...but a memorably scary sequence in which a little serpentine robot that's been taken captive thrashes furiously to save its nonlife.\n",
        "T4 is a mixed bag, but it's not f------- amateur.\n",
        "Message to Hollywood: Stop with the time-travel stuff.\n",
        "McG, a music video maven whose previous credits include the Charlie's Angels movies, directs the action passably well.\n",
        "Intensity need not be the enemy of personality, but in Bale's work it too often has been.\n",
        "\"Terminator Salvation\" promised moviegoers a war between the human heart and the cold, cruel efficiency of machines. So why then is it so mechanical itself, so good at repetition, so preprogrammed and clunky?\n",
        "A good summer movie isn't just an uninterrupted crescendo of cacophony. You need stuff in between the fireballs and the cyborgs.\n",
        "Terminator Salvation is so programmed, so impersonal, that it practically dares you to warm to its characters.\n",
        "One could argue Connor's grim demeanor is precisely what a global disaster demands. But Bale's turn has a bass-note feel that is anti-charismatic.\n",
        "The movie's only unmitigated pleasure is a too-brief fight scene between Connor and a naked combatant made up to look precisely like Arnold Schwarzenegger, the relentless cyborg of the first three installments.\n",
        "The latest installment in the venerable sci-fi action franchise turns out to be a straight-up war film, grim and muscular and thundering and joyless. It's the color of cement, and it weighs as much, too.\n",
        "The Terminator franchise was built on thrills, imagination, narrative, emotion, believability, character development and watchability. Terminator Salvation has plenty of thrills.\n",
        "Too bad Schwarzenegger is otherwise occupied these days.\n",
        "Skynet may not have ensured its own future, yet. But their robots have clearly made serious inroads in our movies.\n",
        "The best to date from Kiwi gore specialist Peter Jackson.\n",
        "The finale, in which Lionel reduces a horde of flesh-eaters to a mulch of blood, flesh and offal with the aid of a flymo, is probably the goriest scene ever.\n",
        "Because all of this looks blatantly unreal, and because the timing of the shock effects is so haphazard, Dead Alive isn't especially scary or repulsive. Nor is it very funny.\n",
        "Horror films used to be primordial spook shows, tapping midnight-dark fears. Now they tap bodily goo: rivers of blood, dripping limbs, eyeballs that go pop in the night.\n",
        "It is the movie's often awesome imagery and a bravely soaring choral score by James Horner that transfigure the reality, granting it the status of necessary myth.\n",
        "A stirring and long overdue tribute to the black soldiers who fought for the Union cause in the Civil War.\n",
        "A pretty watchable and always interesting period film, well photographed by English cinematographer Freddie Francis.\n",
        "The stark clarity of Freddie Francis' cinematography combined with Zwick's intimate style evokes immediacy and fear.\n",
        "This is a good, moving, complicated film.\n",
        "Glory is, without question, one of the best movies ever made about the American Civil War.\n",
        "Matthew Broderick [is] catastrophically miscast as Shaw.\n",
        "A strong and valuable film.\n",
        "It's hard not to get carried along.\n",
        "Generally engrossing and always well-acted.\n",
        "Both Oldman and Roth turn in flat and uninspiring performances.\n",
        "As happens at the opera, one usually laughs (if one laughs at all) not because something is funny, but because one has successfully recognized that it is supposed to be funny.\n",
        "As a movie, this material, freely adapted by Stoppard, is boring and endless. It lies flat on the screen, hardly stirring.\n",
        "Staged as they are here, the jokes and the fourth-wall gamesmanship don't seem as funny as they did on the page.\n",
        "The film should not come as a complete surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to Allen's doings lately. This is the movie that Annie Hall hinted at and to which last year's Interiors, flawed as it was, seems to have served as a necessary prelude.\n",
        "Allen serves up a nostalgia that was utterly of its time; he incarnates an idea of the city that, even now, remains as strong as its reality and refracts his disappointed ideals into high existential crises.\n",
        "Manhattan is not just Woody Allen's dream movie. Wistful as it is witty, it's his dream of the movies.\n",
        "Allen has, in black and white, captured the inner beauty that lurks behind the outer layer of dirt and grime in Manhattan.\n",
        "Woody Allen's great leap forward into character development and dramatic integrity.\n",
        "This is a deeply self-critical film about immaturity and the gift of real love. Many films can be said to put an epitaph on the decade, but few remain as relevant.\n",
        "Woody Allen's gem of comic kvetching.\n",
        "Mr. Allen's progress as one of our major filmmakers is proceeding so rapidly that we who watch him have to pause occasionally to catch our breath.\n",
        "If Manhattan was only a romantic comedy, it would be a very good one, but the fact that the movie has so much more ambition than the 'average' entry into the genre makes it an extraordinary example of the fusion of entertainment and art.\n",
        "Seeing it again I realize it's more subtle, more complex, and not about love, but loss.\n",
        "Substance is here in spades, along with the twisted, brilliantly controlled style on which filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen made a name.\n",
        "It never fully convinces in terms of either period or plot.\n",
        "The Coens' take on Depression-era gangster flicks, looks gorgeous and showcases John Turturro's best acting ever.\n",
        "It's arguably the US mainstream's first art movie since Days of Heaven; and quite wonderful.\n",
        "Without much point at all.\n",
        "Crossing is the kind of movie that benefits from a second sitting, to get a complete grip on the plot.\n",
        "While Miller's Crossing is not as messy or inspired as Martin Scorsese's GoodFellas, or as richly suggestive as The Godfather, it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do.\n",
        "There is a lot here to admire.\n",
        "As disturbing and densely beautiful as its opening image.\n",
        "Williams, who has comparatively little screen time, has come to act, not to cut comic riffs, and he does so with forceful, ultimately compelling, simplicity.\n",
        "Story sings whenever Williams is onscreen. Screen belongs just as often to Leonard, who as Neil has a quality of darting confidence mixed with hesitancy. Hawke, as the painfully shy Todd, gives a haunting performance.\n",
        "The moral divisions set up between characters are childishly overdrawn; and, worst of all, the behavior shown by the boys and adults frequently reeks of falsity and contrivance.\n",
        "Weir infuses the film with his customary mysticism, but more importantly, draws sensitive performances from his largely inexperienced cast.\n",
        "The movie undercuts Mr. Williams's exceptionally fine performance, making the character seem more of a dubious fool than is probably intended.\n",
        "It's a literate though strained uplifter, a not altogether compatible coupleting of Rocky Balboa and the Bard.\n",
        "Not the worst of the countless recent movies about good kids and hidebound, authoritatian older people. It may, however, be the most shameless in its attempt to pander to an adolescent audience.\n",
        "Solid, smart entertainment.\n",
        "The emotional elevation of the film is due in no small measure to the extraordinarily engaging performances of Anne Bancroft as the wife-mother-mistress, Dustin Hoffman as the lumbering Lancelot, and Katherine Ross as his fair Elaine.\n",
        "It's consistently fleet and funny, even as it probes the heady abandon and looming hangover that typified the decade of discontent.\n",
        "The screenplay, which begins as genuine comedy, soon degenerates into spurious melodrama.\n",
        "The film itself is very broken-backed, partly because Anne Bancroft's performance as the mother carries so much more weight than Katharine Ross' as the daughter, partly because Nichols couldn't decide whether he was making a social satire or a farce.\n",
        "Makes you feel a little tearful and choked-up while it is making you laugh yourself raw.\n",
        "A delightful, satirical comedy-drama.\n",
        "A simple romantic comedy whose \"countercultural\" message, insofar as it has one, is decidedly retrograde.\n",
        "It is a good topical movie whose time has passed\n",
        "Few movies have communicated with such dark hilarity all the anxiety and flamboyant misery of youthful sexual initiation\n",
        "What I don't enjoy is the cruelty, the glib mindlessness, and the insulated, pampered narcissism that makes the whole thing possible.\n",
        "Has no one else found it highly peculiar that damn near everybody's choice for the best movie of (let's say) the decade should be dedicated, inferentially but absolutely, to the proposition that Courage is Madness and Cowardice is Best?\n",
        "Part of the success of The Bridge is that its courageous hero is shown from all angles, in all kinds of mirrors. He is strong, stubborn, fallible, maniacal, silly, and wise; and in the end he is pathetic, noble, and foolish.\n",
        "From sky to ground in two shots, and it already feels like we've traversed a great distance, with two and a half hours of skillful, suspenseful WWII adventure to go.\n",
        "It is a whale of a story, and in the telling of it, British Director David Lean does a whale of a job.\n",
        "A gripping drama, expertly put together and handled with skill in all departments.\n",
        "For what it is, it ain't bad, though it serves mainly as an illustration of the ancient quandary of revisionist moviemakers: if all you do is systematically invert cliches, you simply end up creating new ones.\n",
        "A classic example of a film that fudges the issues it raises.\n",
        "In my opinion, it is one of the two best films to emerge from a very strong decade of cinema.\n",
        "Brilliant is the word, and no other, to describe the quality of skills that have gone into the making of this picture.\n",
        "Most war movies are either for or against their wars. The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) is one of the few that focuses not on larger rights and wrongs but on individuals.\n",
        "Treasure of Sierra Madre is one of the best things Hollywood has done since it learned to talk; and the movie can take a place, without blushing, among the best ever made.\n",
        "John Huston has rarely been in better form than in this 1948 study of gold fever and worse obsessions among an unlikely trio of prospectors...\n",
        "There's a quite enjoyable yarn buried under the hollow laughter.\n",
        "The movie has never really been about gold but about character, and Bogart fearlessly makes Fred C. Dobbs into a pathetic, frightened, selfish man -- so sick we would be tempted to pity him, if he were not so undeserving of pity.\n",
        "Greed, a despicable passion out of which other base ferments may spawn, is seldom treated in the movies with the frank and ironic contempt that is vividly manifested toward it in Treasure of Sierra Madre.\n",
        "The characters here are probed and thoroughly penetrated, not through psychoanalysis but through a crucible of human conflict, action, gesture and expressive facial tones.\n",
        "A climatic rebirth-by-chainsaw scene almost makes it all worthwhile, though you may have had to visit the bathroom once or twice in the wait.\n",
        "Duck Soup should make practically everybody laugh.\n",
        "The Marx Brothers' best movie...\n",
        "It also includes what is perhaps the Brothers' funniest scene ever: an immaculately timed and performed sequence with a broken mirror in which Groucho, Chico and Harpo look absolutely identical. A masterpiece.\n",
        "This production is, for the most part, extremely noisy without being nearly as mirthful as [the Marx brothers'] other films.\n",
        "The Marx Brothers created a body of work in which individual films are like slices from the whole, but Duck Soup (1933) is probably the best.\n",
        "The film doesn't seem to have much of a focus. But it doesn't seem to want one, either.\n",
        "A masterpiece.\n",
        "Kubrick has made a movie that will have to be reckoned with on the highest level.\n",
        "As a ghost story and adaptation of the Stephen King novel, it's largely a failure. On the other hand, as an example of directorial bravura and as a study of madness and the unreliable narrator, it's a brilliant success.\n",
        "Kubrick is after a cool, sunlit vision of hell, born in the bosom of the nuclear family, but his imagery -- with its compulsive symmetry and brightness -- is too banal to sustain interest, while the incredibly slack narrative line forestalls suspense.\n",
        "The movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies it sets loose in an isolated situation primed to magnify them.\n",
        "With everything to work with, director Stanley Kubrick has teamed with jumpy Jack Nicholson to destroy all that was so terrifying about Stephen King's bestseller.\n",
        "I fear all work and no play has made Stanley a dull boy.\n",
        "Kubrick isn't out for screams, but he manages to make his movie thoroughly unnerving by keeping the horror so close to home.\n",
        "Just when things start getting too grisly, Raimi rushes in with a hilarious, sendup joke to remind us that all this blood and guts is meant in spooky Grand Guignol fun.\n",
        "Evil Dead 2 is, pardon the expression, consistently lively -- a ghoulish splatter comedy that uses wildly excessive gore to provoke the kind of shock that lies between a laugh and a scream.\n",
        "Good acting would not have served the material well, since it would have diluted the comedy quotient and made the campy elements seem cheap and cheesy.\n",
        "A flashy good-natured display of special effects and scare tactics so extreme they can only be taken for laughs.\n",
        "The pop-up humor and smirkiness suggest Raimi's aspiring to the fashionable company of the brothers Coen, though on the basis of this strained effort I'd say he's overshot the mark.\n",
        "Delirious, demented and diabolically funny.\n",
        "Genuine, if bizarre, proof of Sam Raimi's talent and developing skill.\n",
        "If you know it's all special effects, and if you've seen a lot of other movies and have a sense of humor, you might have a great time at Evil Dead 2.\n",
        "The acting is straight out of '50s B movies. The exposition is clumsy, the sound track corny, the denouement silly. Then again, who said bad taste was easy?\n",
        "Is it as good as its advance word and nine Academy Award nominations suggest? Yes.\n",
        "This excruciatingly violent, three-hour Viet Nam saga demolishes the moral and ideological cliches of an era: it shoves the audience into hell and leaves it stranded without a map.\n",
        "The film is ambitious and it succeeds on a number of levels and it proves that Cimino is an important director who deserves to be watched carefully.\n",
        "A disgusting account of what the evil Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans stands at the center of this Oscar-laden weepie about macho buddies from a small industrial town.\n",
        "This is probably one of the few great films of the decade.\n",
        "It is a heartbreakingly effective fictional machine that evokes the agony of the Vietnam time.\n",
        "Its feelings for time, place and blue-collar people are genuine, and its vision is that of an original, major new film maker.\n",
        "The movie's a maelstrom of possibilities touching ethnic relations, high art, fashion and modern morality, not to mention cinema.\n",
        "As with so many pop moments a quarter-century on, what once looked sexy now smells a little sexist.\n",
        "Diva, as a lifestyle, a fantasy, a model for alienation and solipsism and eccentricity, has gone deep into all of us.\n",
        "An elaborate, subtitled exercise in blowing hot air.\n",
        "A light-headed, fleet-footed French caper, Jean-Jacques Beineix's ultra-stylish Diva stormed the art houses when it was released in 1982, and it's still a lot of fun now -- though its hip patina feels more quaint these days than cool.\n",
        "I still loved every minute of it.\n",
        "Made with wit and humor, this French stunner abounds in the go-for-broke spirit of a first film made by a talented, nervy director.\n",
        "This is style as a force of nature.\n",
        "It's a supremely gorgeous and supremely shallow motion picture, but it believes in art with a capital A. And practically nobody does anymore.\n",
        "Any film with this much stylistic assurance is impossible to fully resist.\n",
        "The novel touches, bizarre chases and plot twists, breathtaking camerawork by Philippe Rousselot and tension-filled editing, make Diva a superior piece of entertainment.\n",
        "Half a century later, a glut of uber-groovy meta-thrillers has blunted the novelty of Diva, but its gamboling flair is still a kick.\n",
        "The most exciting debut in years, it is unified by the extraordinary decor - colour supplement chic meets pop art surrealism - which creates a world of totally fantastic reality situated four-square in contemporary Paris.\n",
        "Here is a director taking audacious chances, doing wild and unpredictable things with his camera and actors, just to celebrate moviemaking.\n",
        "...frightfully chic-looking...\n",
        "Groundhog Day may not be the funniest collaboration between Bill Murray and director Harold Ramis... Yet this gentle, small-scale effort is easily the most endearing film of both men's careers, a sweet and amusing surprise package.\n",
        "Murray hasn't made a comedy this winningly dumb and smart and -- yes -- sweet in a long time. If, indeed, he ever has.\n",
        "A movie that continually replays a single day could quickly become tedious but, strangely enough, Groundhog Day never does.\n",
        "Murray's wiseacre persona is perfect for what could be saccharine material in other hands.\n",
        "Even if you applaud Bill Murray's evolution from inspired comedian to minimalist seriocomic actor, it's a relief to revisit his most varied and charming role as Phil Connors.\n",
        "Bill Murray is the one veteran of the Saturday Night Live/SCTV axis who still knows how to enter into a giddy conspiracy with his audience.\n",
        "Considering that none of the characters is fresh or interesting, it's a commendable achievement that the quality of the storytelling alone keeps the movie watchable and likable.\n",
        "[Murray] carries Groundhog Day with his uniquely frittery nonchalance and makes the movie a comic time warp anyone should be happy to get stuck in.\n",
        "Ramis' direction is often too cool and restrained. He wisely avoids playing into the tale's underlying sentimentality.\n",
        "Since arriving as a mild success in 1993, Groundhog Day has gradually achieved the status of beloved. The American Film Institute rates it No.34 on its list of all-time funniest movies, and it's a story that bears frequent repeat viewings.\n",
        "Ramis directs this surreal suburban fantasy with an admirably light touch, revelling in its absurd repetitions, surprising us with narrative ellipses, and allowing Murray ample space to indulge his special mix of sarcasm and smarm.\n",
        "Mr. Murray is back in top form with a clever, varied role that draws upon the full range of his talents.\n",
        "Groundhog will never be designated a national film treasure by the Library of Congress. But, in terms of vehicle selection, this is one of the better ones Murray has hitched himself to.\n",
        "The film is lovable and sweet.\n",
        "This movie has all the qualities necessary to be a crowd-pleaser: likable characters, charismatic performers, a strong, capably-executed premise, and lots of laughs.\n",
        "... brilliantly imaginative ...\n",
        "It shouldn't be missed by anyone with a taste for Eastwood's typically slanted morality. It's the actor/director's best movie -- and the best Western by anybody -- in over 20 years.\n",
        "Unforgiven ain't nuthin' new, y'unnerstan', but it's a good, old-fashioned western-type pitcher with plenty o' rootin' tootin' action 'n' big ol' horses 'n' 10-gallon hats 'n' sech.\n",
        "Eastwood deliberately upends the conventions of the western, subverting his own image in the process.\n",
        "The Western is back. With a vengeance. Saddle up or get out of the way.\n",
        "This is the finest set of performances ever to grace a Clint Eastwood movie, and this time Eastwood even does a good job directing Eastwood. Every bullet in this movie matters.\n",
        "This dark, melancholic film is a reminder-never more necessary than now-of what the American cinema is capable of, in the way of expressing a mature, morally complex and challenging view of the world.\n",
        "Eastwood's meditation on age, repute, courage, heroism -- on all those burdens he has been carrying with such good grace for decades.\n",
        "One of Unforgiven's assets is the way it overturns conventions, taking the man who is typically the hero and making him the villain, while transforming the traditional bad guy into a sympathetic protagonist.\n",
        "A classic Western for the ages.\n",
        "There's not much dramatic urgency apart from the revisionist context.\n",
        "In this dark, timeless terrain, the film achieves a magnificent intensity.\n",
        "Unforgiven is a most entertaining western that pays homage to the great tradition of movie westerns while surreptitiously expressing a certain amount of skepticism.\n",
        "That implacable moral balance, in which good eventually silences evil, is at the heart of the Western, and Eastwood is not shy about saying so.\n",
        "In three decades of climbing into the saddle, Eastwood has never ridden so tall.\n",
        "Jumps adroitly between the macho and anti-macho, the romantic and anti-romantic.\n",
        "By now ... Eastwood has little more than a paint-by-numbers approach to acting. As a result, we relate to Munny more as a compendium of Eastwood's earlier characters.\n",
        "This is the best work Eastwood has done as a director since The Outlaw Josey Wales 16 years ago.\n",
        "Enjoy it for the handsome wide-screen vistas, the interplay of the actors, the classical sweep of its story line. Just don't expect the new, soul-searching Eastwood to be any more dramatically convincing than the old.\n",
        "The perfectly cast Slater effectively propels the film, his intensity and dry delivery giving it a definite edge, as does a soundtrack which includes Ice T, Concrete Blonde and the Cowboy Junkies.\n",
        "It's a howl from the heart, a relentlessly involving movie that gives a kid every reason to believe that he or she can come of age.\n",
        "Despite the fact that picture runs 118 minutes, Frank Capra has expanded on the original play [by Joseph Kesselring] to a sufficient extent to maintain a steady, consistent pace.\n",
        "The timing is abysmal throughout, turning fast pace into numbing frenzy.\n",
        "Good macabre fun.\n",
        "Dusty but gentle entertainment.\n",
        "It isn't often that extremely clever moviemakers use their brains in the service of pure fun. But that's just what the people who made Back to the Future have done. This brilliant contraption of a film could become the hit of the summer.\n",
        "It's big, cartoonish and empty, with an interesting premise that is underdeveloped and overproduced.\n",
        "Zemeckis and Gale... give us two priceless scenes in which the young time-traveler simply regards his parents-to-be with wonderment, delight and empathy. And we cannot help but share that emotion and relate it to our own lives.\n",
        "The picture packs a wonderful wallop.\n",
        "Performances by the earnest Fox, the lunatic Lloyd, the deceptively passionate Lea Thompson, and, particularly, the bumbling-to-confident Glover, who runs away with the picture, merrily keep the ship sailing.\n",
        "Director Robert Zemeckis confronts the oedipal heart of the time-travel genre with this zestfully tasteless 1985 tale about a teenager (Michael J. Fox) who is projected back to 1955 and then must arrange the romance of his parents.\n",
        "The movie has all the benign good nature of a Frank Capra.\n",
        "Mr. Zemeckis is able both to keep the story moving and to keep it from going too far. He handles Back to the Future with the kind of inventiveness that indicates he will be spinning funny, whimsical tall tales for a long time to come.\n",
        "So busy being clever that it trips over its own ingenuity.\n",
        "Shows not only a fine comic touch but also some of the lighthearted humanism of a Frank Capra.\n",
        "One of the mid-'80s most enduring and enjoyable confections: an infectious mix of comedy, fantasy, satire, excitement, and nostalgia.\n",
        "George C. Scott's performance cannot be praised highly enough for capturing both the violence and the vulnerability of the Patton personality without degenerating either into vulgar caricature or cardboard sentimentality.\n",
        "War is hell, and Patton is one hell of a war picture, perhaps one of the most remarkable of its type ever made.\n",
        "Nixon's favorite movie, which proves he was blind to ambiguity as well as a few other things.\n",
        "The film lays bare the roots of Patton's lust for power in his willingess to sacrifice everything to his vaunting ego, a trait which is mirrored in George C Scott's superb performance.\n",
        "It's both fascinating and appalling the sort of extravagant technically superior spectacle that only a big Hollywood movie company could afford to make, and the story of a man about whom only the Establishment could become genuinely sentimental.\n",
        "Scott strikes an unforgettable figure.\n",
        "Scott's theatricality is electrifying.\n",
        "Remains to this day one of Hollywood's most compelling biographical war pictures.\n",
        "The Jim Jarmusch penchant for off-the-wall characters and odd situations is very much in evidence.\n",
        "On the whole I've had more fun in Cleveland.\n",
        "After the initial establishment of character and atmosphere, the laughs come thick and fast, most notably from the marvellous [Roberto] Benigni.\n",
        "The excitement (of Down by Law) comes from the realization that we are seeing a true film maker at work, using film to create a narrative that couldn't exist on the stage or the printed page of a novel.\n",
        "A true original that kind of grows on you.\n",
        "Pure pleasure for comedy connoisseurs.\n",
        "It's not that the movie doesn't move fast enough, it's that while it dawdles, it doesn't give you enough to dwell on.\n",
        "Pounding away, it becomes monotonous.\n",
        "A compendium of the worst cliches of Japanese animation -- two hours of chases, laser attacks, machine-gun battles, spilled stage blood, computer-animated backgrounds and hokey dialogue.\n",
        "The movie, even at 124 minutes, has the densely packed sweep and go-for-it pep of a pop epic.\n",
        "Grade-school violence freaks may find a few kicks here, but even they may have trouble coping with this ugly movie's ending about eight separate times.\n",
        "A lavish animation extravaganza produced at a cost of $8 million, this futuristic exploration is a followup by author-director Katsuhiro Otomo to his tremendously popular comic books.\n",
        "An impressive achievement, often suggesting a weird expressionist blend of 2001, The Warriors, Blade Runner and Forbidden Planet.\n",
        "A phenomenal work of animation with all the hallmarks of an instant cult classic.\n",
        "Easily the most breathtaking and kinetic anime ever made.\n",
        "The most expensive animated feature ever made in Japan... and it's easily the most impressive, as well.\n",
        "Lambert, with his beetle brow, broken nose, and vaguely crossed eyes, remains an amiable oddball presence, and Sean Connery radiates charm and nobility in a bit as an elder immortal who shows Lambert the rules of the game.\n",
        "It's a lot of utterly preposterous fun, even if it doesn't quite hang together.\n",
        "Since none of the characters makes sense even on the movie's own terms, Highlander keeps on exploding for almost two hours, with nothing at stake.\n",
        "Stuart Rosenberg's direction is a horror, but the cast teems with so many familiar faces that this 1967 film can't help but entertain.\n",
        "A picture of chilling dramatic power.\n",
        "Newman gives an excellent performance, assisted by a terriffic supporting cast, including George Kennedy, outstanding as the unofficial leader of the cons who yields first place to Newman.\n",
        "A caustically witty look at the American South and its still-surviving chain gangs, with Newman in fine sardonic form as the boss-baiter who refuses to submit and becomes a hero to his fellow-prisoners.\n",
        "A tough, honest film with backbone.\n",
        "It's as fresh and effective in 2004 as it was in 1967.\n",
        "That traditional object of sorrow and compassion in American folk song and lore, the chain-gang prisoner, is given as strong a presentation as ever he has had on the screen.\n",
        "Audiences, traditionally willing to meet this impossibly romantic classic half way, may have to go a bit further this time.\n",
        "Withal, there is beauty and magic in the things that Cyrano says. He is still a magnificent character. Thank goodness, he is on the screen.\n",
        "At least some of the lines in the Rostand play are good.\n",
        "Wilder's hysteria seems perfectly natural. You never question what's driving him to it; his fits are lucid and total. They take him into a different dimension -- he delivers what Harpo promised.\n",
        "More about the myth of Karloff than the monster, this Mel Brooks pastiche is probably his best early film.\n",
        "For a really delightful parody, James Whale's own Bride of Frankenstein is far better value.\n",
        "It shows artistic growth and a more sure-handed control of the material by a director who once seemed willing to do literally anything for a laugh. It's more confident and less breathless.\n",
        "Some of the gags don't work, but fewer than in any previous Brooks film that I've seen, and when the jokes are meant to be bad, they are riotously poor. What more can one ask of Mel Brooks?\n",
        "Young Frankenstein emerges as a reverently satirical salute to the 1930s horror film genre.\n",
        "Though it may take a while to get Jarmusch's gist, hang in there; by the time Tom Waits growls his lovely closing waltz over the credits, Jarmusch has shown us moments most filmmakers don't even notice.\n",
        "With this, his fourth commercially released feature, Mr. Jarmusch again demonstrates his mastery of comedy of the oblique.\n",
        "At the end, we have learned no great lessons and arrived at no thrilling conclusions, but we have shared the community of the night, when people are unbuttoned and vulnerable - more ready to speak about what's really on their minds.\n",
        "Unfortunately, Jarmusch's lackadaisical minimalist aesthetic and his chronic lack of energy are the only unifying elements.\n",
        "\"Night on Earth\" sounds better than it turns out to be.\n",
        "Night on Earth dawdles a bit, and a couple of the segments, notably the one in Helsinki, feel like half-baked epiphanies. Throughout, though, there are moments that catch you delightfully off guard.\n",
        "Visually ravishing and emotionally cold, Zhang's third feature is one long series of pushes and pulls.\n",
        "A beautifully crafted and richly detailed feat of consciousness-raising and a serious drama with the verve of a good soap opera.\n",
        "Gong Li delivers a performance of exquisite expressiveness that, like the film itself, is unnerving in its emotional nakedness.\n",
        "A near-perfect movie that often recalls the visual purity and intensity of silent films.\n",
        "In purely aesthetic terms, Raise the Red Lantern is breathtaking.\n",
        "The story never amounts to much more than a rather tepid Chinese rendition of The Women.\n",
        "A defining example of Chinese movie-making and one of the best films of the '90s.\n",
        "A Chinese film of voluptuous physical beauty and angry passions.\n",
        "The first full-blown talkie from the biggest star of the silent era, complete with a message that Chaplin couldn't have sent more loudly or clearly.\n",
        "Through no fault of Chaplin's, during the two years he was at work on the picture dictators became too sinister for comedy.\n",
        "Chaplin is at his most profound in suggesting that there is much of the Tramp in the Dictator, and much of the Dictator in the Tramp.\n",
        "Like all major Chaplin works, Dictator was a cheaply, but methodically, made film, a cardboard act of humanist defiance, and, thanks to its purity of purpose, the cheesier the jokes get, the harder they land.\n",
        "It's when he is playing the dictator that the comedian's voice raises the value of the comedy content of the picture to great heights.\n",
        "The representation of Hitler is vaudeville goonery all the way, but minus the acid wit and inventive energy that Groucho Marx managed.\n",
        "It is a funny film, which we expect from Chaplin, and a brave one.\n",
        "The film remains controversial to this day.\n",
        "Now that the waiting is over and the shivers of suspense at an end, let the trumpets be sounded and the banners flung against the sky.\n",
        "It's easy to forget the sheer cojones Charles Chaplin showed when he attacked Adolf Hitler in this 1940 satire.\n",
        "The words most used to describe \"Fantasia,\" besides the conventional \"beautiful\" and \"wonderful\" were \"path-breaking\" and \"courageous.\" The phrase \"courageous beyond belief\" would be even more accurate.\n",
        "Critics may deplore Disney's lapses of taste, but he trips, Mickey-like, into an art form that immortals from Aeschylus to Richard Wagner have always dreamed of.\n",
        "There is something in Fantasia for every taste.\n",
        "The concept and some of the episodes are tainted with kitsch, but there's no other animated film with its scope and ambition.\n",
        "Certainly not to be missed.\n",
        "Fantasia is simply terrific -- as terrific as anything that has ever happened on a screen.\n",
        "This is animation in every sense of the word, as if you are seeing the world through the eyes of your tree-worshipping ancestors.\n",
        "Throughout Fantasia, Disney pushes the edges of the envelope.\n",
        "High Noon combines its points about good citizenship with some excellent picturemaking.\n",
        "Zinnemann carefully and deliberately makes the most of the mood cast by the threat of impending violence.\n",
        "Some of the results ring false, but the memorable theme song and some equally memorable character acting (by Thomas Mitchell and Lon Chaney Jr. more than Lloyd Bridges and Katy Jurado) help things along.\n",
        "High Noon won a fistful of Oscars, but in these days of pasteboard screen machismo, it's worth seeing simply as the anatomy of what it took to make a man before the myth turned sour.\n",
        "More than a half-century later, Foreman was right after all: High Noon is a scorching and sour portrait of American complacence and capacity for collaborationism.\n",
        "Regarded as '50s melodrama, it's nearly perfect.\n",
        "Meaningful in its implications, as well as loaded with interest and suspense, High Noon is a western to challenge Stagecoach for the all-time championship.\n",
        "The Western may be one of the few truly American art forms, and High Noon shows exactly how much potential it can embrace.\n",
        "The Big Sleep is wakeful fare for folks who don't care what is going on, or why, so long as the talk is hard and the action harder.\n",
        "The Big Sleep, though, is witty and sinister, and in an odd way is a realistic portrayal of big-city life with Arabian Nights overtones.\n",
        "Brittle Chandler characters have been transferred to the screen with punch by Howard Hawks' production and direction, providing full load of rough, tense action most of the way.\n",
        "What you remember here are moments.\n",
        "This is arguably the high-water mark of Hollywood's love affair with the infinitely slippery possibilities of the English language.\n",
        "It's likely to leave you confused and dissatisfied.\n",
        "Don't try too hard to follow the story, just get swept away by the mood of the film.\n",
        "A movie that every film student should study and every movie lover should watch at least once.\n",
        "Fascinating if not necessarily improved edition of Howard Hawks' 1946 detective classic.\n",
        "It is typical of this most puzzling of films that no one agrees even on why it is so puzzling. Yet that has never affected The Big Sleep's enduring popularity, because the movie is about the process of a criminal investigation, not its results.\n",
        "Heathers locates the emotional totalitarianism lurking in a prom queen's heart.\n",
        "A super-smart black comedy about high school politics and teenage suicide that showcases a host of promising young talents.\n",
        "Two decades later, Heathers is so on the money, with its vague but unmistakable parallels to several school shootings, that it could never be made today.\n",
        "A super-smart black comedy about high school politics and teenage suicide that showcases a host of promising young talents.\n",
        "Its inanities and glib pretensions are so thick that it mainly comes across as tacky and contrived.\n",
        "The film uses an intimate knowledge of teen-movie cliches to subvert their debased values from the inside.\n",
        "As snappy and assured as it is mean-spirited.\n",
        "For a long time, we're not even sure of the point of view: Is this a black comedy about murder or just a cynical morality play? The traveler in the foreign country is not sure, but he knows the film inspires thought.\n",
        "May be the nastiest, cruelest fun you can have without actually having to study law or gird leather products.\n",
        "More than just one of the best movies so far this year, it is a revolution in young-adult entertainment.\n",
        "A charming, witty, passionate romantic drama about a love transcending space and time, Somewhere In Time is an old-fashioned film in the best sense of that term.\n",
        "Director Jeannot Szwarc strains hard for spectacular visual effects, though he's barely able to compose a competent close-up.\n",
        "This must go down as a missed opportunity.\n",
        "The movie surrounds its love story with such boring mumbo jumbo about time travel that we finally just don't care.\n",
        "The [Grand H]otel and Mackinac [Island] are spectacularly lovely, but fail to give substance to this ephemeral endeavor.\n",
        "Assembly-line feature from the John Hughes teen factory.\n",
        "A simple, lovely and thoughtful teenage story that occasionally shines due to fine characterizations and lucid dialog.\n",
        "This time it ends with the underdogs together. Oddly enough, it's this conclusion that feels phony, seeing as Stoltz has spent the last 80 minutes arranging his dream date with Lea.\n",
        "The film creates a perfect embodiment of every adolescent's nightmare.\n",
        "Lighter and less filling than usual.\n",
        "Some Kind of Wonderful is yet another film in which Hughes and his team show a special ability to make an entertaining movie about teenagers.\n",
        "Like her energy, Masterson's beauty is kinetic, internalized, and she's a winner even if the film itself runs third in the Hughes opus on teenhood.\n",
        "A highly unusual and an unusually fine film.\n",
        "No one seems to know what to do with the allegorical undertone of Jerzy Kosinski's script, but as a whole this 1979 film maintains a fine level of wit, sophistication, and insight.\n",
        "What emerges in the end is a strange ambiguity of attitude to the American political system and a hollow humour about cultural values. The cinema of cynicism, really.\n",
        "Hal Ashby directs Being There at an unruffled, elegant pace, the better to let Mr. Sellers's double-edged mannerisms make their full impression upon the audience.\n",
        "Satire is a threatened species in American film, and when it does occur, it's usually broad and slapstick, as in the Mel Brooks films. Being There, directed by Hal Ashby, is a rare and subtle bird that finds its tone and stays with it.\n",
        "In playing Gandhi, an actor must be less concerned with physical verisimilitude than with spiritual presence, and here Kingsley is nothing short of astonishing.\n",
        "Once in a long while a motion picture so eloquently expressive and technically exquisite comes along that one is tempted to hail it as being near perfect.\n",
        "Attenborough's work lacks even the undercurrent of personality that David Lean brought to his films: the film has no flavor but that of the standard Hollywood hagiography.\n",
        "Its faults rather pale beside the epic nature of its theme, and Kingsley's performance in the central role is outstanding.\n",
        "A remarkable experience.\n",
        "[Of] importance is the possibility that the film will bring Gandhi to the attention of a lot of people around the world for the first time, not as a saint but as a self-searching, sometimes fallible human being with a sense of humor as well as of history.\n",
        "A Room With a View is not only uncharacteristically benign for Forster, but also blithely, elegantly funny, which is a fit description of [this]first-rate film adaptation...\n",
        "It is an intellectual film, but intellectual about emotions: It encourages us to think about how we feel, instead of simply acting on our feelings.\n",
        "The humor is relentlessly cruel, smug, and disconnected from any sense of how human beings might behave in similar situations.\n",
        "What lifts the production above the run-of-the-mill is swift direction by Martha Coolidge, who has a firm grasp over the manic material.\n",
        "It does make you wonder if the drive of the US education system is ultimately to develop better weapons of mass-destruction, though Coolidge's movie is too hazily good-natured to capitalise on the tougher aspects of the material.\n",
        "What the film needs, instead of these familiar teen-movie trappings, is a cleverness and eccentricity to match that of its characters. For the most part, these are qualities that it lacks.\n",
        "Real Genius contains many pleasures, but one of the best is its conviction that the American campus contains life as we know it.\n",
        "It must be nerve-racking for the producers to offer a tale so lacking in standard melodramatic satisfactions. But the result is worth it, for this is the clearest film statement yet on how the nature of heroism has changed in this totalitarian century.\n",
        "The screen is swamped by a bathetic, self-preening sententiousness.\n",
        "The intent and outward trappings are all impressively in place, but at its heart there's something missing.\n",
        "The film's overall thrust - angry, intelligent, compassionate -- makes this producer Puttnam's finest movie to date.\n",
        "The best moments are the human ones, the conversations, the exchanges of trust, the waiting around, the sudden fear, the quick bursts of violence, the desperation.\n",
        "The movie is diffuse and wandering. It's someone telling a long, interesting story who can't get to the point.\n",
        "The director, Roland Joffe, and his photographer, Chris Menges, capture all of this with a realism that hasn't been so poetically convincing in a nondocumentary context since Gillo Pontecorvo's Battle of Algiers.\n",
        "A series of emotionally wrenching moments that made My Life as a Dog a transatlantic hit when it arrived in 1985.\n",
        "A lot of the movie is routine coming-of-age stuff.\n",
        "Well-constructed crowd-pleaser.\n",
        "[A] nifty interstellar meller.\n",
        "An engaging 1956 science fiction gloss of Shakespeare's Tempest.\n",
        "Imaginative gadgets galore, plus plenty of suspense and thrills, make the production a top offering in the space travel category.\n",
        "Offers some of the most amusing creatures conceived since the Keystone cops.\n",
        "An ingenious script, excellent special effects and photography, and superior acting, make it an endearing winner.\n",
        "All of this would work better if Robinson built up the reality of the town more, made the citizens a more palpable presence, as Frank Capra did in Hollywood's greatest fable-fantasy, It's a Wonderful Life.\n",
        "The sentimentality, of which there is plenty, is nicely balanced by a humor of ironic pragmatism, as when Ray, having built his baseball field as a monument to human dreams, decides to charge tourists $20 a head to visit it.\n",
        "Despite a lovely cameo turn by Burt Lancaster, Field of Dreams is the male weepie at its wussiest.\n",
        "The life-equals-baseball masterpiece still packs an unexpected kick.\n",
        "Field of Dreams sustains a dreamy mood in which the idea of baseball is distilled to its purest essence: a game that stands for unsullied innocence in a cruel, imperfect world.\n",
        "The conception is sentimental, but the storytelling remains assured and effective.\n",
        "Pure magic.\n",
        "It seems much easier to fall into Field of Dreams than to resist its warm, intelligent, timely appeal to our most idealistic selves.\n",
        "[A] gooey fable.\n",
        "The movie may steal a base here and there, but there are no homers.\n",
        "Field of Dreams will not appeal to grinches and grouches and realists. It is a delicate movie, a fragile construction of one goofy fantasy after another. But it has the courage to be about exactly what it promises.\n",
        "Poesy, pointlessness and baseball worship aside, the movie is easy to get along with.\n",
        "John Huston has been wanting to make this movie for more than 20 years. It was worth the wait.\n",
        "A too-broad comedy, mostly due to the poor performance of Michael Caine.\n",
        "Connery and Caine (both excellent) become classic Huston overreachers, and echoes of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Moby Dick permeate the mythic yarn.\n",
        "It's a tall tale, a legend, of steadfastness, courage, camaraderie, gallantry and greed, though not necessarily in that order.\n",
        "It's been a long time since there's been an escapist entertainment quite this unabashed and thrilling and fun.\n",
        "You have to admire the craft and assurance of the thing even as its artificiality hits you in the face.\n",
        "Every character, every scene, is marred by the film's double view, which oscillates between sympathy and farce.\n",
        "The John Foreman production is episodic, but George Roy Hill's direction is so satisfying in catching the full value of the Goldman screenplay that a high degree of interest is sustained.\n",
        "One of the funniest, if slightest, Westerns of recent years.\n",
        "William Goldman's script is constantly too cute and never gets up the nerve, by God, to admit it's a Western.\n",
        "Very funny in a strictly contemporary way-the last exuberant word on movies about the men of the mythic American West who have outlived their day.\n",
        "Although Butch Cassidy wasn't the first movie to pair up a couple of wisecracking best friends in an action/adventure setting, this film became the model of how well that approach could work when done right.\n",
        "Reiner wants to maintain the sitcom sense of comfort and familiarity; he creates types that we somehow already know, slightly out-of-focus images in which we can see ourselves and our friends.\n",
        "When Harry Met Sally pleasantly affirms the institution of marriage while showing how difficult it is to achieve a lasting one.\n",
        "The summer's uncorseted, unqualified delight.\n",
        "If you love vintage Woody Allen, you'll like the nouveau Rob Reiner.\n",
        "During the slow passages, I wondered to what extent the film's creators are aware of its Woodyisms, and to what degree they feel guilty about ripping Allen off.\n",
        "ike Harry and Sally, the movie is hardworking, spot on; it winepresses its conversation into epigrams.\n",
        "Fans of Billy Crystal's amphibian qualities may be amused, but the rest of us have to contend with a slavish Woody Allen imitation.\n",
        "Rob Reiner directs with deftness and sincerity, making the material seem more engaging than it is, at least until the plot machanics begin to unwind and the film starts to seem shapeless.\n",
        "Reiner clearly likes his characters, and elicits sturdy performances from a proficient cast (Kirby and Fisher are especially fine as friends and confidants to the pair).\n",
        "What Harry and Sally do -- the true focus of this often funny but amazingly hollow film -- is saunter through the romanticized lives of intelligent, successful, neurotic New Yorkers.\n",
        "A ravishing, romantic lark brimming over with style, intelligence and flashing wit.\n",
        "When Harry Met Sally... is a sweet, embraceable comedy, a moonstruck Manhattan romance that, like a Gershwin tune, turns the sighs and glances, the spats and reconciliations, all the cliches of the heart into infectious melody.\n",
        "What makes it special, apart from the Ephron screenplay, is the chemistry between Crystal and Ryan.\n",
        "Offers an often humorous, occasionally poignant view of men, women, sex, love, and friendship.\n",
        "The women (played by Tilda Swinton and Amy Madigan) are so intriguing and complex that they almost overcome the trappings of a non-linear narrative that's borderline academic.\n",
        "The result is short on plot but long on observational detail and psychological resonance.\n",
        "Even if it works better as a provocative psychological treatise than as art, it does come alive and does provide major roles for Tilda Swinton and Amy Madigan.\n",
        "Often too pretentious to be profound.\n",
        "Taken as a whole, this is not a product of the cookie cutter and should be of interest to the adventurous filmgoer.\n",
        "This film is steamy, pulsing with veracity, boldly performed.\n",
        "Thanks to the mercurial fluency of Ms. Swinton's hot-and-cold performance, Eve emerges as much more than a symbolic case study of a powerful woman inwardly tearing herself to pieces.\n",
        "Dreamy but seemingly endless, ambitious but affected, daring but banal film.\n",
        "This is the kind of movie you can't stop thinking about.\n",
        "The first movie I have seen that does not improve on the sight of a blank screen viewed for the same length of time.\n",
        "This is good stuff. Unfortunately, director Herb Gardner is a little too fond of writer Herb Gardner's script, which just keeps going and going and going -- until even two old pros such as Walter and Ossie have worn out their welcome.\n",
        "Good acting has salvaged many a poor script in the past, but not here.\n",
        "Alien 3 belongs to that branch of fantasy comics, best exemplified by the Road Warrior movies, in which the iron and space ages meet for dizzy results.\n",
        "Bold and haunting\n",
        "Barely watchable and not especially enjoyable.\n",
        "Ironically, Alien 3 is not a bad movie. In fact -- here's the rub -- it's too interesting to make an exciting summer flick.\n",
        "May satisfy fans of the earlier films ... but it won't win any new converts.\n",
        "There are a few narrative twists, but not enough new ideas to keep us guessing. In the end, we're stuck running through air shafts and corridors again.\n",
        "A grimly seductive end-of-the-world thriller, with pop-tragic overtones that build in resonance as the movie goes on.\n",
        "Not just gory but actually frightening, not just funny but clever, 'American Werewolf...' has its flaws, but these are outweighed by the film's many, mighty strengths.\n",
        "A clever mixture of comedy and horror which succeeds in being both funny and scary, An American Werewolf in London possesses an overriding eagerness to please that prevents it from becoming off-putting.\n",
        "It's a failure, less because the odd stylistic mix doesn't take (it does from time to time, and to striking effect) than because Landis hasn't bothered to put his story into any kind of satisfying shape.\n",
        "Seems curiously unfinished, as if director John Landis spent all his energy on spectacular set pieces and then didn't want to bother with things like transitions, character development, or an ending.\n",
        "Considering its often campy competition, it's hard to argue that, if your in the mood for lycanthropy, London is the place to go.\n",
        "There is hardly anything original about the picture.\n",
        "To pad things out characters argue over story-lines from previous Amityville movies, while for 3-D purposes, wasps, furniture and minor players are hurled in our direction at varying intervals.\n",
        "The cast is good, but the characters are idiots.\n",
        "The problem with The Amityville Horror is that, in a very real sense, there's nothing there.\n",
        "A few lines get laughs, but the horror is standard fare, without a shred of innovation.\n",
        "Never buy a house with a basement, and while you're at it, avoid old Dutch Colonials in which the previous occupants were murdered by an eldest son possessed by demons.\n",
        "Nothing gets in the way of the rote staging, the ham-handed predictability, the feeling that you've been to this house, and yawned at these ghosts, once too often.\n",
        "The Amityville Horror is a Xerox so tattered and faded that it's impossible to determine who's to blame for the overproduced mediocrity before our eyes.\n",
        "You'll want to get out of Amityville long before the Lutzes do.\n",
        "I wasn't shocked by The Amityville Horror, or outraged by it: I felt nothing but disdain.\n",
        "Brevity is the single best thing about it.\n",
        "In theory, this should all be scary, but it just isn't. You giggle at the B-movie cheesiness of it.\n",
        "It retains the cheesy look of the 1979 original, pure schlock not gussied up to appear to be anything else.\n",
        "This house springs so many FX shocks it plays like a theme-park ride. Result? It's not scary, just busy.\n",
        "In a ghost story, the narrative doesn't have to be a model of originality or coherence, but it needs to support the scares. In The Amityville Horror, the writing is so bad that it detracts from the 'boo!' moments and creepy interludes.\n",
        "The original is still creepy, but this Horror will have fans jumping in their seats and talking back to the screen.\n",
        "The startling thing about the remake is that it's one of the better horror films to hit screens in recent months, thanks to its refusal to take itself too seriously."

        "A cut-to-order MTV hack attack. Audiences will be stunned not because they have been frightened but by how obvious and safe the whole thing is.\n",
        "Like good drive-in fare from the '70s, this is all about sensation.\n",
        "Morrisey long showed that his films, although more implicit in sex, drugs and characterizations, were really Hollywood films at the core.\n",
        "One of the two schlocky horror comedies Paul Morrissey made in Italy in 1974... Blood for Dracula is the sexier and funnier.\n",
        "Often startlingly beautiful to look at.\n",
        "Drawing from the relatively invisible literary talents of Daphne DuMaurier and Evan Hunter, Alfred Hitchcock has fashioned a major work of cinematic art, and \"cinematic\" is the operative term here, not \"literary\" or \"sociological.\"\n",
        "Few films depict so eerily yet so meticulously the metaphysical and historical sense of a world out of joint.\n",
        "Hitch's much misappreciated follow-up to Psycho is arguably the greatest of all disaster films -- a triumph of special effects, as well as the fountainhead of what has become known as gross-out horror.\n",
        "The movie flaps to a plotless end.\n",
        "Beneath all of this elaborate feather bedlam lies a Hitch cock-and-bull story that's essentially a fowl ball.\n",
        "Alfred Hitchcock's most abstract film (1963), and perhaps his subtlest, still yielding new meanings and inflections after a dozen or more viewings.\n",
        "It's fierce and Freudian as well as great cinematic fun, with ample fodder for the amateur psychologist following up on Hitch's tortuous involvement with his leading ladies.\n",
        "Mr. Hitchcock and his associates have constructed a horror film that should raise the hackles of the most courageous and put goose-pimples on the toughest hide.\n",
        "An exciting melodrama, not as good as it ought to be but a cut above the ordinary trapdoor-and-winding-sheet type of mystery film.\n",
        "A sublimated ghost story related with all surface seriousness and above all with a remarkably effective background of creepy atmosphere.\n",
        "The opening scenes, set in Dracula's castle, are magnificent -- grave, stately, and severe. But the film becomes unbearably static once the action moves to England.\n",
        "Not by any means the masterpiece of fond memory or reputation, although the first twenty minutes are astonishingly fluid and brilliantly shot by Karl Freund.\n",
        "With Mr. Browning's imaginative direction and Mr. Lugosi's makeup and weird gestures, this picture succeeds to some extent in its grand guignol intentions.\n",
        "Dracula deserves its status as a classic, although one might be tempted to append the word 'lesser' to that label.\n",
        "Certainly it is Lugosi's performance, and the cinematography of Karl Freund, that make Tod Browning's film such an influential Hollywood picture.\n",
        "Screenwriters Hurlbut & Balderston and Director James Whale have given it the macabre intensity proper to all good horror pieces, but have substituted a queer kind of mechanistic pathos for the sheer evil that was Frankenstein.\n",
        "Karloff manages to invest the character with some subtleties of emotion that are surprisingly real and touching.\n",
        "Whale added an element of playful sexuality to this version, casting the proceedings in a bizarre visual framework that makes this film a good deal more surreal than the original.\n",
        "Another astonishing chapter in the career of the Monster.\n",
        "Whale's most perfectly realised movie, a delight from start to finish.\n",
        "Seen today, Whale's masterpiece is more surprising than when it was made because today's audiences are more alert to its buried hints of homosexuality, necrophilia and sacrilege. But you don't have to deconstruct it to enjoy it.\n",
        "The Bride of Frankenstein has an in-your- face audacity that hasn't dimmed all that much after 63 years.\n",
        "Candyman is an uppper-register horror item that delivers the requisite shocks and gore but doesn't cheat or cop out.\n",
        "Like so many post-Val Lewton horror films, this 1992 feature starts out promisingly while the plot is mainly a matter of suggestion, but gradually turns gross and obvious as the meanings become literal and unambiguous.\n",
        "One of the best sustained horror movies for some years.\n",
        "The film's spooky atmosphere is accentuated by Anthony B. Richmond's cinematography and Philip Glass's score.\n",
        "Madsen is a much better actress than is usually found in such a role. However, if you don't like splashes of blood or bees swarming out of bodies, you may want to think twice about this one.\n",
        "What I liked was a horror movie that was scaring me with ideas and gore, instead of simply with gore.\n",
        "A voluptuously shot horror movie.\n",
        "More superpowers from Brian De Palma, this time in high school, in a screen version of a Stephen King novel that's become a horror classic.\n",
        "An exercise in high style that even the most unredeemably rational among moviegoers should find enormously enjoyable.\n",
        "Carrie is a modest but effective shock-suspense drama about a pubescent girl, her evangelical mother and cruel schoolmates.\n",
        "This 1976 thriller, about a high school outcast (Sissy Spacek) who uses her telekinetic powers to massacre the graduating class, contains a number of interesting ideas. But as with most of his films, De Palma can't keep track of them.\n",
        "The fierce sympathy it extends to its unfashionable central character puts the film a million miles above the contemporary line in sick exploitation.\n",
        "It is sometimes funny in a puzzling kind of way, it is generally overwrought in an irritating kind of way, and once in a while it is inappropriately touching.\n",
        "Young director Brian DePalma is fast making his reputation in the genre of the suspense-horror film.\n",
        "Brian De Palma's Carrie is an absolutely spellbinding horror movie, with a shock at the end that's the best thing along those lines since the shark leaped aboard in Jaws.\n",
        "There is little suspense or dramatic tension; everything plays out like bad melodrama or cheap exploitation.\n",
        "Paul Schrader's hammering, art-porno remake of Jacques Tourneur's deft little thriller.\n",
        "Kinski was essential to the film as conceived, and she's endlessly watchable.\n",
        "The seductively exotic surface of this mythically underpinned fantasy might be offset for some by much graphic gore, but if you can buy the romantic metaphors for the primitivisms of sexual obsession, the film delivers down the line.\n",
        "Cat People is a good movie in an old tradition, a fantasy-horror film that takes itself just seriously enough to work, has just enough fun to be entertaining, [and] contains elements of intrinsic fascination in its magnificent black leopards.\n",
        "A highly imaginative horror film that provides the requisite shocks to keep fans of the genre happy.\n",
        "Craven vitalizes the nightmare sequences with assorted surrealist novelties.\n",
        "It's all good scary fun.\n",
        "A Nightmare on Elm Street... puts more emphasis on bizarre special effects, which aren't at all bad.\n",
        "Still stands on its own as an intriguing and chilling example of how horror works best when the characters and the audience don't have to be lobotomized.\n",
        "It is the sort of thing one could watch at midnight without its having much effect upon one's slumbering hours.\n",
        "Never mind that much of the story of this first important screen version of the Dracula legend seems corny and dated, for what counts is its atmosphere and its images, which are timeless in their power.\n",
        "Less frightening than haunting, Murnau's film conjures a persistent atmosphere of dread and decay, thanks in part to Max Schreck's immortal performance as Orlok.\n",
        "It's not just a great horror movie. It's a poem of horror, a symphony of dread, a film so rapt, mysterious and weirdly lovely it haunts the mind long after it's over.\n",
        "The metaphysical style is most vividly rendered by Murnau's obsessive use of point-of-view shots, which force a viewer to follow the characters into the abyss of their terrifying visions.\n",
        "Murnau proved his directorial artistry in Sunrise for Fox about three years earlier, but in this picture he's a master artisan demonstrating not only a knowledge of the subtler side of directing but in photography.\n",
        "The film shows Murnau's uncanny mixture of expressionism and location shooting at its finest.\n",
        "A masterpiece of the German silent cinema and easily the most effective version of Dracula on record.\n",
        "Murnau's classic vampire movie, though not his best film, remains one of the most poetic of all horror films.\n",
        "As vampire movies go, few are more memorable than Nosferatu, which is not only the first screen version of Dracula, but, in some ways, remains the best.\n",
        "It doesn't scare us, but it haunts us. It shows not that vampires can jump out of shadows, but that evil can grow there, nourished on death.\n",
        "Richard Donner directs more for speed than mood, but there are a few good shocks.\n",
        "Richard Donner's direction is taut. Players all are strong.\n",
        "This apocalyptic movie mostly avoids physical gore to boost its relatively unoriginal storyline with suspense, some excellent acting (especially from Warner and Whitelaw), and a very deft, incident-packed script.\n",
        "A member of the Exorcist family, it is a dreadfully silly film, which is not to say that it is totally bad.\n",
        "As long as movies like The Omen are merely scaring us, they're fun in a portentous sort of way.\n",
        "An amusingly caustic, straight-up serving of film noir staples spiced with star charisma.\n",
        "An engrossing thriller - and one sparkling with intelligence, with the surprising twists grounded in credible human behaviour.\n",
        "When Bob Rafelson decides to get nasty, he really means it.\n",
        "It's a morality play, really, but dripping with humid sex and violence.\n",
        "The movie's own payoff is compelling enough, but the project has a weightless feel that limits involvement. Better you give it an hour-and-a-half on video someday, surrounded by wine and snacks.\n",
        "Rafelson is so true to his sour vision of crime, deception and a rottenness at the core of our natures -- he's as cheerful as a Jim Thompson potboiler -- that we never get a chance to like or care about his characters.\n",
        "Nicholson is good, but the movie isn't.\n",
        "Pretentious and show-offy, the noirish drama fairly reeks of film-student overkill.\n",
        "The punchy, nonstop visual effects crowd out coherent storytelling.\n",
        "For a good hour and change, the film is a big toy box that teases you out of the Gloom.\n",
        "It has a refreshing Old World take on a never-ending fantasy war between vampires and the forces of 'light.'\n",
        "What a rabid beast is Night Watch. What a pungent Russian fantasy-horror cheeseathon.\n",
        "This mostly incoherent, enormously eccentric helping of mayhem breaks into so many fragments that watching the movie can be a bit like trying to assemble the pieces from several jigsaw puzzles.\n",
        "Night Watch was one of the most popular movies ever released in Russia. That just proves there's no accounting for taste, in film or in human sacrifice.\n",
        "Goth thrill-junkies will probably get a giddy charge out of this overheated fantasy. The rest of us can have an equivalent experience by putting our brains in a blender and hitting puree.\n",
        "Clarity may be lost, but rare is the movie that grabs viewers by their throats and never lets go. Bekmambetov's Night Watch is one of the grabbers.\n",
        "The faux mythology may be cheesy, the grandiose plot stretched thin and full of holes, but underneath the recycled story and style is a hint of something troubling and real.\n",
        "Even though you couldn't call it a great science fiction movie, on the level of Tarkovsky's Solaris and Stalker it's often a great, heart-pumping, blow-you- to-the walls movie experience.\n",
        "While the movie's inspirations might be glam-Hollywood action fantasies, Night Watch fairly wallows in damp, post-Soviet decay.\n",
        "Though Night Watch is impressive at creating atmosphere, the movie is an impenetrable narrative tangle with plot strands running in every direction.\n",
        "If [Director] Bekmambetov had any skill in actually telling a story, his kitchen-sink trilogy would be something to celebrate. It presently qualifies as a dubious achievement.\n",
        "Although it doesn't have Kate Beckinsale, her guns ablazin', vamped out in the latest vampire-slaying couture, Night Watch is vastly more fun than the similar-themed Underworld pics.\n",
        "Night Watch works better as a demo reel for the state of Russian effects work than as a first installment in an epic trilogy.\n",
        "Unfortunately, by Hollywood standards, Night Watch is about three Wookies and two Neos short of convincing. All the gobbledygook is in place, but the special effects are minimal and somewhat frustrating.\n",
        "The original plan was to remake Night Watch in English, and then thought was given to dubbing it. Thankfully both ideas were scuttled, as the film's Russian-ness and its allusions to post-communist fears and frustrations add greatly to its appeal.\n",
        "Night Watch is shabby chic, with hints of Russia's great silent-cinema past.\n",
        "Ultimately, it's a formulaic, predictable take on a Hollywood staple: the vampire horror film. That's a pretty tired genre, no matter what language it's told in.\n",
        "As opposed to the dreary domestic dramas that are [Russian] cinema's stock in trade, this one is a full-stops-out fantasia that is often disgustingly gloppy and looks as if it was birthed by the Wachowski brothers and Quentin Tarantino.\n",
        "In zooming out from Picard's glinty eyeball, this eighth feature film from the Trek factory displays a zippy new energy and a sleek, confident style fully independent of its predecessors.\n",
        "First Contact is no grab bag of camp gewgaws; it stands proud and apart, accessible even to the Trek-deficient. This old Star, it seems, has a lot of life in it.\n",
        "The elegance of the story is enhanced by the sure direction of Jonathan Frakes, who also plays Commander William Riker.\n",
        "A smashingly exciting sci-fi adventure that ranks among the very best in the long-running Paramount franchise.\n",
        "This makes little concession to non-initiates.\n",
        "The series now lacks all of its original stars and much of its earlier determination. It has morphed into something less innocent and more derivative than it used to be, something the noncultist is ever less likely to enjoy.\n",
        "The excitement comes from Frakes's direction.\n",
        "A nicely constructed science-fiction film, with a simple premise, a charismatic villain and a good back-story to enhance the action.\n",
        "Blessed with clever plot devices and a villainous horde that makes the once-dread Klingons seem like a race of Barneys, First Contact does everything you'd want a Star Trek film to do, and it does it with cheerfulness and style.\n",
        "The first stretch and the home stretch are so filled with visual interest and, more importantly, with the patented Star Trek philosophical and humorous tidbits that fans will gladly suffer the dull Borg patch for the pleasure of the rest.\n",
        "While First Contact espouses the usual lofty Trek ideals, it never forgets to factor in the fun. As the Borg likes to say, resistance is futile -- and also unnecessary.\n",
        "Star Trek: First Contact is one of the best of the eight Star Trek films: Certainly the best in its technical credits, and among the best in the ingenuity of its plot.\n",
        "Following in the wake of a trio of disappointing features, First Contact proves to be the most entertaining Star Trek in more than a decade.\n",
        "A thoroughly enjoyable visit with the crew of TV's Star Trek: The Next Generation.\n",
        "Shine has a story to reckon with and powerhouse male performances.\n",
        "A masterpiece of Southern storytelling.\n",
        "An abundance of long, flat medium shots that rob the film of intimacy and give it a sleepy pace.\n",
        "A mesmerizing parable of good and evil and a splendid example of Southern storytelling at its most poetic and imaginative.\n",
        "If there were the slightest justice and curiosity in the Academy Award process, Thornton's work here would get a nomination.\n",
        "In Sling Blade, Thornton lays claim to the title of hyphenate of the year.\n",
        "The lure of Sling Blade is both elemental and hauntingly familiar, and I would not be surprised if Thornton's breakthrough film is one day considered a classic in its own right.\n",
        "A fine motion picture.\n",
        "[Thornton] does wonders with Yoakam, who could have played a standard villain but always manages to suggest a man trapped within his prejudices.\n",
        "By its midpoint, however, Thornton has begun forcing both the film's poetry and the preternatural goodness of its simple-minded protagonist, and Sling Blade's sweet charms begin to curdle.\n",
        "All the actors in Sling Blade do magnificent work, but it's Thornton who stays with you for days.\n",
        "Sling Blade takes you down paths full of primitive, almost biblical implications, but it also finds comic relief in moments of palpable tension.\n",
        "[Thornton] performance is so good that his directing may be slighted.\n",
        "In this formulaic star vehicle, Schwarzenegger gets to fly like Peter Pan, act like Superman--and fulfill all the fantasies kids may have about their fathers.\n",
        "I liked a lot of the movie, which is genial and has a lot of energy, but I was sort of depressed by its relentlessly materialistic view of Christmas, and by the choice to go with action and (mild) violence over dialogue and plot.\n",
        "Here's Arnie, of all people, playing a bedraggled suburbanite, and his perversely amusing casting boosts a crass, sometimes nasty and finally funny celebration of holiday mass-merchandising and greed.\n",
        "There are many good reasons for going to see The Preacher's Wife.\n",
        "The Preacher's Wife qualifies as old-fashioned Hollywood movie making at its corniest and most saccharine. But the mostly African American cast puts an engaging spin on the chestnut, and it works beautifully.\n",
        "For a movie that might have offered a new twist of the mistletoe, The Preacher's Wife delivers the Scrooge-like acceptable market minimum.\n",
        "The Preacher's Wife is one Christmas picture that actually is in the spirit of the season. It's warm, sentimental, amusing yet serious, bringing fantasy to bear upon the painfully real.\n",
        "A welcome boost for audiences seeking images of black characters without criminal tendencies.\n",
        "This movie could have done more, but what it does, it makes you feel good about.\n",
        "Penny Marshall's remake of The Bishop's Wife is very uneven -- sometimes sweet or soulful, often stiff.\n",
        "If not for the pervasive spirit of the season, something like this could easily send me into sugar shock. It's a little too nice and happy.\n",
        "As warm and cheery as a mug of hot cocoa on a frosty morn.\n",
        "Audiences will respond favorably to its overall warmth, and the motion picture academy may, too.\n",
        "Then there's always Mr. Scofield, bringing an almost unbearable, yet entirely believable, lightness of spirit to his loathsome character. It's a bold stroke by a great actor, making zealotry and evil seem positively beneficent.\n",
        "I recommend Hytner's movie highly, but a part of me resists a work that makes the audience feel as noble in our moral certainty as the characters it invites us to deplore. Some part of its power seems borrowed from the thing it hates.\n",
        "Her cheeks flush, her winsome beauty seared with erotic rage, Ryder exposes the real roots of the piece. Forget McCarthyism; The Crucible is a colonial Fatal Attraction.\n",
        "Too bad, though, that The Crucible fails to probe deeper into the sexual, religious, and political conditions that can give false accusations so much power -- even today.\n",
        "I very much admire how Hytner... keeps the pace swift and doesn't fetishize the 17th-century decors and clothes. But I can't help feeling that in more ways than one, The Crucible is a period piece.\n",
        "What happened in long-ago Salem does still seem to matter.\n",
        "Handsome and well-acted, the film's ultimate success depends on the heat between Ryder and Day-Lewis, and it simply isn't there. The attraction is fatal alright, but it certainly doesn't seem mutual.\n",
        "Neither the establishing dramatic linchpin nor the final conversion of conscience is terribly convincing, leaving this pared-down rendition of the original work diminished in power and meaning as well.\n",
        "Hytner holds the action together with solid, unflashy, well-paced direction, ensuring that this is no mere period piece but a compelling, pertinent account of human fear, frailty and cold ambition.\n",
        "Nothing in the movie is quite up to Scofield's Danforth. But what a mighty performance that is!\n",
        "Day-Lewis, Ryder and Scofield will be odds-on favorites for Oscar nominations, as will the movie itself.\n",
        "There's an awful, piercing truth in the performances of Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Joan Allen and Paul Scofield as members of a community destroyed by guilt, paranoia and betrayal.\n",
        "This stirring film lets you feel the heat of Miller's argument and the urgent power of his kick.\n",
        "Despite these involving moments, The Crucible finally seems too schematic, more useful as an allegory than as drama, and possibly owing that undoubted popularity to its simplistic qualities as much as its insights into group psychology.\n",
        "With a head on its shoulders and the rawest emotions in its craw, Arthur Miller's stage hit The Crucible has become a cinematic grabber for grown-ups -- without that castor oil taste.\n",
        "This version illuminates the story's numerous strengths, resulting in a motion picture of surprising emotional and intellectual impact.\n",
        "Though Hytner remains essentially a stage director, he makes fine use of Massachusetts locations and period interiors; some of the visual details recall Dreyer's Day of Wrath, a film that likely had an influence on Miller's play\n",
        "The first scene in \"The Crucible'' strikes the first wrong note.\n",
        "It is the wittiest, most charming, least pretentious cartoon feature Walt Disney has ever made.\n",
        "While not as indelibly enchanting or inspired as some of the studio's most unforgettable animated endeavors, this is nonetheless a painstaking creative effort.\n",
        "This was the last Disney animated feature (1961) that Uncle Walt lived to see through personally; it can't be a coincidence that it's also the last Disney animated feature of real depth and emotional authenticity.\n",
        "Brilliant entertainment.\n",
        "A rather clever idea, if a bit unsettling.\n",
        "If there's one thing that's absolutely first-rate about the film, it's the character of Cruella.\n",
        "Nothing but a long day's journey into ennui.\n",
        "The expensive effects (under supervision of Douglas Trumbull) are the secret of this film, and the amazing wizardry throughout would appear to justify the whopping budget.\n",
        "This 1979 movie adaptation of the cult TV series is blandness raised to an epic scale.\n",
        "For non-addicts, the smart plot and effects go some way towards compensating for the plastic characters and costumes.\n",
        "[It's] like attending your high-school class's 10th reunion at Caesar's Palace. Most of the faces are familiar, but the decor has little relationship to anything you've ever seen before.\n",
        "Star Trek - The Motion Picture: Director's Edition is no 2001 (its obvious inspiration -- a fact that is more evident here than ever before), but it represents thought-provoking, well constructed science fiction.\n",
        "Weighed down by a midsection even flabbier than the long-in-the-tooth cast, director Nicholas Meyer still delivers enough of what Trek auds hunger for to justify the trek to the local multiplex.\n",
        "Though patchy, this is a lot more fun than the disastrous Star Trek V.\n",
        "The principals' enthusiasm for their material has never seemed to fade. If anything, that enthusiasm grows more appealingly nutty with time.\n",
        "Director/coscripter Nicholas Meyer moves this vehicle efficiently. He employs some tremendous visuals.\n",
        "If, indeed, Star Trek VI turns out to be the last of the series, it couldn't have made a more felicitous or more satisfying exit.\n",
        "For a movie that begins with such promise, The Undiscovered Country ends with a whimper.\n",
        "William Shatner's inauspicious feature directing debut is a double letdown.\n",
        "[The] special effects, despite the hefty budget, look strictly bargain basement.\n",
        "The plot, about a quest for the Ultimate Answer, resembles something Douglas Adams would have thrown in the bin.\n",
        "Captain Kirk and his crew go where too many film makers have too often gone before.\n",
        "Bloated, bombastic and maddeningly pretentious.\n",
        "The whole point of the movie has something to do with the search for God and Eden, but the theme is presented in the most mundane fashion imaginable.\n",
        "A snoozola of astronomic proportions.\n",
        "Of all of the Star Trek movies, this is the worst.\n",
        "There is something comfortable, even old-shoeish, about the new film, a sense, appropriate to its theme of coming to terms with middle age, that all aboard are pleasurably rediscovering their best selves.\n",
        "Star Trek II is a very satisfying space adventure, closer in spirit and format to the popular TV series than to its big-budget predecessor.\n",
        "If only director Nicholas Meyer had grasped the implications of his tale more fully and enthusiastically, this might have become a classic piece of cornball SF poetry, but as it stands the tepid acting and one-set claustrophobia take a heavy toll.\n",
        "The net effect, between embarrassed guffaws, is incredulity: a movie at once post-TV and pre-DW Griffith.\n",
        "Although I liked the special effects in the first movie, they were probably not the point; fans of the TV series wanted to see their favorite characters again, and Trek II understood that desire and acted on it.\n",
        "Here comes a sequel that's worth its salt. The second Star Trek movie is swift, droll and adventurous, not to mention appealingly gadget-happy. It's everything the first one should have been and wasn't.\n",
        "Star Trek II added hefty doses of action, adventure, and suspense, injecting life into a concept that had been left moribund by its first big-screen feature.\n",
        "These are classic directorial occasions, and Nimoy rises to them with fervor, in effect beaming his film up onto a higher pictorial plane than either of its predecessors.\n",
        "An emotionally satisfying science fiction adventure.\n",
        "This 1984 film's few and unimpressive special effects evidently qualify it as science fiction, but the genre it really belongs to is the male weepie: there hasn't been a gooier buddy romance on the screen since Joe Buck took Ratso Rizzo to Miami.\n",
        "Decent SFX, but a little more action wouldn't have gone amiss.\n",
        "This is a good but not great Star Trek movie, a sort of compromise between the first two.\n",
        "The humanity of the Star Trek series, unexpected as it is in a sci-fi setting, remains the series' best feature.\n",
        "'Star Trek III' takes nearly forty minutes, much of which is filled with silly, mystical exposition about the current state of Spock's soul, before things start moving. The last twenty minutes are equally slow, but the stuff in between is quite enjoyable.\n",
        "Latest excursion is warmer, wittier, more socially relevant and truer to its TV origins than prior odysseys.\n",
        "I suspect the unconverted will want to be beamed up pronto.\n",
        "Kirk & Co return to present-day San Francisco to save the whales in the most enjoyable film of the series so far, also returning to the simplistic morality-play format that gave the original TV series its strength.\n",
        "Mr. Nimoy directed this Star Trek installment, and indeed he should probably direct all of them. His technical expertise leaves much to be desired. But his sincerity is unmistakable, and it counts for a lot.\n",
        "This is easily the most absurd of the Star Trek stories -- and yet, oddly enough, it is also the best, the funniest and the most enjoyable in simple human terms.\n",
        "An effective and enjoyable sample of entertainment -- not good science fiction, but a lightweight piece of comic fantasy utilizing characters so familiar that they feel like old friends.\n",
        "A happy, heartfelt chapter that reunites the original cast with the original TV format, shying away from the cold and epic scale of the preceding movie adventures.\n",
        "Immensely pleasurable.\n",
        "As Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands reminded us, Burton always has been more absorbed by what his audience sees than by what his movies say.\n",
        "Batman Returns is the rarest of Hollywood beasts -- a sequel that's better than the original\n",
        "Burton, once an animator at Disney, understands that to go deeper, you must fly higher, to liberation from plot into poetry. Here he's done it. This Batman soars.\n",
        "As in the first movie, Burton gives the material a luxurious masked-ball quality and a sly contemporary wit without violating the myth's low, cheesy comic-book origins.\n",
        "Burton and company return to the prickly humor that gave such a jolt to the earlier film -- frequently finding it in unexpected places.\n",
        "This time the richness of the Batman movie is not in its production design but rather in Burton's and screenwriter Daniel Waters' Freudian view of adult human behavior.\n",
        "Something about the filmmaker's eccentric, surreal, childlike images seems to strike a deep chord in the mass psyche: he makes nightmares that taste like candy.\n",
        "Exhaustingly inventive.\n",
        "More of the same, but nowhere near as good (funny, disturbing, obsessive) as the uneven original, revealing arrested development on every level.\n",
        "Where Burton's ideas end and those of his collaborators begin is impossible to know, but result is a seamless, utterly consistent universe full of nasty notions about societal deterioration, greed and other base impulses.\n",
        "Bigger, louder, more relentlessly action-packed than its predecessor, Batman Returns batters its audience into submission.\n",
        "Because the film's predominant motif is that of wounded individuals re-inventing themselves as wily villains, its most memorable episodes are early ones explaining each main character's transformation.\n",
        "Burton uses the summer's most explosively entertaining movie to lead us back into the liberating darkness of dreams.\n",
        "Like a hyperactive 11-year-old, the director seems both uncomfortable with adult emotions and unable to focus on the overall portrait.\n",
        "Comes closer than ever to Bob Kane's dark, original strip, which began in 1939.\n",
        "Odd and sad, but not exhilarating.\n",
        "Christopher Cain directed this western from a script by John Fusco, and on the whole seems much more comfortable with the scroungy and scatological dialogue than he does with the action sequences.\n",
        "Little more than a flawed romp, but energetic and enjoyable, with sterling performances from Sutherland and Estevez.\n",
        "Young Guns is best watched in the playful, none-too-serious spirit in which it was made.\n",
        "They behave as if our adoration were their birthright.\n",
        "The screenplay is a prepubescent shambles, the direction is by acne out of disposable douches, the dubbing and looping of the songs is painfully obvious, the characterizations are generally repulsive and the whole thing is utterly without style.\n",
        "Travolta is a riot. Alternately swaggering to prove his \"coolness\" and re-affirming his ability on the dance floor, the actor gives the kind of performance that's perfect for the role.\n",
        "Grease holds up for new generations because it captures the enthusiasm of youth and the vibrancy of California's sunshine-and-cars culture.\n",
        "Grease has got it, from the outstanding animated titles of John Wilson all the way through the rousing finale as John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John ride off into teenage happiness.\n",
        "Limp, cheaply made.\n",
        "An unembarrassed movie musical, something my generation experienced only in Sunday-afternoon movies on TV.\n",
        "Its flashy opportunism (nostalgia pitched squarely at an audience too young to even recall the era) quickly becomes very irritating.\n",
        "Its sensibility is not tied to the past but to a free-wheeling, well informed, high-spirited present.\n",
        "The friskiness of the performers, the choreography by Patricia Birch and most of all Travolta's phenomenal charm give it its value.\n",
        "Just an average musical, pleasant and upbeat and plastic.\n",
        "Grease seems kickier now than it did 20 years ago.\n",
        "It may be the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made. Even while you're convulsed with laughter you're still apprehensive, because the editing rhythms are very tricky, and the shock images loom up huge, right on top of you.\n",
        "The result is a fast-paced, straight-line thriller that moves without pause toward the climactic contest at sea between three men and a 25-foot, 3-ton great while killer shark.\n",
        "It is a coarse-grained and exploitive work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written.\n",
        "What this movie is about, and where it succeeds best, is the primordial level of fear.\n",
        "A near Hitchcockian exercise in transference of guilt and making the audience pay for its illicit pleasures.\n",
        "Spielberg may be the man who created the new Hollywood, but in his first megahit he summed up what was best in the old -- the humor, the perversity, and the storytelling integrity of Alfred Hitchcock.\n",
        "Mr. Spielberg has so effectively spaced out the shocks that by the time we reach the spectacular final confrontation between the three men and the great white shark, we totally accept the makebelieve on its own foolishly entertaining terms.\n",
        "Spielberg works self-effacingly, with subtly correct camera placement and meticulous editing. He twists our guts with false alarms, giving us the real thing with heart-stopping suddenness.\n",
        "Steven Spielberg's mechanical thriller is guaranteed to make you scream on schedule.\n",
        "The fast-moving 124-minute film engenders enormous suspense as the shark attacks a succession of people.\n",
        "It's no wonder a generation of holidaymakers still thinks twice before stepping into the water.\n",
        "When it comes to this kind of thriller, no movie has been able to top Jaws, although many have tried. And, as the years go by, it seems increasingly unlikely that anything will come close.\n",
        "One of the most effective thrillers ever made.\n",
        "Surprisingly tepid.\n",
        "Put in a baking tray, gas mark 7, and enjoy a turkey.\n",
        "It's harmless but unsurprising.\n",
        "Using talent of this order on a script this weak, along with merely decorative appearances by the likes of Lauren Bacall and Wilford Brimley, amounts to the Hollywood equivalent of government waste.\n",
        "As political satire, My Fellow Americans makes a poor candidate.\n",
        "Yes, it's Grumpy Old Presidents, in which most of the comedy comes from the supposed shock of hearing two senior citizens cursing at each other in terms Beavis and Butt-head would find inelegant.\n",
        "I'd cheerfully vote the writers, director and producers of My Fellow Americans out of office.\n",
        "The movie suggests we get the government we deserve, but do we really deserve this movie?\n",
        "It takes a special actor's grace to survive a script as lame as My Fellow Americans, and James Garner has it. Without appearing to break a sweat, Garner makes each grotesquely desperate attempt at humor look smooth and assured.\n",
        "An appalling piece of junk.\n",
        "Enthusiastic as one might be that Jack Lemmon has found a new lease on movie life with his Grumpy Old Men series, the funny-crankpots genre wears mighty thin on this road trip.\n",
        "Mr. Lemmon and Mr. Garner are such pros that they carry the movie smoothly over its dull patches.\n",
        "Not every joke works; some clunkers don't even come close. But just when you start to give up on it, the film comes back with a whopper that produces roars of laughter.\n",
        "Shameless laughs flow off the prefab assembly line with sufficient regularity to please audiences with a taste for comfortable tradition spiced with a bit of contempo naughtiness.\n",
        "A gang-written comedy that doesn't have a political bone in its body, or much evidence of a funny one, either.\n",
        "A very bad, uninspired comedy with slight leanings toward self-importance.\n",
        "This is not a great comedy and will be soon forgotten, but it has nice moments.\n",
        "The performers are first rate. Unfortunately, and all too often in movies these days, the script regularly lets them down.\n",
        "Puts a very bright capper on this dismal political year.\n",
        "There are times when I laughed, but, as a whole, this particular buddy film really isn't worth the price of admission.\n",
        "A pleasing but mediocre film, with a great cast, a great story and a misguided script.\n",
        "Pardons for Lemmon and Garner, but none for the filmmakers.\n",
        "Relies heavily on the kick of seeing famous, aging actors muttering vulgarities, doing mildly naughty things and making feeble attempts at political satire.\n",
        "Perhaps they don't create quite enough deeply funny earthlings to go around, but a thoroughly meanspirited big-budget movie is always a treasurable rarity.\n",
        "oaded with wit, nifty little ideas and an extraordinary sense of design, but its allure is of quite a particular nature, much closer to that of Ed Wood than of Burton's earlier, and far more commercially successful, works.\n",
        "Unfortunately, it's not very good.\n",
        "Just a parade of scattershot gags, more often weird than funny and most often just flat.\n",
        "Only moderately amusing.\n",
        "Hilarity never seemed so tedious.\n",
        "This may not be a Christmas movie, but it sure captures the elusive spirit of the season, and the simple pleasure is contagious.\n",
        "Not as much fun as it should be.\n",
        "First he made Ed Wood, a tribute to the man fondly recalled as the worst movie director of all time. Now Tim Burton seems to have made a tribute to Wood's work.\n",
        "A stillborn affair that could have been -- and should have been -- a whole lot hipper and funnier.\n",
        "As light entertainment, Mars Attacks! gave me more pleasure than most other recent movies I've seen.\n",
        "Sadly empty exercise.\n",
        "A throwaway piece of pop ephemera, like a '90s Casino Royale, momentarily arresting and soon forgotten.\n",
        "It's probably too schematic to reward more than a single viewing, but as a provocative one-time surprise it may become a specialized sleeper.\n",
        "Smartly written and boasting a sensational cast, Cameron Crowe's shrewdly observed third feature also gives Tom Cruise one of his very best roles...\n",
        "There is a recognizable ordinariness about the way these people stumble in and out of trouble, in and out of grace -- an ambiguous note, at once tart and sweet, knowing and innocent, in their relationships.\n",
        "Cruise seems to have grown as much as Jerry, for he brings gentleness, warmth and lightheartedness to this role, qualities that we haven't seen since he played air guitar in his underpants in Risky Business 13 years ago.\n",
        "Lauded as a witty moral fable with a revelatory performance from its star, this romantic comedy is in fact meretricious, manipulative and reactionary.\n",
        "Disarming acting, colorful writing and true generosity of spirit keep it right on track.\n",
        "There's much to admire in Jerry Maguire, except Jerry Maguire.\n",
        "This is a wholly unexpected film, as heady and surprising in its humor as in its emotional texture.\n",
        "Jerry Maguire is a lovely film, and an extremely fun film full of moment-to-moment observation.\n",
        "Cruise has never been this open or this funny.\n",
        "This is the kind of movie that reminds me why I started reviewing in the first place.\n",
        "You may come away from Jerry Maguire feeling a little dizzy, but once the film settles into afterthought, it provides plenty to think about.\n",
        "There are a couple of moments in Jerry Maguire when you want to hug yourself with delight.\n",
        "Cameron Crowe's overstuffed but exuberantly humane Jerry Maguire is a Tom Cruise vehicle that gives equal time to brilliantly cast co-stars in elaborately conceived roles.\n",
        "Cameron Crowe, Tom Cruise, and Cuba Gooding Jr. are salesmen, and we're consumers, buying emotional truth. That's a brave message for a commercial film to have. Too bad it's unintentional.\n",
        "Zellweger's sweetly intense performance is a star-making one, while Gooding shines in his fast-talking charm.\n",
        "Gooding does his finest work since Boyz N the Hood, positively glowing with this character's mixture of engaging brassiness and (occasionally misdirected) energy.\n",
        "Jerry Maguire is a savvy depiction of a punched-up egomaniac being mauled by the tender hands of love.\n",
        "Cruise is at the top of his form, and Gooding makes a brilliant opponent.\n",
        "Raising Arizona is no big deal, but it has a rambunctious charm.\n",
        "To their old fascination with Sunbelt pathology, to their side-winding Steadicam and pristine command of screen space, the Coens have added a robust humor, a plot that keeps outwitting expectations and a...dollop of sympathy for their forlorn kidnapers.\n",
        "The cartoon vision of southwestern tackiness doesn't cut very deep, but the mise-en-scene is packed with clever clutter.\n",
        "While film is filled with many splendid touches and plenty of yocks, it often doesn't hold together as a coherent story.\n",
        "Starting from a point of delirious excess, the film leaps into dark and virtually uncharted territory to soar like a comet.\n",
        "Like Blood Simple, it's full of technical expertise but has no life of its own.\n",
        "A wacky, happy, daring, darkly comic tale of parenting outside the law.\n",
        "What we have here is a film shot down by its own forced and mannered style.\n",
        "Makes up for its gaps in logic with its breezy tone and its technological razzledazzle.\n",
        "Right up to an ending designed to crack the sternest critical poker face, this is gourmet popcorn of the highest order.\n",
        "The performances are generally quite bad.\n",
        "Discounting his god-awful American accent, Kingsley is in fine venomous form.\n",
        "It's a Twinkie for techies, an enormously entertaining time-waster.\n",
        "It's a sometimes entertaining movie, but thin.\n",
        "If you think of Sneakers as a slick, updated Mission: Impossible, it's a lot of fun.\n",
        "In Love and War is at its best photographing stationary objects, such as architecture, trees and bedridden soldiers -- not exactly what one hopes for from a movie portraying such a vital force as Ernest Hemingway.\n",
        "The performances are overwhelmed by cinematography so gorgeous and distracting it makes the drama seem like just so much wheel spinning.\n",
        "It's all plinky-plink pianos and mewing oboes, trying to jerk those tears a little too hard. No, a lot too hard. The music is awful. Stupendously bad.\n",
        "Based on a play by Scott McPherson's who died of AIDS, it's impossible to watch the well-acted film (particularly Diane Keaton, who should get an Oscar nod) without thinking of its themees: the various approaches to love and the strength of family bonds\n",
        "Streep gives her most credible blue-collar performance to date; Keaton sidesteps saintliness to mix vulnerability and small heroics.\n",
        "Powerhouse casting and a heartbreaking history make the screen version of Marvin's Room more memorable than it otherwise would be.\n",
        "Any movie with Meryl Streep is an occasion, but when you add Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio, Hume Cronyn and Gwen Verdon, you've got an embarrassment of riches.\n",
        "There is a core of substance in Marvin's Room, and persuasive acting to back it up. Which makes it a special pity that the filmmakers didn't trust viewers to have the necessary intelligence to figure that out for themselves.\n",
        "Marvin's Room seems to exist primarily to road-test every one of your emotions.\n",
        "What begins as an apparently simple tale of sibling interaction reveals a complex web of pain, guilt, and uncertainty.\n",
        "Streep and Keaton, in their different styles, find ways to make Lee and Bessie into much more than the expression of their problems.\n",
        "Now and then, a scene will hit you in the gut, such as when Streep restyles Keaton's chemo wig. When sentiment is this honest, it's not hard to swallow.\n",
        "Rob Reiner's self-congratulatory Ghosts of Mississippi portrays Medgar Evers' slaying from the viewpoint of a white guy and can't even do a capable job of that.\n",
        "Its maker's best since 1988's Running on Empty and maybe even '82's The Verdict.\n",
        "Its idiocy is irresistible.\n",
        "Faithful fans of the MTV series will no doubt be amused. But the few newcomers who pay the price of admission likely will wonder what all the fuss has been about.\n",
        "Nothing much about Mike Judge's creation has changed.\n",
        "They distill the agony of adolescence, the queasy feeling of being trapped in a body going through monstrous changes, at the same time that they purge it of its terror.\n",
        "It's as good as any animated feature about two teenage morons could ever hope to be.\n",
        "Takes the spirit of their late night TV show and flies with it.\n",
        "Successfully brings to the big screen those no-brainer nerds who have brought laughter to living rooms around the world for nearly four years.\n",
        "Even if the movie does engender a few more chuckles than expected, where's that redneck in a truck when we need one?\n",
        "Judge's mirth translates surprisingly well to an 80-minute length, and he exploits the movies' greater scope without sacrificing the show's cheesy charm.\n",
        "Those who deplore Beavis and Butt-Head are confusing the messengers with the message.\n",
        "Mostly, we get dumb formula, not quite ironic and self-mocking enough to be hip.\n",
        "An old saying states that too much of anything isn't good, and this is a prime example.\n",
        "As the movers and shakers of this peculiar saga, Bonnaire and Huppert are unnerving and fascinating to watch together.\n",
        "Elegant, brisk and lethal in its assault on the obliviousness of the haute bourgeoise.\n",
        "Dire, tense, unpredictable, and, ultimately, satisfying.\n",
        "Chabrol's most accomplished and popular movie in decades.\n",
        "Chabrol's metier has always been tracing the cracks in the old family china, and this movie presents a brittle set, indeed.\n",
        "A tight, beautifully contained thriller that plunges four wonderful actors ... into dangerous territory.\n",
        "An unconventional thriller, its climax being the result of the meeting of two largely inert elements that become explosive only when they are mixed.\n",
        "Besides the unconvincing shift of psychic gears, the picture has no theme, no resonance, no point.\n",
        "Watching the film, you think maybe you know where it's headed. Or maybe not. Not every ceremony ends in the way we anticipate.\n",
        "The acting, as expected, is first rate, and it's unimaginable that any seasoned veteran of French cinema will let this movie get by.\n",
        "By the time Scream arrives at its final twist, Craven has done too many contortions of his own to give the finale much shock value.\n",
        "The picture is so full of cross-references, self-mockery and movies within movies (including a stalking that's recorded on video) that it can't help turning into a precious two-hour in-joke.\n",
        "Scream builds to a splattering finale that should leave genre fans highly satisfied. Here's one of the year's better thrillers.\n",
        "Scream may be a cut above the gore fests that line the dimly lit back wall at your video store, but it is a far cry from genre classics like Halloween or Craven's own Nightmare On Elm Street.\n",
        "The pic's chills are top-notch, but its underlying mockish tone won't please die-hard fans.\n",
        "The assumption that there's something inherently clever about a slasher movie making reference to both its genre and the filmmaking process is a fundamental flaw of this tiresome, blood-filled comedy.\n",
        "At last, a horror movie to shout about!\n",
        "Turns slasher flicks into slapstick.\n",
        "The best fright fest of the '90s.\n",
        "A bravura, provocative sendup of horror pictures that's also scary and gruesome yet too swift-moving to lapse into morbidity.\n",
        "Not even horror fans who can answer all this film's knowing trivia questions may be fully comfortable with such an exploitative mix.\n",
        "Whatever you do, don't close your mind to such an inventive concoction. One last time, despite all your better instincts, go ahead -- open that theater door.\n",
        "The film plays lively games with the macabre.\n",
        "Craven has expressed a desire to get out of the horror business. Maybe that's why he's set out to make more than a horror movie. He's contributing to a long tradition of reflexive films, going back as far as the turn of the century.\n",
        "While Scream has its frights, it feels more like one of those solve-the -mystery jigsaw puzzles than a real movie.\n",
        "I liked it. I liked the in-jokes and the self-aware characters. At the same time, I was aware of the incredible level of gore in this film.\n",
        "Scream is a rarity: a horror movie spoof that succeeds almost as well at provoking scares as laughs.\n",
        "Poised on the knife edge between parody and homage, Wes Craven's Scream is a deft, funny, shrewdly unsettling tribute to such slasher-exploitation thrillers as Terror Train, New Year's Evil, and Craven's own A Nightmare on Elm Street.\n",
        "...the action is richly detailed and thrillingly staged.\n",
        "...not as authentic and uncompromised as it claims to be - more of a matinee fantasy than it wants to admit - but it is probably more entertaining as a result.\n",
        "He conceives of the story as if it were a gigantic piece of mood music.\n",
        "...big, bold, and gloriously sweeping.\n",
        "Mann wasn't thinking story, he was thinking scheme. Keep the eyes and ears dazzled, he reasons, and the substance will follow.\n",
        "Painstakingly, breathtakingly re-created by director Michael Mann, this landscape makes room for heroes with principles greater than the circumference of their biceps.\n",
        "[A] smoldering corporate thriller.\n",
        "By now, George Clooney is so smooth, he could be a brand name like Gillette or Ex-Lax.\n",
        "Confident in the story's power and the moviegoers' intelligence, Gilroy uses only one explosion to own our rapt attention.\n",
        "A throwback to trim, intelligent moral thrillers like The Verdict and Absence of Malice.\n",
        "This doesn't begin to deserve the Oscar nominations it's likely to get, but I had a good time with it nonetheless.\n",
        "Smart and exciting, Michael Clayton takes the audience on a ride whose pleasures almost sneak up on you and are all the more satisfying because of it.\n",
        "Stop printing the ballots. Don't waste money on those \"for your consideration\" Oscar ads. There is but one contender for best supporting actor this year, and it is Tom Wilkinson in Michael Clayton.\n",
        "Full of plausible characters who are capable of surprising - and surpassing - your expectations.\n",
        "One of my favorite movies of the year.\n",
        "This is unequivocally a thriller for adults\n",
        "While the plot is complex in the telling, it unfolds onscreen with propulsive fascination.\n",
        "This is Gilroy's first film as director; I can't wait to see what he's got next.\n",
        "The ultimate showcase for the defining male lead of our time.\n",
        "It's about issues of personal responsibility and moral duty.\n",
        "There are more than ample rewards for discerning adults: Some of the best dialogue in a recent movie and a gallery of unforgettable performances.\n",
        "Every performance in this film is spot-on.\n",
        "The movie's plot may be familiar, but its hero is a unique and memorable creation.\n",
        "If Michael Clayton's particular mix of law and commerce gets a little murky, that murkiness also gives the film a shadowy aura.\n",
        "Harking back to wince-inducing sequels like The Sting II and Texasville, this DOA boo-boo needlessly expands upon Terms of Endearment.\n",
        "There are many ... instances when you want to run screaming from Elsinore Castle.\n",
        "With his handsome and compelling Hamlet, Kenneth Branagh brings the Bard's greatest tragedy passionately alive on the screen.\n",
        "This Hamlet may not be perfect, but it is perfectly engrossing.\n",
        "As star and ringmaster, Branagh gets to the heart of Hamlet and goes to admirable lengths to take his audience there, too.\n",
        "The film equivalent of a lushly illustrated coffee-table book.\n",
        "I have seen dozens of versions of this play (either on screen or on stage), and none has ever held me in such a grip of awe.\n",
        "By looking to the box office and the classroom with equal respect, [Branagh] has kept himself a friend of Shakespeare.\n",
        "Kenneth Branagh directs and stars in a vibrant, full-text, full-hearted film from Shakespeare's most complex tragedy.\n",
        "Branagh confirms what was known from the opening shot of Henry V: he has fine cinematic skills.\n",
        "Glorious as it is, this unexpurgated workout is ultimately a movie of moments.\n",
        "Every little triumph seems to inspire in Branagh some accompanying act of bad taste or judgment.\n",
        "Branagh's version moved me, entertained me and made me feel for the first time at home in that doomed royal court.\n",
        "A vigorous, four-hour adaptation that's 100 percent Shakespeare and 100 percent cinema.\n",
        "If Son were as strong in its storytelling as its characters are in their convictions, it would be more than well-acted political soap.\n",
        "Invest some patience and you'll be richly rewarded with rolling frontier vistas, butterscotch sunsets and a sweet, melancholy romance that will sneak up on you and grab your heart.\n",
        "A troubling film about the need to be wanted.\n",
        "There is in The Mother a rich understanding of where old age takes you. Along with the myth that seniors don't have sex drives, the film dispels a larger one: that the years bring wisdom.\n",
        "It challenges you to figure out how you feel about the people on the screen -- emotionally, intellectually, morally.\n",
        "The Mother never fails to engage.\n",
        "It sounds like the stuff of soap operas or bad porn, but Kureishi's script is too intelligent and empathetic to titillate.\n",
        "Uses the surface familiarity of its situation ... to smuggle an elegantly carved Trojan horse full of messy emotional spillover into the theatre.\n",
        "The complications of its story are found in the deep complexities of emotions and family relationships.\n",
        "Bracing but superb.\n",
        "You may not enjoy The Mother (I certainly didn't), but it's a movie so heavy on truth, its spell cannot be denied.\n",
        "Though their selfishness is repellent, the characters feel strikingly real.\n",
        "It shows how people play a role and grow comfortable with it, and how that role is confused with the real person inside. And then it shows the person inside, frightened and pitiful and fighting for survival.\n",
        "A drama that's unafraid of pain, complexity and ambiguity.\n",
        "It neither reassures nor insults its audience. These days, a film that doesn't insult your intelligence is absolutely refreshing.\n",
        "Reid's magnificent portrayal of the indomitable May has been insufficiently appreciated both here and in England. She is nothing short of uncanny.\n",
        "A soap opera with guts: a movie that takes a familiar situation ... and turns it into something rawer and more sexy.\n",
        "[Michell] shows what can be accomplished on a small budget with a brilliant script and a cast that rarely makes a false move.\n",
        "A well-intentioned but flawed British drama that presents a sexual relationship between a sixtysome-thing widow and a much-younger man, then sidesteps nearly all the issues it's pretending to address.\n",
        "It's an awkward, discomfiting film, at times floridly melodramatic, at others downright gamy, and yet it gets at truths of human behavior that few movies think to touch.\n",
        "Deneuve gives one of her best performances ever, though she's not exactly the movie's focus. Of the many pleasures here, one is trying to guess just who the dramatic focal point is.\n",
        "Techine involves us in a subtle, gradual process of discovery; each piece changes the relationship of the others. He is so wise about these criminals, he makes the bad guys in most American films look like cartoon characters.\n",
        "With one of the most dazzling screen chassis in years, Evita is definitely worth a look -- maybe even two. But don't look under the hood.\n",
        "Intelligent but exasperating, its monotonous tone will wear down even viewers who started out in its corner.\n",
        "For the most part, Walkabout is an involving, occasionally hypnotic, motion picture.\n",
        "Is it a parable about noble savages and the crushed spirits of city dwellers? That's what the film's surface seems to suggest, but I think it's also about something deeper and more elusive: The mystery of communication.\n",
        "Roeg intercuts images of modern life with the lushness of nature -- offering a stunning fable about the importance of respecting the earth.\n",
        "Murder is a fairly diverting game of whodunit, like a big-screen version of Clue, until it sinks into routine thriller antics and wraps up preposterously.\n",
        "The spirited cast of Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Monty Pythonites John Cleese and Michael Palin is willing. But this tossed-together trifle about an unassuming British zoo taken over by a money-mad Murdochian media mogul is weak.\n",
        "Fasten your seat belts, folks. It's going to be a cliche-cluttered ride.\n",
        "There's definitely more than three rings' worth of death-defying feats, high-flying slapstick and even a few well-trained animal acts.\n",
        "These vampires have no teeth -- hell, they don't even fly.\n",
        "'Your incompetence is most taxing,' says the chief vampire (Bill Nighy). A line that pretty much nails this rusty Blade.\n",
        "The sort of movie in which the head vampire telegraphs his evil by using a cell phone and dressing like the Kinks' Ray Davies in the early '80s.\n",
        "I've been waiting a long time to see a Shakespearean werewolf vampire movie and here it is.\n",
        "125 minutes is a long time to stare at a movie that's basically in bleached blue-and-white with occasional splotches of brick red.\n",
        "By any reasonable standard, this dark vampire epic -- all massive overacting, cologne-commercial design and sexy cat suits -- sucks.\n",
        "It needs a wooden stake and a silver bullet through its script.\n",
        "For all its slick, neo-noir style, Underworld brings very little that's new to a hoary genre, except for the cliches and conventions of other hoary genres.\n",
        "Features some of the year's most laughable dialogue.\n",
        "Wiseman ... seems vastly more concerned with making a fashion statement than scaring the bejesus out of us.\n",
        "A weirdly compelling blend of corny sentiment and bloodthirsty ballet.\n",
        "Could use script transfusion, or at least a few quarts of levity.\n",
        "Somewhere out there, Dracula is turning over in his grave.\n",
        "Pure hooey, but it certainly has a sense of humor (at least it seems like humor).\n",
        "The whole thing's more art-directed than directed, and the actors are clearly on their own.\n",
        "Sometimes talent and good looks just aren't enough -- [Beckinsale] lacks the movie star presence needed to give life to a supernatural hero in a B-genre film.\n",
        "The movie is stylish and cruel, and mightily entertaining for certain covens out there.\n",
        "A vampire film for the new millennium -- bold, galvanizing and darkly stylish.\n",
        "It's hard to recall a more sexless vampire flick.\n",
        "A noisy, tiresome affair that can't manage one moment of wit or real tension.\n",
        "Farley, a real lightweight compared to such late, great predecessors John Belushi and John Candy, brings none of Belushi's edgy intelligence, nor Candy's gentle pathos to this comic caricature.\n",
        "A satisfying and sturdy vehicle for Farley that ought to please his fans, youngsters especially.\n",
        "A silly movie, with silly jokes and a silly story. But the talents at work in it are not silly.\n",
        "The humor the premise throws off is supposed to be funny. It just isn't.\n",
        "Farley might want to be like John Candy, but, while Candy knew how to make an audience laugh, Farley keeps missing the mark.\n",
        "This formulaic tale of a ninja klutz trying to break a counterfeit ring can be recommended only to undemanding children, and even they may find it a drag.\n",
        "A renter with some mileage on it.\n",
        "By-the-numbers doesn't begin to describe how cliche-ridden Randy Feldman's script is.\n",
        "Murphy is fresh, as usual, but Metro is not.\n",
        "Despite Murphy's consistently strong performance, Metro meanders into a rather unremarkable cat-and-mouse territory.\n",
        "Anyone seeking a fresh characterization of clever plot twist ought not to buy a ride of this Murphy vehicle.\n",
        "The big action scenes are cleverly staged and Eddie Murphy is back on his game again, with a high-energy performance and crisp dialogue.\n",
        "Metro is about as generic as action pictures come.\n",
        "If H.G. Wells had a time machine and could take a look at his kin's reworked version, what would he say? 'It looks good, Sonny, but you missed the point.'\n",
        "One of those staggeringly well-produced, joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next, hastily, emptily.\n",
        "If it's remembered at all, it will be as a time capsule of early-21st-century blockbuster cowardice and redundancy.\n",
        "They gave The Time Machine a major overhaul and ended up with a clunker.\n",
        "In the new film, it's personal tragedy that provokes the journey, not social upheaval or even scientific curiosity -- which, predictably, makes for a story that's at once more familiar and less interesting.\n",
        "Amazingly stilted before accelerating into its exciting finish.\n",
        "The film is weirdly disjointed and uncertain as to tone.\n",
        "Simon Wells, whose other films include the animated The Prince of Egypt and Balto, manages to gut all the gee-whiz from the practically foolproof time-travel genre -- despite being H.G.'s real-life great-grandson.\n",
        "Midway through the movie, just when it seems that it might amount to something interesting, we're suddenly transported to the set of a very bad remake of Planet Of The Apes.\n",
        "... unlike the shiny machine at its center, its timing is off, and it never quite soars.\n",
        "... there's something wrong with a time-travel movie that allows an audience's interest to drift so that we have time to worry over where he's parked, and whether he remembered to take his key.\n",
        "... an agreeable time-wasting device -- but George Pal's low-tech 1960 version still rules the epochs.\n",
        "The worst news isn't that this Time Machine is lacking in humanity. It's that screenwriter John Logan has been given the job of writing the next Star Trek movie, Nemesis. That is bad news for the Enterprise gang.\n",
        "Not exactly H.G. Wells, but sturdy and effective.\n",
        "Everything else that the filmmakers have done in their thoughtless, lazy way to 'improve' the original formula serves only to leach the drama and excitement out of the underlying story.\n",
        "The Time Machine isn't so much an adaptation of H.G. Wells' seminal novel as it is an appropriation. The film borrows liberally from the book, but doesn't treat it with much respect or affection or even understanding.\n",
        "The Time Machine is stupid -- too stupid for the impressive special effects or the competently directed action sequences to wash away the bitter taste.\n",
        "The Strangers has a couple of scares, but it's not anywhere near as frightening as advertised. The creepy folks of the title are more fumbling than fiendish.\n",
        "This suspense film by first-time writer-director Bryan Bertino initially squeezes some surprisingly effective scares out of familiar elements. Sadly, the scenario quickly becomes attenuated and unbelievable.\n",
        "At least it's short.\n",
        "A sadistic, unmotivated home-invasion flick.\n",
        "Don't let the attractive cast, the slick look or the 'inspired by true events' nonsense mislead you. The Strangers is a despicable and mean-spirited practical joke.\n",
        "Kind of like what The Shining might be if you took out the ESP. And the ghosts. And the chilling atmosphere. So call it The Sucking.\n",
        "I like watching snakes eat mice just as much as the next fella, maybe even more, but The Strangers turns the gobble-'em-up into an ordeal. It's a fraud from start to finish.\n",
        "With no plot to speak of, no character development whatsoever, no theme and precious little intrigue, what we have here is simply a pileup of effects. And not especially special effects.\n",
        "Bertino relies too heavily on occasionally nonsensical terror tricks that every horror buff has seen a million times since John Carpenter's Halloween set the standard for domestic fright-night mayhem.\n",
        "Let's give writer-director Bryan Bertino credit. He knows how to frame a shot to make characters seem vulnerable. Now for his next trick, he just needs to turn his talents toward something that isn't repulsive.\n",
        "It's intense but not necessarily fun and may disappoint less sophisticated horror fans. However, for die-hard supporters of unsettling peeks into the dark side of human nature, this is a welcome excursion.\n",
        "Fans of the 'pitiless/merciless killers' school of horror should get a jolt out of The Strangers, a harrowing real-time tale of an assault on a remote country home.\n",
        "Writer and first-time director Bryan Bertino wastes his taut, tense premise -- two lovers, three villains, one house -- by depending on wearingly familiar tricks.\n",
        "Unfolding with an almost startling lack of self-awareness, young filmmaker Bryan Bertino's debut is such a careful, straight-faced knockoff of '70s exploitation films it plays like a parody.\n",
        "Every silence, pause and sudden noise startles -- and the results, frankly, are more frightening than the graphic torture scenes in movies like Hostel and Saw.\n",
        "After a while, the suspense starts seeping out of The Strangers, because you realize that's all there's going to be to the movie.\n",
        "A frightfully effective chiller.\n",
        "It sounds stupid enough, and ultimately is, but the director, Bryan Bertino, stages The Strangers' early scenes with spooky panache.\n",
        "It's an efficiently made, appropriately terrifying film, downright minimalist in approach and all the more horrifying for it. It's so basic it's believable.\n",
        "A $100 million piece of piffle.\n",
        "A one-joke sketch that doesn't work as a feature.\n",
        "Cage is the only actor allowed to do riffs on his assigned part, something he takes full advantage of; the others are stuck with their two-dimensional satirical profiles, which grow increasingly tiresome and unyielding.\n",
        "A hhandicapped satirical farce whose roots are not in life but in other, better movies and sitcoms.\n",
        "A very funny little film with big pleasures, and a most promising debut.\n",
        "Although the movie strives mightily to teach its lesson, which is that you cannot judge a man by the color of his skin, the humor is undermined by the sadness of the basic situation.\n",
        "Cage is a font of funny character weirdness. This movie marks the least of his offerings. Jackson, as the relative straight man, has little to work with.\n",
        "If nothing else, at least the movie offers laughs without being offensive.\n",
        "As the outsider who courts the mentally ill Mary Stuart Masterson, Johnny Depp renders a startling performance that elevates the romantic fable way above its writing and directing shortcomings; look for the young Julianne Moore in a small part.\n",
        "It's acted out in the secondary emotional register of the glass menagerie: whimsical, delicate, idiosyncratic, barmy.\n",
        "Mr. Depp may look nothing like Buster Keaton, but there are times when he genuinely seems to become the Great Stone Face, bringing Keaton's mannerisms sweetly and magically to life.\n",
        "The cast is defeated by a cloying Barry Berman script that Jeremiah Chechik directs with the same flair for the obvious he brought to National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.\n",
        "The movie suggests that love and magic can overcome madness, and for at least the length of the film I was prepared to accept that. Much of the credit for that goes to Depp...\n",
        "Riddled with insufferably contrived zaniness ... it deals as deeply with mental illness as The Sound of Music explored the genocidal advance of the Third Reich.\n",
        "[Chechik] has crafted Benny & Joon not as a seamless whole but as a tumble of scenes. Unfortunately, too many of them are inspired by Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton, and they seem to spill from the screen like Bozos from a kiddie car.\n",
        "Benny & Joon tries to get by on quirkiness alone, and, while something this offbeat frequently carries a unique kind of appeal, it needs stronger characters than Sam and Joon.\n",
        "Prefontaine gets to the finish line in reasonable shape despite plenty of sloppy running along the way.\n",
        "Disappointingly colorless and squeaky-clean.\n",
        "Though it is always pleasant and agreeable, this film has the bland and undemanding texture that characterizes movies made for network TV.\n",
        "James tries too hard to bring closure to Pre's life, and, as a result, strays a little too far into melodrama. The tearful reminiscences at the end, not to mention some of the stuff at the funeral, lay it on thickly.\n",
        "The Super-16mm film stock gives the film a grainy look that blends in artfully with the vintage videotape of ABC's '72 Olympics coverage.\n",
        "Even through Prefontaine's obviousness, we feel its force.\n",
        "Here is a sports movie in the tradition of the best sportswriting, where athletes are portrayed warts and all. You do not have to be nice to win races, but you have to be good.\n",
        "With hypnotic blue eyes and dirty blond hair, Leto captures the rock-star style Prefontaine affected, and he looks natural in fiery performances on the track, as well as off, where Pre affected a brash, confrontational style.\n",
        "A ham-fisted, fitfully amusing lark that quickly runs aground.\n",
        "By the end, this soporific comedy makes 105 minutes feel more like a two-year hitch.\n",
        "A useless movie. Not funny, suspenseful, moving or even offensive enough to want to torpedo. Just devoid of any conceivable value.\n",
        "Leaky PT-boat of a comedy.\n",
        "I didn't laugh once, not even giggle.\n",
        "Suitable only for movie-goers who have undergone frontal lobotomies.\n",
        "As an Oscar nominee, Kolya lacks the cinematic dazzle of France's Ridicule. But no one can claim that its emotional clout isn't earned.\n",
        "An engaging look at a mangy day in the lives of two junkies trying to kick, Gridlock'd would have been a good mid-level B.O. performer even without the interest surrounding it, due to the recent death of co-star Tupac Shakur.\n",
        "The &#64257;lm has a fairly uninteresting narrative motor in its thriller subplot, but hits on an edgy black comic tone for Stretch and Spoon's increasingly pained dealings with the unsympathetic representatives of authority.\n",
        "The film seems so fresh it's almost possible to forget that it is a fraud in its description of the culture of hard drugs.\n",
        "The movie's appeal lies largely in its capacity for surprise, riffing off tired characters and pooped genres to produce, intermittently at least, a fresh new tone. Call it junkie humour.\n",
        "Cast against type as the gentler of two musician junkies trying to burrow through the bureaucracy to enter a rehab clinic in Detroit, Shakur has the relaxed screen presence of a young Wesley Snipes and plays perfectly off the delirious Tim Roth.\n",
        "A surprisingly light-hearted comedy about what happens when two self-imposed exiles from society decide to go straight and look to the system for a little help.\n",
        "This is grim material, but surprisingly entertaining, and it is more cause to mourn the recent death of Shakur, who gives his best performance as Spoon, a musician who wants to get off drugs.\n",
        "Gridlock'd is refreshing because it's different. The subject matter isn't new, but the approach and tone are.\n",
        "A smart, well-made buddy film about two junkies desperate to kick the habit.\n",
        "This 1997 comedy may be amusing if you feel a pressing need to feel superior to somebody, but the aim is too broad and scattershot to add up to much beyond an acknowledgment of small-town desperation.\n",
        "A madcap gem.\n",
        "The comedy has the slow burn of a richly nuanced and non-judgmental character study.\n",
        "Where This Is Spinal Tap took rock music and the media as its focus - fat, juicy targets just asking to be lampooned - Guest's target here is small-town provincials.\n",
        "A very funny, very unusual ensemble comedy that falls somewhere between slapdash and brilliant, an improvised comedy with more hits than misses.\n",
        "Priceless.\n",
        "A sly and gleeful comedy showcase that pokes clever fun at the American musical, amateur theatricals and anything else that's not nailed down.\n",
        "The originality and audacity of the film, written by Guest and Levy, is what holds us. They never lose the conceit that the documentary filmmakers, and not themselves, are the ones who made this movie.\n",
        "The nonstop amusing mockumentary Waiting for Guffman does to small-town acting troupes what This Is Spinal Tap did to heavy-metal bands.\n",
        "There is such a thing as comic momentum, and Guest has a good sense of what that means. Comic momentum doesn't refer to nonstop jokes, but to an atmosphere that is always ripe for humor.\n",
        "Attention is paid not simply to funny characters and punch lines, but to small nudges at human nature.\n",
        "Once our disbelief gets suspended, a spell is definitely cast.\n",
        "The outcome of this movie isn't exactly Hollywood material, but it stirs thoughts and feelings that outlast all too many American studio releases.\n",
        "Simple, powerful, convincing.\n",
        "The performances that Bodrov drew from a mostly amateur cast of Muslim villagers -- most of whom have never seen running hot water, let alone a movie camera -- are alone worth the price of admission.\n",
        "A thoughtful and moving film about war.\n",
        "Bodrov's movie turns this barren no man's land into an extraordinary stage.\n",
        "Lyrical and evocative, Prisoner of the Mountains represents a balanced and telling examination of the absurdity of war.\n",
        "Manages to be sweet and likable, largely because Kwapis directs the actors well and treats the sub-Lubitsch material as if he actually believed in it.\n",
        "Listening to Fran Drescher's nasal squawk for an entire movie is the price you'll pay to see The Beautician and the Beast. Imagine having your ear canal scoured with Brillo. Only more abrasive.\n",
        "Linklater's finessing of acting ensembles is very proficient -- again.\n",
        "Pic exists solely to showcase Leguizamo's wild and crazy antics, which are very much an acquired taste.\n",
        "When Mr. Leguizamo isn't doing third-rate ethnic parody, he is wallowing in scatological jokes that are so poorly prepared and executed that they make similar antics by Mr. Carrey play like classic routines.\n",
        "Talented and versatile actor-comedian John Leguizamo indulges himself so totally with incessant mugging, mimicking and all-around showing off that he begins to wear out his welcome before the opening credit sequence is over.\n",
        "This film is utterly without discipline or focus in a way that -- to one's shame --one eventually finds oddly endearing.\n",
        "Obviously, someone must have told Leguizamo he's a comic genius. Whoever did that isn't his friend.\n",
        "It's the kind of movie where every paying customer deserves to receive a handwritten apology from the producers.\n",
        "Take away the ethnic/pregnancy angles, and we've seen this premise countless times -- all the way back to the spate of post-World War II romances about returning veterans and the mates they married in a blink.\n",
        "The experience of seeing the film is subduing; the movie plays in a muted key.\n",
        "The plot is a doomsday version of Bill Clinton's Paula Jones problem, but the theme is impending mortality--settling scores before time's up.\n",
        "Doesn't rank with Eastwood's best work as actor/director, but it's nevertheless solidly enjoyable.\n",
        "Mr. Hackman languishes in the smallish role of a White House buffoon, with Judy Davis equally cartoonish as his witchy chief of staff.\n",
        "A first-rate thriller about arrogance at the top, a showdown between two kinds of Americans: the evil, omnipotent bureaucrat and the enterprising, mind-his- own-business loner.\n",
        "Ultimately, this is a thriller in vain search of credible thrills.\n",
        "Almost a drawing room thriller, unhurried and genteel but enlivened with suspense and surprising bursts of sly, even biting, humor.\n",
        "Unintentional yuks litter an otherwise somber political thriller adapted from David Baldacci's novel.\n",
        "The picture might have gotten by if Eastwood had given it some impudent wit. But he directs to the rhythm of his facial muscles.\n",
        "Not many thrillers slow down to notice relationships, but this one does.\n",
        "A fairly routine thriller that gets high marks as a result of tight pacing and top-notch acting.\n",
        "The subplots involving D'Angelo and Newton and Ethan Embry -- the Griswolds' son, who can't stop winning -- have their charms.\n",
        "A tepid fourth entry in the popular 1980s series that is decidedly showing its age.\n",
        "To the legions who have returned as losers from the glitzy playgrounds of the Nevada desert can now be added the people responsible for Vegas Vacation.\n",
        "I'll lay you 3-to-1 odds that by the end of this flick even fans will be thinking that this wasn't a trip worth taking.\n",
        "There is nothing more memorable about Vegas Vacation than the flatness of the writing in Elisa Bell's script and the uninspired direction of first-timer Stephen Kessler.\n",
        "The first half hour in particular is clogged with wheezing routines that appear to have no punchlines.\n",
        "Full of jokes that fall flat.\n",
        "The film's only life is provided by Randy Quaid, back as Ellen's redneck cousin.\n",
        "Chase unrolls his tired collection of mugs and stumbles, while some truly funny performers - particularly Sid Caesar and the usually reliable Wallace Shawn - are wasted in do-nothing roles.\n",
        "Why, if [Chevy] Chase is such a funny guy, does he make such unfunny movies?\n",
        "Retracing overly traveled roads.\n",
        "Reiner benefits from divine intervention from no less than Miss M herself. Bette Midler flings the usual zingers with fang-baring zeal in a part that plays to her brassy strengths.\n",
        "Visually arresting, the movie does keep you going until the finale confirms suspicions that Lynch has painted himself into a corner.\n",
        "Rhames' gravity and grace, Voight's pinched anguish as he wills himself to do right, the moving work of actors like Don Cheadle and Esther Rolle do much to redeem this film for human if not historical reality.\n",
        "Although it increasingly succumbs to a tendency toward conventional movie heroics, John Singleton's fourth film tells a story of rare interest and tragedy...\n",
        "The need to bear witness against atrocity, to testify that something wicked this way came, is the powerful drive that animates Rosewood, the story of an American tragedy so horrific no one talked about it for more than half a century.\n",
        "Rosewood is startling, infuriating, painful history played out as a not-very-satisfying, overly ambitious and overlong movie.\n",
        "Neither the film's smug white bigots nor its uniformly noble blacks are well served by such oversimplification.\n",
        "It's doubtful a viewer of any race will be unshaken by this horrifying look back during Black History Month.\n",
        "If the movie were simply the story of this event, it would be no more than a sad record. What makes it more is the way it shows how racism breeds and feeds, and is taught by father to son.\n",
        "An epic that stands alone in the latter weeks of a dismal movie winter.\n",
        "Although perhaps familiar in its outer trappings, Pacino's fine work is the key to the film succeeding to the extent that it does.\n",
        "A tense, sharp and compelling character study, Newell's film is a worthy addition to the Mob-movie canon.\n",
        "Unfortunately, the story isn't inventive and Newell's methodical approach to it verges on monotony.\n",
        "A first-class Mafia thriller that is also, in its way, a love story.\n",
        "In the tired figure of Lefty, manifest in the craggy icon of Pacino, our sympathies are definitely enlisted, and the theme rings a poignant note.\n",
        "Pacino and Depp are a match made in acting heaven, riffing off each other with astonishing subtlety and wit.\n",
        "Though the outline of what the film has tried to do is visible, so little feels at stake emotionally that anyone intending to care about these characters would be well advised, for want of a better phrase, to simply fhuggedaboudit.\n",
        "Depp is as good as I've seen him, and Pacino is simply astonishing.\n",
        "The movie has many human qualities and contains what will be remembered as one of Pacino's finest scenes.\n",
        "A consistently absorbing and intelligent adult entertainment.\n",
        "You get something far richer, if more unsettling, here than conventional crime drama's romanticism and easy analogies.\n",
        "For all its treacheries, twists and turns, nothing really comes as a surprise.\n",
        "Takes us into a world that the movies frequently open to us, but somehow this trip seems more real and less glamorized than most.\n",
        "An affirmation that the director, Mike Newell, has a gift for talkative, intelligent films that make his actors shine.\n",
        "Pacino cans the showboating bluster and gives a gently nuanced portrait of a simple man in decline.\n",
        "Cuaron fulfills the promise of futuristic fiction; characters do not wear strange costumes or visit the moon, and the cities are not plastic hallucinations, but look just like today, except tired and shabby.\n",
        "You feel as if you're accompanying a war photographer who's lost a bet. Slogging unflinchingly through humanity's worst hours, the movie laces the narrative's forays into science-fiction grandstanding with a gut-wrenching dynamic.\n",
        "What I find particularly irksome about it is its pseudo-humanism and its calculating political correctness.\n",
        "It's a wow.\n",
        "A superior sci-fi thriller and the best doomsday drama since 28 Days Later.\n",
        "Despite the bleakness of its vision, Children of Men is also thrilling, both for its groundbreaking style (there are action sequences here unlike any filmed before) and its complex, vividly realized ideas.\n",
        "Cuaron does lowdown takes on high concept better than anyone; no matter what genre he touches, he brings grit and loose-limbed humor along with the hand-held camera jangles.\n",
        "Darkly poetic throughout, the film starts with an explosion and ends drifting in fog with no clear resolution in sight. How brave and oddly satisfying.\n",
        "Fasten your seat belt; you're in for a bumpy, provocative ride.\n",
        "You can see it now or wait 20 years until the movie has found a niche among equally visionary movies that have the capacity to compel, alarm and shake things up.\n",
        "Based on a novel by British mystery writer P.D. James, Children of Men is a filmmaking feat. In the midst of mayhem, director Alfonso Cuaron delivers subtle and jarring images, while exploring complex emotional rhythms.\n",
        "[A] dark, terrifying and sometimes very funny film.\n",
        "A stylish mish-mash of dystopian cliches.\n",
        "At times the film is so supercharged that it glosses over the story's thematic richness and turns into a very high-grade action picture. But if that's the worst thing you can say about a movie, you're doing all right.\n",
        "Cuaron also pulls us deep into the engrossing universe he has created. There is a stark absence of gadget porn in this futuristic adventure; the most advanced device we see is a video game, innovation at its most trivial.\n",
        "Thrilling, important, and invigoratingly bleak, Children of Men is one of the very best movies to come out in 2006.\n",
        "Even if you don't buy the main conceit, the scumbled texture of the movie makes it feel not just plausible but recognizable, and Cuaron takes care never to paint the future as consolingly different.\n",
        "Bloated adaptation of P.D. James's thoughtful, compact novel.\n",
        "While it's best to know as little as possible about this movie going into the theater, the story is so fast-paced that you won't be thinking about this review or any other.\n",
        "A second viewing, which Children of Men richly rewards, deepens our understanding.\n",
        "Gently humorous and moving.\n",
        "Roughly half of Tim Allen's latest comedy is hilarious-stupid, and the rest is monotonous-stupid.\n",
        "Simple truths are often the most effective, but in this instance they are only banal and mildly amusing.\n",
        "Typically for Disney, the villains aren't made of very stern stuff, nor indeed is fey spear-carrying Mimi-Siku.\n",
        "Mildly caustic, sentimental and slow.\n",
        "Huntington is wonderful at conveying Mimi's combination of naivete and intelligence, and Allen is a marvel.\n",
        "I for one am sick and tired of the unappealingly unoriginal fare that Disney releases on a constant basis.\n",
        "Jungle 2 Jungle still finds time to appreciate Mr. Allen's easy way with a child actor, an audience or a heavily tranquilized pet cat.\n",
        "No one is allowed to think in this movie. Not one single event in the entire plot can possibly take place unless every character in the cast has brains made of Bac-o-Bits.\n",
        "For all his talent, Martin Short has been consistently snakebitten in his choice of movies, a streak now extended by Disney's Jungle 2 Jungle.\n",
        "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, Jungle 2 Jungle.\n",
        "The two leads click throughout in a movie that's just good enough to engender curiosity over filmmaker Witcher's follow-up effort.\n",
        "A generic suspenser that doesn't taste bad at first bite but becomes increasingly hard to swallow.\n",
        "This insufferable romance-adventure includes vague comedy as well as unintentional humor, and its target audience seems to be preadolescents who won't notice the calculated enthusiasm with which it sidesteps sexuality.\n",
        "Eminently forgettable.\n",
        "Love redeems this profiteer; it also renders him conventional.\n",
        "Reinvention in the hands of Hollywood is seldom cause for celebration.\n",
        "There isn't a contemporary film actor more crafty than Val Kilmer -- or one who reveals less of his true self. That's why Kilmer is so perfectly cast as Simon Templar, the master thief and elusive disguise artist of The Saint.\n",
        "More entertaining than Mission: Impossible or the last Bond film, Goldeneye, it brings back the humour and sang-froid that makes the genre work.\n",
        "Whereas something like Clear and Present Danger was briskly all of a piece, \"The Saint\" has difficulty making us believe that its diverse elements belong in the same motion picture.\n",
        "A soulless piece of claptrap.\n",
        "Compared with the sensational stunts and special effects in the Bond series, The Saint seems positively leisurely.\n",
        "The Saint is lightly entertaining, but there's very little here worth getting excited about.\n",
        "A piece of mass-market movie bubblegum that stretches incredulity and then snaps apart.\n",
        "The Saint is all glitz and comic-book spy plot with no more than a passing hint that Templar has a real personality behind the disguises.\n",
        "Anyone looking for a religious experience at the multiplex this weekend will do better checking out Dennis Rodman's hair hues in Double Team.\n",
        "[Noyce] keeps things moving at a kinetic, involving pace.\n",
        "Loud, frantic, ridiculously overproduced and featuring a preening performance by Val Kilmer as a supposedly brilliant master of disguise, The Saint is sheer overkill.\n",
        "This tough-to-peg whodunit keeps you going for two hours, despite a few James Bond-ish (or Jane Bond-ish) turns that play less preposterously than you might assume were they to be divulged.\n",
        "Ultimately, Crash succeeds in spite of itself. Its color war starts to feel obvious and schematic. Its coincidences and cliches become like a pileup on the 405 freeway, but there it is -- you find yourself rubbernecking and can't manage to look away.\n",
        "Haggis moves seamlessly between all these stories and has structured them in such a way that his characters reach a crisis point simultaneously, followed by melancholy clarity.\n",
        "It's smart, therefore, that Haggis has written such novel, precisely observed, often unpleasant characters as the ones Bullock, Dillon, and Cheadle inhabit.\n",
        "Enjoy the wonderful performances by a cast very committed to the cause.\n",
        "An already over-eventful narrative -- what, another crash? -- teeters into melodramatic implausibility.\n",
        "[Has a] spirited and talented ensemble cast, which Haggis directs with sensitivity.\n",
        "Too facile.\n",
        "Haggis's drama is about much more than interlocking front-end collisions. It's about the way we learn, often badly, about one another and how it may take a bad confrontation to peel away the misperceptions.\n",
        "This is the rare American film really about something, and almost all the performances are riveting. It asks tough questions, and lets its audience struggle with the answers.\n",
        "The best parts of Crash are as good as they are because they confront us with behaviour we might be capable of under the same circumstances. And we're not bad people. Are we?\n",
        "And so Crash raises the question: If racism is so pervasive in our society, why do we need such an elaborately contrived plot to drive home the message? In other words: How many racists does it take to screw in the point?\n",
        "Crash, Paul Haggis' flawed but riveting tale of racism in contemporary Los Angeles, has moments so powerful they're instantly seared into your memory; you'll watch without blinking, barely breathing.\n",
        "Its emotional lows and wicked below-the-belt punches make it a soul-searching film, a manipulative movie with a lot of stars and a writer-director staying on message throughout: We need to know each other better than this.\n",
        "Crash isn't set half-a-century ago, in some place of dusty roads and Skoal-spitting sheriffs. It takes place now, in Los Angeles, that most modern of American cities.\n",
        "Contrived, obvious and overstated, Crash is basically just one white man's righteous attempt to make other white people feel as if they've confronted the problem of racism head-on.\n",
        "An ambitious and often wonderful movie, an expansive look at urban life -- the fractious, noisy whole of it -- filled with witty, biting and insightful writing.\n",
        "Haggis bends back one full day to unravel the tangled threads leading to the crash, and, in turn, the tangle justifies the existence of his varied and polyglot ensemble.\n",
        "One of the finest American movies to engage our diverse richness and our casual and not-so-casual ethnic hostility.\n",
        "Characters come straight from the assembly line of screenwriting archetypes, and too often they act in ways that archetypes, rather than human beings, do.\n",
        "The characters and individual dramas remain interesting in a personal way, but the overall conception of Crash is hackneyed.\n",
        "A spirited cast, including old pros Amma Meara and younger talent Parker Posey and Stanley Tucci, elevates this claustrophobic sitcom (most of whiche is set in a car) into something fluffier and funnier than it actually is.\n",
        "Close to an ideal jumping-off point for Carrey, who spends the better part of an hour grotesquely physicalizing his scummy lawyer's struggle with being obliged to utter cold, hard facts.\n",
        "Pretty rudimentary, but it keeps Carrey's occasional over-exuberance in check and delivers likeable, effective, but decidedly mainstream comedy.\n",
        "Like Robin Williams, Carrey has learned to do his side-splitting shtick in character. He's not only under control, but funnier than ever as the truth-impaired Fletcher Reede.\n",
        "...Liar Liar stands to make a liar out of those who predicted that Carrey's career was on the skids.\n",
        "...Jim Carrey makes a wild and remarkable comeback to cheerfulness...\n",
        "As Carrey's celebrated rubber does its patented act, the flick turns into a gyrational marathon -- mildly funny but seriously exhausting.\n",
        "...as Liar Liar proves one more time, there is probably no more consistently funny performer working in film today.\n",
        "Truth be told, the rapid-fire Liar, directed with unfussy flair by Tom Shadyac, is a one-joke movie. But it's a doozy.\n",
        "I am gradually developing a suspicion, or perhaps it is a fear, that Jim Carrey is growing on me.\n",
        "All-in-all, Liar Liar is pretty good fun, and it represents one of Carrey's most entertaining movies to date.\n",
        "It's a magnificent comic experience.\n",
        "This is Carrey's most mature (and mainstream) comic turn, with flashes of introspection and tenderness.\n",
        "Its premise is flimsy, but its payoff is riotously funny.\n",
        "Well into his tumultuous career, Mr. Carrey finally turns up in a straightforward comic vehicle, and the results are much wilder and funnier than this mundane material should have allowed.\n",
        "Selena surmounts its connect-the-dots approach to its heroine's life to create an appealing, energetic look at a too-briefly soaring musical star.\n",
        "By the end of the film, Selena has been all but canonized.\n",
        "Nava, who started his feature-film career with El Norte, is a good director who invariably finds a strong rapport with his actors. He's not much of a writer, though, and he should think twice about creating dialogue for his future projects.\n",
        "Missing is a sense of the interior life behind the smiling face that Selena showed the world. What of the drive that led her to music? What comfort did she find in it? What pain?\n",
        "This is a simple story of hope and triumph, of one girl with the drive to succeed defying the odds and following her dream. It's not an original tale -- movies like this abound -- but Nava's point-of-view is fresh.\n",
        "Selena Quintanilla Perez's life was too short to fill a screen bio with traditional dramatic components, yet Selena infectiously salutes the Tejano singer who had a rapturous fan base when she was slain in 1995.\n",
        "Selena succeeds, through Lopez's performance, in evoking the magic of a sweet and talented young woman.\n",
        "Though Hour 2's heavy emphasis on physical and emotional confrontations stimulates dramatic momentum, this respectable superstar meeting is finally, of all things, ordinary.\n",
        "Cats Don't Dance, nor do they enchant.\n",
        "t's a celebration of bonds that are thicker than blood and demonstrates above all that fame-and-fortune fantasies can blur divisions of race and class as persuasively as they can exaggerate them.\n",
        "Formulaic and distastefully fake, Townsend's modern fairy tale unsuccessfuly tries to combine the premise of Pretty Woman with the formats of the fish-out-of-water and culture-collision.\n",
        "You can see how the black, modern-day Pygmalion-type story could work, just, but not with this heap of cabbage leaves for a script, and not with such desperately goofy acting from Berry and Desselle.\n",
        "Paying movie-goers deserve more, especially from someone who has previously shown signs of genuine comic aptitude.\n",
        "It's good for a half-hour of humor before the fun starts to dissolve.\n",
        "A very funny movie.\n",
        "Jaw-droppingly bad, a movie so misconceived I wonder why anyone involved wanted to make it.\n",
        "It's the kind of movie they don't make anymore -- and when they did, it was at the bottom of the bill after onscreen ads for local merchants.\n",
        "They both do good work, but it's Desselle who steals the film and grabs the major laughs.\n",
        "A high-spirited fantasy adventure.\n",
        "Like the TV series, the pic features makeup and special-effects gimmickry that are far less persuasive than what might be found at second-rate theme-park attractions.\n",
        "With minimalist and universal fantasies as their points of departure, the superheroic deeds evolve only incrementally beyond the realistic -- a deeply satisfying process.\n",
        "Five-year-olds who have read their Shakespeare will recognize that Turbo is a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.\n",
        "A purgatory of low-budget interplanetary adventure.\n",
        "Turbo is a solid follow-up to the entertaining 1995 Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n",
        "It's cheesy-looking and convoluted and has as much character as a bus tire.\n",
        "Rodman is more fun to watch here than either co-star, given his array of earrings and nose rings, plus hair that changes color more frequently than the first lady changes her do.\n",
        "Cast of newcomers is appealing, but this small-town melodrama is so old-fashioned and out-of-touch with contemporary youth that it feels as if it were made the same time that its story is set, in 1957.\n",
        "Would be a lot more fun were it a trashy Troy Donahue-Diane McBain vehicle ground out by Warner Bros. in 1960.\n",
        "Anaconda, directed by Luis Llosa with all of the subtlety of a snake-oil salesman, is in the great tradition of cinematic cheese, as processed as Kraft Singles slices.\n",
        "A silly and plodding Jaws rip-off about a 40-foot man-eating snake on the prowl in the Brazilian rain forest.\n",
        "One never questions the realism of the remarkable animatronic and computer-generated effects, but it's hard to credit a snake that screams.\n",
        "Anaconda is about a snake that eats everybody. That about says it all.\n",
        "Anaconda is such a classic combination of feckless dramaturgy and rampant excess that giving way to giggles is the only sane response.\n",
        "A trashily entertaining reptilian version of Jaws set in the steaming heart of the Amazon rain forest.\n",
        "It isn't art, but it'll crush your bones.\n",
        "It's a slick, scary, funny Creature Feature, beautifully photographed and splendidly acted in high adventure style.\n",
        "Anaconda is trying to be a Jaws for the '90s, but, like last year's The Ghost and the Darkness, it falls short in several key areas.\n",
        "Despite some early indications from the two Cusacks and Arkin that it's going to be funny, it winds up an unholy mess that becomes steadily more incoherent -- morally, dramatically, and conceptually.\n",
        "Cusack is charming and assured in the film.\n",
        "For what is essentially a one-joke movie, this has an awful lot going for it.\n",
        "A soggy, all-over-the- place mess.\n",
        "An entertaining oddity, an amiably black comedy whose bared teeth double as an engaging smile: It takes a satiric bite and leaves you laughing through the pain. For that, we can thank the writers.\n",
        "A bright burst of action and comedy with a cast that makes for rousing good company.\n",
        "Clever enough to make jokes about Greco-Roman wrestling and make them funny, Grosse Pointe Blank's greatest success is the way it maintains its comic attitude.\n",
        "What makes us laugh at this dark comedy is the insolence its creators hold for the very bones of their narrative.\n",
        "The film offers sufficient small pleasures to make it worth enduring the less effective elements. As a result, while Grosse Pointe Blank fails to deliver a fullisade, at least the chamber's not empty, either.\n",
        "The film takes the form but not the feel of a comic thriller. It's quirkier than that.\n",
        "Directed jauntily by George Armitage, it has the jokey, winsome tone of his earlier Miami Blues and enough wild-card energy to keep it bright and surprising.\n",
        "It's a sad day when an actor who's totally, beautifully in touch with his dark side finds himself stuck in a movie that's scared of its own shadow.\n",
        "With a breezy unpredictability that belies a darker underside, Grosse Pointe Blank, directed by George Armitage, is the kind of quirky, character-driven comedy they don't make much anymore.\n",
        "A large cast of gifted actress, including Glenn Close and Frances McDormand, is largely wasted in Beresford's honroable but failed effort to pay tribute to a group of disparate women held captive by the Japanese in WWII.\n",
        "Even with its grueling pageant of torture and abuse at the hands of monstrously inhuman Japanese officers, Road never reaches the heart.\n",
        "Dated and obvious.\n",
        "Kudrow's Michele is a deadpan delight.\n",
        "Beneath the endless silliness of the movie beats a real heart\n",
        "Isn't so much a movie as an overly long pilot episode of some new \"Must See TV'' sitcom.\n",
        "For all its bright moments, 91 minutes turns out to be more than this joke can sustain.\n",
        "A one-joke story that's better crafted than it really deserves to be.\n",
        "At its best when it's being lighthearted and at its weakest when it takes a halfhearted stab at semi-seriousness.\n",
        "Cheerful, giddy fun\n",
        "A delicious comedy about bitchiness, oneupwomanship and those emotional scars left from high school days.\n",
        "Staged more like a TV sitcom than a movie\n",
        "Writer Robin Schiff, expanding on minor characters in a play, fails to find enough for her ditsy and ditsier pair to do.\n",
        "A frothy comedy with the most adorable buddies since Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\n",
        "Sorvino and Kudrow work easily and wickedly together.\n",
        "Never generates a head of true excitement, partly because the characters remain constructs designed to perform defined functions, and partly due to the time-worn hokiness of the whole disaster-film format.\n",
        "Jones and Heche work hard to dig up an emotional rapport from next to nothing, while the slow but inexorable progress of the lava makes for more suspense than the usual slam bang firework display.\n",
        "A host of characters is introduced in the opening scenes, but Volcano doesn't know what to do with them. It can't make us care.\n",
        "The coast may be toast, but it's the lava, covering everything like a malevolent tide of melted butter, that makes this a disaster picture that's tastier than usual.\n",
        "Like the substantially better Twister, this film insists on a thunderous, exhausting pace that inevitably becomes deflating.\n",
        "A flatulent blast of superheated air from the seething bowels of Hollywood...\n",
        "Hundreds of screen technicians obviously slaved on the effects -- and for what? A dopey subplot about a bogus arrest. Soap opera involving Jones' injured daughter.\n",
        "Volcano is an absolutely standard, assembly-line undertaking; no wonder one of the extras is reading a paperback titled \"Screenwriting Made Easy.\"\n",
        "This is one of the best pure disaster movies ever made (not that it has much competition). Congratulations to director Mick Jackson for a job well done.\n",
        "We may not need as many Austin Powers movies as there are James Bond pictures, but one or two more might be nice.\n",
        "Jay Roach directed with just the right amount of period tackiness.\n",
        "The originals were spoofs in their own way, too, unless you really believe that secret agents look more like Sean Connery than Aldrich Ames.\n",
        "A loving paean to Bond, Flint, Helm and their ilk (as well as a myriad of outlandish villains), the film knows its turf and only missteps when it ventures into more contemporary territory.\n",
        "It would take a stone face not to crumple at Austin's dodgy catchphrases and irrepressible sexual desperation.\n",
        "Spy movie parodies are common, but Myers is observant enough to notice things that others haven't.\n",
        "Mike Myers may be a connoisseur of the old spy-and-sex genre, but the result is less a screenplay than a manic quote machine.\n",
        "Tasteless and humorless!\n",
        "A funny movie that only gets funnier.\n",
        "The movie fails to live up to its promise.\n",
        "[Myer's] affection for the era and its gaudy, bawdy movies inject this bit of fluff with giddy energy.\n",
        "The film's singlemindedness is so dauntless and just plain nutty that it's hard to resist.\n",
        "Even at its best, it's not very funny.\n",
        "Austin Powers is worth a look and will definitely boost Myers' career.\n",
        "A feminist comedy with real bite; it always brings down the house.\n",
        "In Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, Mr. Almodovar sets out to charm rather than shock. That he succeeds should not come as a surprise.\n",
        "This is painless sexual politics, a fiendish comedy full of prickles and pain and the bright shiny pinks of a matador's cape.\n",
        "Women slinks devilishly (and expertly) between farce, absurdism and tragedy.\n",
        "How Posey's neurotic, self-destructive heroine finds her way to healing is the core of this generous film, whose moral is that happiness can't begin unless you're open to its possibility.\n",
        "A likable but wan romance.\n",
        "Filmmaking is a family affair for the Cassavetes, and Zoe inherits the unpretentious, performance-driven style from her father, John, while delivering a love story that's accessible enough for mainstream audiences, a trick learned from her brother Nick.\n",
        "Cassavetes supplies no easy answers or easy laughs, forgoing romantic-comedy beats in respect for Nora's desperation. Call this confection a romantic-dramedy with humor on wry.\n",
        "Broken English establishes a sympathetic character, gets Parker Posey to make her real, and then grinds her in the gears of a plot we cannot believe.\n",
        "A promising first film with moments exceeding that promise.\n",
        "A welcome chance to see Posey at her flighty, edgy best. Is there an actress alive better able to convey the neuroses and self-doubts of the typical over-educated, under-challenged American woman?\n",
        "This is a very uneven effort, it lost me a couple of times, but then I got back into it due to the performances, the understated directing and the writing.\n",
        "Posey's comedic performances have always had a nervous vulnerability to them; here, she strips away just enough of the comedy to break our hearts.\n",
        "...there's a resolutely indie spirit at work here that keeps things interesting even when they shouldn't be.\n",
        "...there are reasons to catch Broken English, chief among them Posey's winning performance as a woman unsure whether to trust her romantic instincts.\n",
        "The fence-straddling would be fatal if it weren't for Posey, who takes what's essentially a character sketch and turns it into a three-dimensional mess in a dress.\n",
        "Although it's conventionally filmed and rather flat looking, the first dramatic feature written and directed by Zoe Cassavetes displays a good deal of her father John's appreciation for unembellished honesty.\n",
        "As a director, Cassavetes is a keen observer of character and social interaction.\n",
        "Broken English doesn't break any code or offer original insights on the subject. But there's a spark whenever Posey and Poupaud are together, and Paris and Manhattan glisten in the background.\n",
        "Broken English is a conventional New York-lonely hearts story made watchable by one element and one element only: Parker Posey.\n",
        "The low-key comedy Broken English is a textbook example of an Indiewood film: a Hollywood fantasy wrapped in plain brown paper.\n",
        "Posey is a delight throughout, and Zoe Cassavetes is clearly a filmmaker to watch.\n",
        "The director doesn't have the confidence to veer too far from the norm. Her touchingly quirky screenplay eventually turns into a disappointingly conventional fairy tale.\n",
        "With a running time of nearly four hours, Cecil B. De Mille's last feature and most extravagant blockbuster is full of the absurdities and vulgarities one expects, but it isn't boring for a minute.\n",
        "DeMille remains conventional with the motion picture as an art form. The eyes of the onlooker are filled with spectacle. Emotional tug is sometimes lacking.\n",
        "It's the gigantic vulgarity, the obsessive righteousness of the director himself, which keeps the show on the road and suffuses the movie with its daft power.\n",
        "The crammed contents are linked ponderously in a long, warning movie sermon that has authority but little power.\n",
        "Warriors of Virtue is a great title. Unfortunately, it's not a great movie.\n",
        "No masterpiece but undeniably heavy on laughs, the movie is put over by the buffed, lubricated dynamics of two leads who substantially transcend what is otherwise a borderline tepid dose of family values.\n",
        "A hodgepodge of elements that don't comfortably coalesce.\n",
        "Besson's futuristic fable is flawed by a messy narrative which strains to incorporate far too many grotesque and eccentric characters.\n",
        "The Fifth Element has to be the most creative visualization since Tim Burton's first Batman in 1989. On top of that, it's a whole lot of fun.\n",
        "There's no doubt about it, when it comes to saving the world, Bruce Willis is your man. He does it with smarts and style, humor and courage.\n",
        "Mr. Besson directs with ceaseless flamboyance and with an obvious enthusiasm for his film's comic book conceits. But the tone of The Fifth Element is often terribly shrill, especially when attention shifts to grating minor characters.\n",
        "One of the great goofy movies -- a film so preposterous I wasn't surprised to discover it was written by a teenage boy.\n",
        "An overblown cosmic comic book.\n",
        "As you sit through the interminable two-hours-plus that constitute The Fifth Element -- a colossally stupid, overbearingly pompous new movie by Luc Besson -- you can expect to become acquainted with boredom on the most elemental level.\n",
        "A lot of money was spent on this film, but $100 million doesn't guarantee a good product. Maybe someone should have thought of spending a few more dollars on a better script.\n",
        "Everything in the film rings true, is deeply moving, richly photographed, and wonderfully acted.\n",
        "The acting is excellent.\n",
        "The film has the glorious sweep of an epic.\n",
        "Link creates a complex and fascinating portrait of a marriage under the enormous stress of geographical dislocation and historical trauma.\n",
        "One very fine film.\n",
        "The pacing of Nowhere in Africa is a mite drowsy, but there are payoffs for the director's uninsistent touch.\n",
        "A worthy, complex and nuanced film.\n",
        "Nowhere in Africa is a movie of many moods and nuances. In addition to being a Holocaust saga, it's a girl's story, a woman's story and the story of a marriage.\n",
        "Superbly acted and brilliantly lensed, Nowhere In Africa is that hard-to-achieve movie where the small picture counts for more than the bigger one.\n",
        "A well-acted, exquisitely photographed, plot-jammed movie that sinks into melodrama and reveals too little about the African culture and landscape in which it's set.\n",
        "An instant family classic to be shared and enjoyed by parents and mature teens.\n",
        "If there's a love story here, it's the Redlichs' -- and the director's -- love for the stark beauty of Africa.\n",
        "There's a lot more to Nowhere in Africa -- too much, actually ... Yet even if the movie has at least one act too many, the question that runs through it -- of whether belonging to a place is a matter of time or of will -- remains consistent.\n",
        "What rescues the film is ... the quality of the acting.\n",
        "Nowhere in Africa isn't really a dull film so much as an oddly quaint one that seems to find a comfortable perspective about drastic circumstances.\n",
        "This consistently absorbing family saga is primarily a safari of the soul.\n",
        "The film is entirely within the caught-on-the-run tradition of cinema verite, which makes it all the grittier and its conclusion all the more wrenching.\n",
        "The conflicts involved are intense and absorbing, proving that compelling moral dilemmas make for the most dramatic cinema.\n",
        "The Dardenne brothers, as shown by their empathic casting, their very choice of theme, have confessed to a burden. They believe in hope.\n",
        "Ranks with the great European art-house classics about childhood betrayed and innocence lost.\n",
        "Speaks volumes about how we treat other human beings and what it means to truly grow up.\n",
        "Almost everyone should be able to identify with the wrenching moral quandary facing Igor.\n",
        "Terrence McNally's Tony award-winning play, a perceptive, often hilarious look and love and life in the AIDS era, is so sharply written and bluntly entertaining that it almost overcomes Joe Mantell's static direction, which is too theatrical.\n",
        "Outdoor settings alone do not a movie make, though director Joe Mantello (who also directed the play) seems to be trying.\n",
        "This leisurely little import has its moments - but far too many of them. It runs two hours and seems to end five times.\n",
        "Shall We Dance?' holds forth the sunny possibility that beyond the most timid exterior there may be a tangoing Walter Mitty to be found.\n",
        "This twisted romance possesses the soul and edgy atmosphere of an independent film but not quite the conviction.\n",
        "Writer/director Herman pulls off a popular, proletarian comedy which might actually appeal to the people it's about.\n",
        "\"Brassed Off'' is a sweet film with a lot of anger at its core.\n",
        "The characters are beautifully drawn in this bittersweet melodrama written and directed by Mark Herman.\n",
        "A shining ensemble cast that hits all the right notes makes Brassed Off toot sweet.\n",
        "Shamelessly manipulative and sentimental, but in an agreeably familiar way.\n",
        "The cast is ardent as all get-out, but the most authentic emotional lift comes from the real-life Grimethorpe Colliery Brass Band, blowing their hearts out.\n",
        "The dinosaur creations are even better than those in the first film --- credible, breathtaking and frightening. As for the rest, every department pales by comparison.\n",
        "In short, what you'd expect, and no more.\n",
        "The Lost World has the vibe of 'obligatory sequel,' just what director Steven Spielberg probably wanted to avoid.\n",
        "Special effects demand dino closeups, but the technical miracles seem sadly mundane.\n",
        "Many people will find much to divert them in The Lost World, and not worry whether or not it falls short of Jurassic Park.\n",
        "Offers less screen rapture for your raptor than its predecessor did, unless your sole priority is dino-mighty effects.\n",
        "Repetitiveness notwithstanding, The Lost World boasts several edge-of-the-seat moments.\n",
        "Militaristic bounty hunters...intend to capture these animals, ship them to San Diego and make a profitable spectacle out of them.\n",
        "Where is the awe? Where is the sense that if dinosaurs really walked the earth, a film about them would be more than a monster movie? Where are the ooohs and ahhhs?\n",
        "There are many more dinosaurs this time around, taking up much more screen time...But don't expect to be wowed as much as you were by Jurassic Park.\n",
        "The Lost World, while terrifically entertaining, is also structurally out of kilter.\n",
        "Spielberg's dinos, manipulated by a small army of puppeteers, are watchable enough. But these artificial critters have little reason to be resurrected in our era, let alone on 3,300 screens over Memorial Day weekend.\n",
        "Exasperating as it is, Schizopolis has a deliberateness almost interesting enough to offset its sophomoric streak.\n",
        "Schizopolis represents a minor act of self-indulgence on the part of the sometimes eccentric Steven Soderbergh but results in major tedium for the viewer.\n",
        "It's fresh, unexpected and goofy. It's not a smart career move, just a film that its director wanted to make for some crazy reason, and he made it.\n",
        "... I felt as if I were being preached to throughout this film.\n",
        "Boring as porridge.\n",
        "An OK kids movie passing through on the way to video.\n",
        "You won't find the pragmatic intelligence of Naylor's original stories here, but even cynics may be touched by the film's remarkably wholesome lessons about friendship, family and forgiveness.\n",
        "It's a family film that deals with real problems and teaches real values, and yet is exciting and entertaining.\n",
        "Plain and simple but never simple-minded.\n",
        "Saving Shiloh is touching, intelligent and admirably thoughtful.\n",
        "Two major issues here: The boy, Marty (Jason Dolley), is a patronizing do-gooder, and the dog, a beagle-looking fella, doesn't do much that's special.\n",
        "Saving Shiloh, the third in the dog-hero trilogy drawn from the Phyllis Reynolds Naylor books, may be naive and narratively simple, but it's prime fare for the always underserved family aud.\n",
        "The latest film to be drawn from Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's best-selling young-adult trilogy about a frisky West Virginia beagle with a knack for bringing people together.\n",
        "Rough going.\n",
        "There are chuckles to be had, but get your own continuance by waiting for the video.\n",
        "Stifled by quaint Masterpiece Theatre-for-tykes pretensions, Buddy only comes alive when its quartet of real-life chimps go ape.\n",
        "Rosenberg's sarcastic, tough-guy dialogue is full of lean-and-mean one-liners, and the superbly cast actors know how to milk them for all they're worth.\n",
        "Very cool, but also very cold.\n",
        "They're 'the worst of the worst.' So's the movie.\n",
        "Numbing but not boring, it's finally more dispiriting than exhilarating, like a wild night of debauchery that leaves only a fearsome hangover for a souvenir.\n",
        "I kept thinking that if their budget were cut in half, they would have made a better picture. If the special effects department were put on a much stricter budget, the show might have had to develop the characters beyond caricature.\n",
        "Sitting through this movie is like watching a dog running in circles chasing its tail -- the amusement factor dies quickly as the situation become repetitive.\n",
        "The movie is essentially a series of quick setups, brisk dialogue and elaborate action sequences.\n",
        "Massaging every demographic, this admittedly fast, funny and robustly acted progeny of The Rock exploits actions of killers and rapists -- then cynically sells family values with a lengthy wrap-up ballad.\n",
        "All of the principals normally work in films more interesting and human than this one, which gives Con Air a touch of the subversive and turns it into a big-budget lark.\n",
        "How's the movie? Big, loud, brutal and stupid, that's how it is.\n",
        "At first daunting but ultimately awesomely impressive and beautiful.\n",
        "A very intimate, sensual film, and a torrid, lurid melodrama, full of passion, jealousy, hatred and revenge.\n",
        "A seductive and elegant story that combines a millennium of Japanese art and fetishes with the story of a neurotic modern woman who tells a lover: \"Treat me like the pages of a book.\"\n",
        "Greenaway, whose mind is one of the most impressive, complicated organs that ever sat on the shoulders of a filmmaker, seems to be playing connect the dots to himself, almost dumbing himself down to be commercial.\n",
        "Despite its arresting visual style, its wave after wave of creative and hypnotic images, \"The Pillow Book,\" as its name hints, slowly but inexorably leads to sleep.\n",
        "''The Pillow Book'' finds the filmmaker at his most atypically seductive, creating a spellbinding web of cruel elegance and intricate gamesmanship, exploring the exotic, haunting beauty of the bizarre.\n",
        "Such Greenaway films as \"The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover,\" \"Prospero's Books\" and now this make one wonder if they're really as deep as they pretend to be. Perhaps, as his actors, this emperor has no clothes.\n",
        "I can't say that I've ever entertained fantasies of writing on someone's body. But Peter Greenaway's The Pillow Book does, at least, succeed in making it look like an erotic activity.\n",
        "Speed 2 is frantic action, tinny dialogue, perfunctory characterization and tried-and-false plot pilferings.\n",
        "De Bont remains an expert director of action, but putting the reference to cruise control in the title serves as fair warning of an unengaged filmmaker on automatic pilot.\n",
        "[A] truly horrid sequel.\n",
        "The human propensity to tamper with a good thing is probably ineluctable.\n",
        "In Speed 2, De Bont is, so to speak, at sea.\n",
        "Speed 2 is the most exciting to date of this summer's big action pictures.\n",
        "It's a complete lack of story that explains why this expensive production from the proficient creator of Speed and Twister sputters out on the high seas.\n",
        "Do yourself a favor and see a movie instead.\n",
        "[It] sinks faster than a rock.\n",
        "Speed 2 suffers from a slender script, a tedious first reel and a routine villain who lacks the entertaining menace that Speed's diabolical madman projected.\n",
        "Dafoe's take on Dennis Hopper's Hopper impersonation is plain pointless; Bullock too is wasted in a ditzy half-role; and Patric is unsmiling and resolutely uncharismatic.\n",
        "Speed 2 doesn't have much in mind besides convincing an audience that a runaway ocean liner is a dynamic menace. Fine, but it doesn't beat a runaway bus.\n",
        "Even the film's big-ticket closing stunts are more impressive for their size than for any excitement they generate.\n",
        "They keep getting worse and worse and worse . . .\n",
        "Movies like this embrace goofiness with an almost sensual pleasure. And so, on a warm summer evening, do I.\n",
        "I hope that somewhere Keanu Reeves is laughing about being considered a nonactor while the wax dummy Jason Patric has somehow achieved a rep as intense and gifted.\n",
        "A waterlogged sequel that'll soon be bottom-feeding with Beyond the Poseidon Adventure.\n",
        "Speed 2 can be numbered among the worst second chapters ever made.\n",
        "By now, the dispatching of various comic-book meanies is the least satisfying part of the deal, no matter how many disco scenes or gizmos are thrown onto the screen.\n",
        "Loud, uninspired, and interminable.\n",
        "The villains, Arnold Schwarzenegger and especially Uma Thurman in this instance, remain the highlights here, as the rest of the gargantuan production lacks the dash and excitement that would have given the franchise a boost in its eighth year.\n",
        "The fourth Bat-flick finds this juvenile franchise running on empty.\n",
        "Campy costumes can't disguise the incoherent plot, confused performances and lame script that send this star vehicle spiralling downward.\n",
        "[Schumacher's] storytelling is limp, and the characters lack energy.\n",
        "George Clooney is the big zero of the film, and should go down in history as the George Lazenby of the series.\n",
        "If you like 'em busy, this sequel is for you.\n",
        "Some nifty celestial surfing and a good finale compensate for a dead midsection.\n",
        "Apart from its eye-appeal, though, Batman & Robin is a virtually joyless exercise, a lumbering saga of a city under assault on two fronts.\n",
        "Like stumbling into the world's longest coming attractions trailer, or a product reel for a special-effects house.\n",
        "Please, supervillains, you mutter quietly. Deliver us from the bland.\n",
        "Wonderful to look at, and has nothing authentic at its core.\n",
        "Holy creative breakdown, Batman!\n",
        "Pointless, plodding plotting; asinine action; clueless, comatose characterization; and dumb dialogue.\n",
        "As played by Uma Thurman, Poison Ivy is perfect, flaunting great looks, a mocking attitude and madly flamboyant disguises.\n",
        "Despite the emphasis on Oedipal conflict, the film expresses no desire to enter the grownup world; happiness here is associated with eternal adolescence, following the '70s (and now, apparently, '90s) ideal.\n",
        "A throwback to the independent-minded, anything-goes movies that followed in the wake of Easy Rider in the early 1970s.\n",
        "Clearly, it wishes to be different, but anyone who fondly recalls the buddy films of the '70s will find it to be more of the same.\n",
        "As the film progresses, however, it begins to accumulate all sorts of unnecessary characters and subplots that only serve to weigh it down.\n",
        "A harangue on how ironic it is that men often attack one another verbally and physically as a way to get close.\n",
        "[A] refreshing, unexpectedly profound comedy.\n",
        "It's finely shot though and moves along crisply to the beat of its atmospheric modern blues and indie soundtrack.\n",
        "The filmmaker does keep one nifty -- we might even say quirky -- little surprise for the end.\n",
        "The performances here are superb.\n",
        "How Dream With the Fishes works is that the road movie and buddy movie formulas slowly dissolve from around Nick and Terry, who by the end of the movie stand revealed in three dimensions.\n",
        "Dream With the Fishes is a film in its own category. It's not a drama or a comedy. It's neither realistic nor surreal. It's a piece of poetry that, at times, is harsh and ugly. The film is both dark and light but somehow always true to itself.\n",
        "Dream with the Fishes is not a great film. Nevertheless, it is a good film, and it's hard to deny the simple power of the climax.\n",
        "Mr. Finn has a fine, succinct way with such acerbic touches, and he gives Dream With the Fishes a lean and distinctive visual style.\n",
        "We don't feel much of anything.\n",
        "The draggy narrative of this 1997 comedy is tough to sit through -- there are even several overproduced musical numbers -- but it does have an intriguing subversive element that I don't want to give away.\n",
        "Anchored by skilled comedienne Julia Roberts, this skewered variation on jealousy and the wrong woman doing battle in the aisles is a winning balance of the familiar and the novel.\n",
        "The film's brazen amorality gradually freezes the smile on your face.\n",
        "A misbegotten attempt to update the genre that only proves the enduring -- if not downright inviolable -- appeal of the boy-meets-girl scenario.\n",
        "[Julia Roberts] is at her vibrant best.\n",
        "Every once in a long while, along comes a refreshing change like My Best Friend's Wedding, a movie whose appeal rests largely on its knack for defying our expectations by riffing off, even undermining, a familiar genre.\n",
        "Roberts puts her heart into this one. Audiences are likely to return the favor.\n",
        "My Best Friend's Wedding feels repetitive at times, but its star power and willingness to undercut convention come through at the end.\n",
        "A romantic comedy conspicuously lacking either romance or comedy.\n",
        "Emotionally, this is a movie that just doesn't compute. You leave feeling cross, as if you've been tricked.\n",
        "[An] obtuse, prettily decorative comedy.\n",
        "In the eleventh hour, a little romance creeps into this distinctly unromantic comedy.\n",
        "My Best Friend's Wedding has a bit of an edge and enough intelligence to keep it from drowning in the kind of mawkish sentimentality that often makes this sort of movie hard-to-swallow.\n",
        "After too long dulling down in duds like Mary Reilly, [Roberts] dazzles again.\n",
        "The screenplay has never been on autopilot; it just fooled us into thinking it was, in order to sneak up on the unpredictability.\n",
        "A farce-comedy, it must thrive, if it's to do so, on sparkle. But the bubbles are sparse, partly because of Roberts's low fizz level.\n",
        "Possibly Godard's most melancholy film and probably his most beautiful ...\n",
        "What's the price of selling out? Contempt asks the question of its characters, its audience, and its own director.\n",
        "Godard has finally dared to get serious, achieving not mock pathos but a perfect tragedy.\n",
        "Godard sets interesting scenes, with provocative color combinations and a suggestive pictorial flow. But out of it all comes nothing -- or very little that tells you why this wife is so contemptuous of her husband. Maybe he should be contemptuous of her!\n",
        "Inevitably a melancholy film, but a memorable one as well.\n",
        "I would argue that Godard's eclecticism must be acknowledged and understood before one can genuinely appreciate the film.\n",
        "It emerges as one of Godard's most emotional films.\n",
        "This one has too much forced intellectualism to it, even though it is an engrossing time capsule.\n",
        "It takes its artistic agenda seriously, but also luxuriates in the sensuality and plasticity of film images.\n",
        "Contempt was Jean-Luc Godard's 1963 attempt at a big-budget, big- star production, and more or less satisfied his curiosity.\n",
        "...a movie that not only expected me to pay attention, it assumed that I could.\n",
        "The girl and the hospital patients and staff also turn up in his improvised adventure, extravagantly garbed by costume designer Eiko Ishioka.\n",
        "The pacing drags and the cliched tussle between childhood innocence and adult disillusionment can only go one way. Better to experience it than think about it, fair to say.\n",
        "Pace and Untaru generate an unforced chemistry that makes them pleasant company for a couple of hours, but they almost work against the movie's need to establish narrative tension. They appear to be having such a good time that Roy's self-destructive impu\n",
        "An achingly beautiful movie and a triumph of location scouting, with more cosmopolitan spectacle than the past three Indiana Jones and James Bond movies combined.\n",
        "Sometimes, looking good isn't enough.\n",
        "That's the trouble with candy, the eye kind or the tooth-decaying variety. It's only after you've made a glutton of yourself that you realize you haven't devoured anything particularly filling.\n",
        "The Fall is a technically dazzling film that instantly gratifies the eye, but falls short of appeasing the head or the heart with its visual excesses.\n",
        "This is a stunning coffee-table book, but it's not really a movie.\n",
        "A bewitching movie, rich in ideas and humanity, and it reminds us that fiction is real to the one who imagines it. Adults might read with detachment, but kids know the truth: It matters who lives and who dies in a story. It matters for them, and for us.\n",
        "The Fall may indeed stumble at times, and it's certainly hard to categorize. But it's also exhilarating in reach and vision while admirable in execution. If only more films aspired to such wonder.\n",
        "Tarsem's The Fall is a mad folly, an extravagant visual orgy, a free-fall from reality into uncharted realms. Surely it is one of the wildest indulgences a director has ever granted himself.\n",
        "Dazzling and delirious, The Fall is a celebration of cinema, of old-fashioned storytelling and globe-hopping spectacle.\n",
        "Some filmmakers can imagine everything and select nothing, and while it's clear as a bell Tarsem has more talent than almost any 10 directors put together, in The Fall he's basically showing off with every new wondrous image.\n",
        "It really adds up to a whole lot of nothing.\n",
        "The Fall is aptly named not only because it pertains to a tragic descent but because viewers will feel as if they have plunged headlong into an alternate universe with this dazzling adult fairy tale.\n",
        "A work of shimmering beauty.\n",
        "Visually enchanting.\n",
        "There is hardly a composition in the film that couldn't be extracted and framed.\n",
        "Movies such as this work like meditation or music, to nudge us toward the important.\n",
        "Like its subject, Gabbeh is woven with art.\n",
        "Its attitude is poised somewhere between the deadpan ghoulishness of the Coen brothers and a Letterman-like sense of the absurdity of life in New York's rich ethnic stew.\n",
        "Men in Black is moderately amusing, well-constructed and mercifully short, but it fails to deliver on the zaniness of its first half.\n",
        "This spaced-out comedy may not be bliss, but it sure is fun.\n",
        "A smart, funny and hip adventure film in a summer of car wrecks and explosions.\n",
        "Every time the film makes you chuckle, you may also feel it's zapped you with a neuralizer.\n",
        "A wild knuckleball of a movie that keeps dancing in and out of the strike zone.\n",
        "The smartest, funniest, and best-looking sci-fi comedy since the movies learned to morph.\n",
        "It's just the best yuk of the week.\n",
        "It's so much fun, in fact, that it's almost over before you realise that you've been watching a great idea for a movie in desperate search of a plot.\n",
        "As ragged as the humor is, there still are more hits than misses.\n",
        "At times, it may succeed at manipulating you, but you won't like it.\n",
        "The result is a rich picture with a winning personality, as modest in theme as it is in style.\n",
        "To quote the film's wisest alien, who just happens to be occupying the body of an ugly-ass pug dog, 'You don't like it, you can kiss my furry little butt.'\n",
        "Though its charm is in its attitude and premise (and Danny Elfman's rousing score), Men in Black does have a serviceable plot that kicks in when a rusty flying saucer crash-lands in a rural area.\n",
        "...thanks to Solomon's sparkling dialogue, Sonnenfeld's graceful economy, and a steady visual inventiveness, Men in Black takes the radical step of assuming that its audience is hip and smart, and it shines with that generous act of complicity.\n",
        "It's smart, it looks sensational and it's funny -- sneaky-funny.\n",
        "Men in Black continues this summer's tradition, already established by Con Air and Batman and Robin, of big-budget action pictures that at least have the wit to know how silly they are.\n",
        "Those accepting Men in Black for what it is will likely agree that this is one of 1997's more satisfying big-budget offerings.\n",
        "The film's technical team reflects exceptional stylistic harmony.\n",
        "Sporadically engaging.\n",
        "Wild America often feels like a MMMBop-ish Hanson brothers music video redone for the Discovery Channel.\n",
        "Something like one of those mysterious asteroids that get the astronomers all worked up: a large body of gaseous matter surrounding a relatively small core of solid substance.\n",
        "When it's good, it's very good. And when it's not, it can be as silly and self-important as a bad '50s sci-fi movie.\n",
        "Like Jodie Foster's hopeful space voyager in the picture, \"Contact\" may not travel quite as far as it hopes to go, but the trip is worth taking nonetheless.\n",
        "Begins with a big bang, gradually falls into a lull and finally succumbs to entropy.\n",
        "Contact takes forever to lift off.\n",
        "Features heavy-handed exposition, repetitive, maudlin flashbacks, uneven performances and endless sermonising.\n",
        "When it tries to personify the struggle between skepticism and faith in the relationship between Ellie and her theologian boyfriend, it becomes flat and obvious.\n",
        "Contact, which aims for awe, ends up with piffle.\n",
        "An exhilarating adventure.\n",
        "While the movie doesn't qualify as an awful waste of space by any means, it has so many creative black holes, you'll have to weigh the entertainment odds before making this journey.\n",
        "Contact is at its most relaxed when it sheds its intellectual pretensions and reveals its media-wise sense of humor.\n",
        "Zemeckis uses special effects to suggest the climactic events without upstaging them.\n",
        "The movie's CNN strategy, whereby credibility is measured in TV exposure, proves fatal, often throwing the proceedings into a laughable tailspin.\n",
        "For an aspiring ultimate trip, Contact has a flimsy dramatic grip.\n",
        "Faithful to Sagan's brand of popularized science, the film never reaches beyond Hollywood spectacle and sentimentality.\n",
        "This is the kind of motion picture that restores one's faith in what can be produced when a large budget is used wisely.\n",
        "It ends up being an unfulfilling exercise in pseudo-feminism.\n",
        "Not since Bambi's mother was killed has there been a cannier movie for kids than Conan the Barbarian.\n",
        "Conan the Barbarian is an extremely long, frequently incoherent, ineptly staged adventure-fantasy set in a prehistoric past.\n",
        "Even 17 years after its release, Conan the Barbarian still weaves a spell capable of ensorcelling fans of fantasy adventure.\n",
        "Surprisingly pleasant.\n",
        "Not quite inspired lunacy, the film has a game, likable quality and strong sequel potential.\n",
        "The story is incidental -- the villain wants to abduct the talking ape for financial gain -- and thankfully the animatronics and computer effects aren't allowed to overwhelm the proceedings.\n",
        "A pleasant surprise, one of the most witty, entertaining family films to come out in some time.\n",
        "George George, George of the Jungle. Boom boom BOOM BOOM . . . Oh, please shut up.\n",
        "There is not a banana's worth of plot in the Dana Olsen and Audrey Wells script to offer narrative nourishment.\n",
        "George of the Jungle may be unsophisticated, but it is enjoyable.\n",
        "The comedy in George of the Jungle is not sophisticated, but it is frequently audacious and irreverent.\n",
        "Part screwball romance, part special-effects adventure.\n",
        "An amiable, highly ingratiating piece of lowbrow entertainment, and the audience of mainly young children and parents I saw it with on Saturday night clearly had a ball. So did I.\n",
        "What really makes this work is Fraser, who plays it to the hilt.\n",
        "A few hip smarts get displayed here and there in this de facto, broadly comic Tarzan picture, which only reinforces the flailing feel that pervades a 92-minute running time.\n",
        "The movie would meander along, not going anywhere, and then -- pow! -- there'd be an enormous laugh. More meandering, and then pow! again.\n",
        "Mangold certainly knew what he was doing when he cast Keitel and De Niro.\n",
        "Cop Land shares its leading man's slow-wittedness, but also his likability.\n",
        "Mangold is something of a pseudo-Scorsese.\n",
        "It's pretty funny, actually, that Stallone gained 40 pounds to play this role, and what the movie needs more than anything else is to eat a salad and do some sit-ups.\n",
        "Although too simplistic in its good-guys/bad-guys approach to morally and emotionally ambiguous material, Cop Land emerges as an absorbing and dramatic yarn about exposing the evil doings of some of New York's finest.\n",
        "A solidly entertaining drama that stays true to the independent spirit of its filmmakers\n",
        "At its heart, the movie has a good story to tell: the lumbering oaf who's not nearly as stupid and not nearly as gutless as all the hot dogs from the big city think.\n",
        "The movie's no roller-coaster ride, but there isn't a boring moment either.\n",
        "The mystery suspense elements, however, grind from implausibility (the set-up), to cliche (the climax), with too much back story in between.\n",
        "This is a good filmthat could have been great if not for an act of well-intentioned, but misguided casting.\n",
        "Nearly down for the count in the movie ring, Stallone isn't just back in the fight. He's a winner.\n",
        "Though at first Cop Land seems as if it will be an ensemble piece, it is, in fact, Stallone's movie.\n",
        "A compelling, if imperfect, motion picture.\n",
        "The film is probably best taken as an ultimately slight but still compelling Eastern that plays like a vintage Western about personal redemption.\n",
        "A movie with such a promising concept, so poorly executed, that it begs to be remade.\n",
        "Whatever its limitations, Cop Land has talent to burn.\n",
        "Oh, the tyranny of being serious about your art: It's a shame when an actor like Sylvester Stallone, who's always at his most appealing when he just hunkers down and lets himself be a big galoot, feels he has to make a bid for respectability.\n",
        "Written and directed by James Mangold, the drama is dense but misses the moral complexities and grit, not to mention the oomph, of its urban predecessors.\n",
        "The film gives you the pleasurably junky sensation of living inside an apocalyptic videogame.\n",
        "A moodily malevolent, anything-goes revenge fantasy that relies more upon special visual and digitally animated effects for its intended appeal than any comics-derived sci-fier to date.\n",
        "This hopelessly redundant action gross-out aspires to a form of hip vacuousness -- and may achieve it.\n",
        "Dippe, an old SFX hand, needs to think about how to tell a story.\n",
        "The nonsensical screenplay can barely stand-up to the hellzapoppin,' Beelzebubbin' effects mustered by first-time director Mark Dippe.\n",
        "As a visual experience, Spawn is unforgettable.\n",
        "... an incoherent blitz of noise, chintzy special effects and bargain-basement allegory.\n",
        "There's no suspense, no emotional involvement with the characters, and the cynical, sophomoric storytelling is confusing.\n",
        "... a nonstop bombardment that recalls Judge Dredd, but with better diction.\n",
        "As a comic book, Spawn may be first rate, but, as a movie, it's a retread.\n",
        "Dull but harmless.\n",
        "[Aniston] has the rare gift of getting you to root for her in the most trying of circumstances, a quality that will stand her in good stead when she progresses to better material.\n",
        "[Aniston] at her best can recall young Barbra Streisand in her What's Up, Doc? days.\n",
        "Aniston doesn't need dialogue to catch Kate's quicksilver moods. It's the sitcom lines, at the service of a contrived plot, that choke her.\n",
        "Insubstantial and oversweet, it still refreshes as a midsummer brain cooler.\n",
        "Aniston comes across like an imitation of a movie star instead of the real thing. She gets less attractive as the film goes on.\n",
        "It's a shame the plot is so contrived, because parts of this movie are really pretty good.\n",
        "What Picture Perfect sells as romance is a junior high school health class morality lecture we all got years ago. And it was a crock then, too.\n",
        "There are times when a bad ending doesn't seriously damage a motion picture. This is not one of those.\n",
        "A dazzling, repellent exercise in which the case against men is closed before it's opened.\n",
        "LaBute, a playwright and former drama teacher, has succeeded in creating a study of banal, everyday evil.\n",
        "A dark, probing, truly disturbing exploration of yuppie angst and male anxieties as they manifest themselves in both the work and personal arenas.\n",
        "Cruel, cool and pleasingly provocative.\n",
        "Prepare for the conversation to grow heated.\n",
        "In the Company of Men is a singularly unpleasant movie. And from the point that Chad and Howard settle on Christine, it's an increasingly unbelievable one, too.\n",
        "The kind of bold, uncompromising film that insists on being thought about afterward -- talked about, argued about, hated if necessary, but not ignored.\n",
        "LaBute directs this low-budget film with such spareness and precision, using such minimal yet effective backdrops, that in retrospect his color film almost seems to have been in black and white. Its ideas are that stark.\n",
        "A provocative dissection of human dynamics, Men might just become the gotta-see-it August choice of adventurous filmgoers.\n",
        "One of those rarest of rare breeds -- a movie that doesn't just ignore Hollywood conventions, but openly flouts them.\n",
        "The strength of LaBute's conception every step of the way is in forcing the issue of where we belong in this picture -- with Chad, with Howard, or with Christine.\n",
        "This is a fully realized movie, whose intelligence -- despite its grim findings -- dwarfs any Hollywood production. It's a film to admire -- even if it leaves you cold.\n",
        "The three leads inhabit their roles in the way only unknown actors can. They really seem to become the characters they're playing.\n",
        "Donner directs with an efficient hand. He keeps the action moving briskly. But most important for this format, he knows how to slip in a quick joke or two without detracting from the tension of the suspenseful plot.\n",
        "The film starts to sour after 20 minutes...\n",
        "...more long-winded than cunningly elaborate, more simplistic than elegantly simple, and more nonsensical than anything else.\n",
        "...the strong impact that Gibson makes as damaged goods is diluted by selling Jerry as cute and redeemable.\n",
        "In the hands of stars in denial about their stardom and a director who can't be bothered to take things seriously, it has come out implausible and unsatisfying, a comic thriller that is not especially funny or thrilling.\n",
        "Donner is slick and shallow, but somewhat off his game here.\n",
        "...confused and disjointed...\n",
        "Unfortunately, the parts of the movie that are truly good are buried beneath the deadening layers of thriller cliches and an unconvincing love story.\n",
        "What makes Conspiracy Theory interesting beyond its cleverness and currency is how the filmmakers manipulate our feelings about its protagonist, Jerry, a New York City cab driver.\n",
        "En route to this cynical fade-out, Conspiracy Theory does show off enough glossy style ... and incidental cleverness to keep viewers largely hooked.\n",
        "The plot is every bit as zany and far more elaborate than that of Face/Off, but here again, you just go along with the silliness to savor the performances.\n",
        "...listening to Gibson's Jerry try to communicate what he's been through isn't suspenseful; it's exhausting.\n",
        "Based on Cassavetes pere script, this Cassavetes fils meditation on love and madness is a truly curioisity item, lacking the master's profound ideas and rich subtext; 20 years ago, it would have starred Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazzara and Peter Falk.\n",
        "The Sting-like ending with its crosses and double-crosses could have been better handled, but there are plenty of other payoffs.\n",
        "[The] dead-on imitations of some of the characters from the television series created by Bob Mosher and Joe Connelly will seem pointlessly stylized to viewers unfamiliar with the old sitcom.\n",
        "Fuzzily conceived and blandly executed.\n",
        "The Cleavers have come to represent the stereotype of the white-bread family.This reverent '90s remake doesn't do much to challenge it.\n",
        "The result is depressingly halfhearted.\n",
        "Credit the makers of Leave It to Beaver for their kindliness.\n",
        "The film is disarmingly charming.\n",
        "Why? That's the question foremost in my mind when I consider this latest motion picture retread of a defunct television series. Why was this movie made in the first place?\n",
        "Leave It to Beaver just stumbles about in a bland, irony-deprived suburbia that denies the movie any juice or bite and renders the Cleaver family even duller than it was.\n",
        "Leave It to Beaver is the sort of movie that could be described as good clean fun if it happened to be good or fun.\n",
        "A dark, dank and derivative horror ride only an Orkin man could truly love.\n",
        "Most of the time it's a kick.\n",
        "...it flies on and on until its power to hold us simply peters out.\n",
        "It's a great ride.\n",
        "Moments of silliness are more than balanced by Petersen's extraordinary ability to keep this movie flight-worthy, Ford's almost-executive presence and an outstanding performance from Oldman.\n",
        "Air Force One doesn't insult the audience. It is crafted by a film-maker who takes pride in the thrills and sly fun he packs into every frame.\n",
        "A piece of expertly crafted entertainment that gets the job done with skill and panache\n",
        "Seeing the president of the United States as a kick-butt action hero pretty much sums up the appeal of Air Force One\n",
        "Up to this moment, every detail ... has been exact ... But, because of that initial realism, audiences accept the fakery of what follows ... a president who, in physical prowess and stamina, makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look limp.\n",
        "Petersen, known for the efficient and vigorously muscular action of Das Boot and In the Line of Fire, once again directs with galvanizing intensity, but the relentlessness of these thrills carries little in the way of surprise.\n",
        "Harrison Ford is one of the most likable and convincing of movie stars, and he almost pulls off the impossible in Air Force One.' I don't mean he saves the day; I mean he almost saves the movie.\n",
        "The stalking struggle between reason and unreason that precedes it is much more gripping--and fun.\n",
        "It's a gamble. Air Force One goes against the current grain of presenting presidents in movies as evil or idiotic, or mock heroic, as in last year's 'Independence Day.'\n",
        "As it is, the movie is a roller coaster ride for those who prefer not to think once the theater lights have dimmed.\n",
        "The two hours of this movie felt like such an eternity that I was certain my clothes were going to be out of style by the time it was over.\n",
        "Air Force One gets the job done.\n",
        "Preposterous but viscerally juicy\n",

        "A Reagan youth's wet dream of underwater ballistics and East-West conflict.\n",
        "One of those ambitious, over-reaching disappointments that is more interesting than some more conservative successes.\n",
        "The film's uniqueness lies in its remarkable emotional open-heartedness.\n",
        "The performances, especially by the two young stars, are as surprising as they are sure.\n",
        "An essential testament to the beauty and chops of the late River Phoenix...\n",
        "The achievement of this film is that is wants to evoke that state of drifting need, and it does.\n",
        "Even though it falters toward the end, it soars above the fray.\n",
        "Fast-moving and very funny.\n",
        "Actually, the funniest parts of the movie are excerpts from the film that Cameron is originally nominated for.\n",
        "Basically a one-joke farce that plays around with a once-delicate subject that by now is a mainstay even on TV.\n",
        "The Hollywood stuff at the beginning with Glenn Close as an Oscar presenter and Matt Dillon as a puffed-up star on the rise is as funny and as nasty as anything in Libby Gelman-Waxner's columns.\n",
        "Oz wants it both ways, though, and can't resist hammering home the message with a prolonged Spartacus-style climax quite as ludicrous as the Oscar winning film-within-the-film.\n",

        "In a year when good comedies seem as hard to make as ever, In and Out is one of the best.\n",
        "For the most part, this hilarious caper's gay characters are knee-deep in the American mainstream.\n",
        "A truly funny, sophisticated, compassionate, mainstream Hollywood comedy about very modern homosexuality.\n",
        "...The Edge's fusion of Mametspeak with a true life adventure remains brawny entertainment, even it it is difficult to take as seriously as the filmmakers intend.\n",
        "It's subtly funny in the way it toys with the cliches of the genre.\n",
        "...The Edge is not only half-baked, warmed-over Hemingway.\n",
        "The Edge succeeds ably in blending his famously acerbic dialogue with nerve-racking adventure scenes.\n",
        "But it's too predictable by half, and Mamet's profundities have more volume than mass.\n",
        "I laughed frequently, but the problem is that I'm not sure the director intended there to be as much humor in his film as I uncovered.\n",
        "...a solid man-against-nature tale...\n",
        "Anthony Hopkins' first action movie casts him as a gentle, brainy tycoon stuck in the Alaskan wilderness with only voracious bears and, just as threatening, Alec Baldwin for company.\n",
        "Hops the globe like an old Bob Hope troop show in a futilely frenzied attempt to obscure script weaknesses.\n",
        "With its plot that zigs and zags like knife slashes, its cynicism stoked to the melting point, the movie brings the thrill of corruption crackingly to life.\n",
        "You have to pay close attention to follow the double-crossing intricacies of the plot, but the reward for your work is dark and dirty fun.\n",
        "Stop reading. Put this review on hold until after you've seen L.A. Confidential.\n",
        "An irresistible treat with enough narrative twists and memorable characters for a half-dozen films.\n",
        "This movie restores genre elements to a level of potency that's disturbing, satisfying, and rare as hell.\n",
        "A parlor game has already begun as to whether the supreme acting revelation in L.A. Confidential is provided by Mr. Crowe, Mr. Spacey or Mr. Pearce.\n",
        "As the emotional nexus, a Veronica Lake lookalike trapped in a web of male desires, Basinger is arguably the pick of a perfect cast. Subtle, shocking, compelling and immensely assured.\n",
        "A rattling good police story and a dark, laughing tone poem to the never-innocent city of illusions.\n",
        "Against all odds, L.A. Confidential succeeds brilliantly, right down to Jerry Goldsmith's score, which evokes his haunting theme from Chinatown without being haunted by it.\n",
        "Its intricate plot is so nihilistic and cold around the heart, its nominal heroes so amoral, so willing to sell out anyone and everyone, that the film is as initially unnerving as it is finally irresistible.\n",
        "Crooked cops. The mystery and allure of Hollywood in the '50s. Death, double-crossing, and secret alliances. Paparazzi waiting to get that one breakthrough picture.\n",

        "Fun, if you have the stomach for it.\n",
        "Curtis Hanson's resplendently wicked L.A. Confidential is a tough, gorgeous, vastly entertaining throwback to the Hollywood that did things right.\n",
        "Try to imagine this: a mainstream American movie, rife with violent and often murderous behavior, yet so densely plotted, so richly peopled, that you can't summarize it in a sentence.\n",
        "Hollywood filmmaking at its best.\n",
        "It's the story of good white actors stranded, in the name of noir, in a movie that refuses to kick into gear until it's far too late.\n",
        "L.A. Confidential walks on the dark side, enticingly daring us to follow.\n",
        "L.A. Confidential is immersed in the atmosphere and lore of film noir, but it doesn't seem like a period picture--it believes its noir values and isn't just using them for decoration.\n",
        "It's a film that has substance and sweep to match its high sense of style.\n",
        "Pitt is no disgrace but is blown off the screen by a bright-eyed adolescent actor.\n",

        "Soul Food aims to be a banquet of feelings, but mostly it serves up tripe.\n",
        "The steaming platters of fried catfish, macaroni and cheese, sweet corn bread, and black-eyed peas that appear early and often in writer-director George Tillman Jr.'s sentimental family drama should be listed in the credits as costars.\n",
        "Soul Food serves up family melodrama-cum-comedy that's tasty and satisfying, if not particularly profound or original.\n",
        "Tillman is tremendously skilled at bridging the vast shifts in tone.\n",
        "A hearty, old fashioned meal of a film.\n",
        "A warm, funny, touching African American family drama, the kind of bittersweet melodrama that critics tend to relegate as crowd-pleasing corn. We could use more when it's this well done.\n",
        "Tasty, but easily forgotten.\n",
        "Tillman drew inspiration from his own Milwaukee family, his beloved grandmother in particular. Humor, sentiment and melodrama strike a balance as he brings to life nine major characters and a host of others as well.\n",
        "George Tillman says Soul Food is based in part on his own family, and I believe him, because he seems to know the characters so well; by the film's end, so do we.\n",
        "There's a fine line between good, solid drama and the sudsiness of a soap opera, and, although there are times when Soul Food crosses over, the movie remains predominantly on the right side.\n",
        "An attractive cast and lingering shots of artery-busting delights that amount to pigout pornography.\n",
        "This new menu movie has a soapy plot, appealing stars, family values, down-home atmosphere and a conviction that there's rarely a problem fried chicken can't cure. There sure are worse ways of looking at the world than that.\n",
        "Includes an all-star horror cast.\n",
        "My best advice to anyone reading this review -- even someone who considers himself or herself a fan of horror movies -- is to stay away.\n",
        "An extravaganza of bad special effects and worse acting\n",
        "It will be of interest to none but goreheads, who are likely to find the gore rather cheesy.\n",
        "From the first frame, a silhouetted barn and windmill at dawn, the images feel prefab, and the all-purpose wistful tinkly piano and sighing strings pin them even more boringly down.\n",
        "Cry, cry, cry. Hug, hug, hug. Yadda, yadda, yadda.\n",
        "Owing more to the spirit of Oprah than to the Bard, pic serves up an earnest but unconvincing stew of received notions about family dysfunction, awkwardly put across by a script wheezing with melodramatic contrivances.\n",
        "The story is just an empty, manipulative compilation of tragedies and misunderstandings.\n",
        "In many ways, it has less in common with Shakespeare's tragedy than with Stephen King's Iowa-set horror story, Children of the Corn.\n",
        "Robards' senile paterfamilias is, regrettably, a grave embarrassment.\n",
        "Don't blame the actors. Their efforts succeed in keeping the bad news from the audience for almost half the picture.\n",
        "The film substitutes prejudices for ideas, formula feminism for character studies, and a signposted plot for a well-told story.\n",
        "Although the plot is undeniably overwrought at times, the characters remain strong and reliable, and it's their believability that pulls us through.\n",
        "Think obsessive-compulsive Lady Macbeth or Ophelia with an eating disorder, and you have an idea of just how simplistic that seems.\n",
        "That Jane Smileya(TM)s A Thousand Acres would become a movie was inevitable. Another virtual certainty was its bowdlerization.\n",
        "It's a mess, though one inevitably worth seeing by curious readers or fans of the cast who just won't be deterred.\n",
        "Ploddingly literal, A Thousand Acres is basically a star vehicle that relies on superior acting to redeem it. It does have superior acting, but that's not nearly enough.\n",
        "This 1997 thriller is fairly entertaining nonsense if all you're looking for is 128 minutes of diversion. But if you'd like something more from David Fincher, the director of Seven, don't get your hopes up.\n",
        "Regardless of how far one chooses to buy into The Game -- and the ending ambiguously suggests that it could go on and on -- there is no doubt as to Fincher's staggering expertise as a director and his almost clinical sense of precision.\n",
        "The film's 'message' about complacency transformed by chaos and uncertainty is hackneyed...\n",
        "The picture provides Douglas with one of his best roles. If he doesn't quite reach the bizarre heights he achieved in Falling Down, The Game makes its own demands.\n",
        "A crowd-pleasing pip most of the way.\n",
        "As it's unspooling on screen, the film is hugely entertaining, but there are several significant plot holes that grow wider the more closely they're investigated.\n",
        "Fincher is still working on the assumption that he has better things to do than entertain an audience. Which would be fine if he weren't drawn to such schlocky material.\n",
        "Douglas is the right actor for the role. He can play smart, he can play cold, and he can play angry. He is also subtle enough that he never arrives at an emotional plateau before the film does, and never overplays the process of his inner change.\n",
        "It's like the most hideously overproduced episode of The Twilight Zone on record, complete with a last twist that pretty much reduces what came before to soap bubbles.\n",
        "Douglas, who delivers a new shade of cruel elegance each time he plays another urbane monster, is the ideal star for this vigorously contrived thriller.\n",
        "The Game is an intensely exciting puzzle-gimmick thriller, the kind of movie that lets you know from the start that it's slyly aware of its own absurdity (which is why it can then get away with it).\n",
        "As a movie, it's a piece of drivel.\n",
        "By-the-book stuff, but that's what's expected whenever the name 'Steven Seagal' tops the marquee.\n",
        "There are movies that you know can't be any good, so they'd better be great. Fire Down Below ... achieves that grand level of absurdity.\n",
        "Seagal barely works up a sweat... He certainly doesn't work up any drama.\n",
        "One big self-distraction and nothing that vaguely resembles a real film.\n",
        "The stylistic fun Stone has in dramatizing this crime of passion thoroughly revitalizes the well-worked genre.\n",
        "Penn turns in a crisp, unfussy comic performance, Lopez vamps like a scorpion in heat, Nolte sustains a pretty good John Huston impression, and Thornton is mighty peculiar as the mechanic from hell.\n",
        "It's a disappointing ride.\n",
        "It's so empty emotionally it's difficult to see what the point is, unless it's the celebration of emptiness, an aim that has become so familiar recently it hardly seems worth the trouble everyone has gone to.\n",
        "It demonstrates a filmmaker in complete command of his craft and with little control over his impulses.\n",
        "The film takes so many detours that at least one or two of them are bound to surprise even the most jaded movie-goer.\n",
        "Although many of the performances -- particularly from Nolte, Penn and Thornton -- are enjoyable, the movie plunges so deeply into black comedic hell, all is lost.\n",
        "Stone the propagandist was insufferable, but as a cynic he's even worse.\n",
        "A sometimes uproarious minor work.\n",
        "This is a repetitive, pointless exercise in genre filmmaking -- the kind of movie where you distract yourself by making a list of the sources.\n",
        "Stone has stretched this rubber band past the point where it should snap into parody, but it still holds the shape of a rubber band.\n",
        "U-Turn becomes a showcase for the filmmaker's terrific arsenal of visual mannerisms and free-association imagery.\n",
        "This low-key drama is played slow and sage.\n",
        "One of those unexpected pleasures that combines a low budget with a high emotional impact.\n",
        "A modest delight.\n",
        "This is no bakery-grade honey.\n",
        "There is a quality about this film's use of deliberation that comes at times wonderfully close to magic.\n",
        "An emotionally honest low-ebber that builds to a satisfying wrap-up.\n",
        "Another of those quiet and affecting films from resolutely independent filmmaker Victor Nunez.\n",
        "Nunez's script is thoughtful and intelligent, and it challenges his actors with fully-formed personalities for them to breathe life into...\n",
        "Shamelessly metaphorical in ways that will embarrass all but a few generous souls.\n",
        "It would be accurate but barely adequate to call this the finest work of Mr. Fonda's career.\n",
        "Peter Fonda here reveals a depth of talent we did not suspect.\n",
        "The attentive way Nunez films his entire cast is as resourceful and evocative as the way he films his locations...\n",
        "With their matching hipster goatees and deadpan cynicism, Affleck and Lee evince the easy rapport of old buds.\n",
        "There is a lot of frank conversation about the technical aspects of sex between women, but Holden and Banky are written more like sniggering eighth graders than inquisitive adults.\n",
        "As in Smith's debut film, Clerks, there's something about the scruffy Chasing Amy that breaks through the pretenses of more conventional movies.\n",
        "Even when its young, uncertain characters appear to be in danger of talking (and whining) themselves to death, there's something genuine and charmingly naive about their attempts to make sense of their feelings.\n",
        "Chasing Amy is not yet a mature work Smith still needs a style to go with his sensibility but its yearning for maturity is palpable and touching.\n",
        "The performances are universally strong. The goateed Affleck makes for a particularly sympathetic protagonist; he has the looks and confidence of a lady-killer, but nagging befuddlement and vulnerability are rarely far from the surface.\n",
        "Smith isn't just fooling around anymore.\n",
        "The third time out is the real charm for writer-director Kevin Smith.\n",
        "Neither PC nor crudely anti-PC, this tough and tender movie, like its characters, is prepared to take emotional risks, and the comic book milieu is deftly sketched in.\n",
        "Amusing and appealing.\n",
        "Instead of cool twenty-something irony, Smith startles us with raw emotional honesty.\n",
        "The script moves beyond Smith's customary cataloguing of male adolescent ignorance and idiocy to offer sharp insights into the romanticism and pragmatism, pride and double standards that define the tangled threesome.\n",
        "Smith is at his best when he's letting his movie be silly. The more he chases significance, the more Chasing Amy fails to find its way.\n",
        "Can a script exploring some truly deep questions about human sexuality and emotions be any shoddier and wooden? Will Miramax continue to fund one of the worst directors in the business? Don't stay tuned.\n",
        "It's a rude blast of gleeful provocation, a farce about emotional pain, a drama about sexual slapstick.\n",
        "Work of such fierce intelligence and emotional honesty that it blows away the competition when it comes to contemporary romantic comedy.\n",
        "While the surface of his film sparkles with sharp, ironic dialogue, deeper issues are forming, and Chasing Amy develops into a film of touching insights.\n",
        "It's too loud, sometimes, and it's always pushy, but it's got heart.\n",
        "What Smith does best in Chasing Amy is write clever, raunchy and emotionally true-to-life dialogue, particularly in the arguments between Holden and Alyssa.\n",
        "Often funny but ultimately wrenching\n",
        "It's a familiar show-biz routine but one that's spangled with happy surprises and sharp acting.\n",
        "Centering on a lesser-known chapter in the reign of Queen Victoria, this richly detailed drama about her intimate relationship with her servant that scandalized the country is extremely well-acted; Judi Dench deserves an Oscar nomination\n",
        "Dench is magnificent as Victoria, a toy-sized, black-suited, dough girl of despair, a woman slowly recovering her wits and her expectations.\n",
        "''Mrs. Brown'' transcends its period setting not only with a keenly observed struggle between love and duty but also with the kind of controversy that envelops the Queen and her servant.\n",
        "Even as the film teases us with the underlying ''sensuality'' of the relationship, it fails to portray it as a convincing human bond. Mrs. Brown is stately yet depressed, like Victoria.\n",
        "...competent but uninspired...\n",
        "A smart, sharply drawn genre film with a moral center and a solid cast.\n",
        "...fun, energetic and fairly scary.\n",
        "The payoff is less effective. It involves several teen-scream modules, such as the $1.98 Startle Effect; the Hand on the Shoulder; and the Is He Dead Yet? gambit.\n",
        "Remember all those terrible slasher flicks from the '80s? This could be one of them. It certainly ain't no Scream.\n",
        "Predictably, the derivative title here is a jumping-off point for another derivative slasher-revenge pic.\n",
        "Like Williamson, Jim Gillespie, the director, respects the conventions of the genre.\n",
        "The characters aren't interesting enough for us to be scared for them.\n",
        "The best shot in this film is the first one. Not a good sign.\n",
        "Regrettably, an overblown finale and redundant trick ending undercut the mild subversiveness of what's gone before.\n",
        "[Hackford] seems stuck in a private limbo, unable to decide whether he's making a special-effects flick or a pop-philosophical tract.\n",
        "The movie's greatest strength is that it becomes more complex and rewarding as it goes along.\n",
        "Although it's nice for a film to be ambitious, there is such a thing as overreaching.\n",
        "The movie never fully engaged me; my mind raced ahead of the plot, and the John Grisham stuff clashed with the Exorcist stuff.\n",
        "As the movie approaches 2 1/4 hours, it begins feeling like eternal damnation.\n",
        "The picture starts off slick and amusing, gets convoluted, draggy and strange round about the midway point, and ends up just plain ludicrous.\n",
        "A highly enjoyable motion picture that's part character study, part supernatural thriller, and part morality play.\n",
        "Lurid advance ads for Devil's Advocate make it look ridiculous. It's not.\n",
        "A medical-underworld thriller that teaches the star of TV's The X-Files something about Z-grade theatrical pics.\n",
        "Bujold has the frazzled hauteur of an aging, neglected star, and Spelling is nicely glazed, studiously artless. But the film is keyed to Posey's performance: perfectly brittle, faultlessly false.\n",
        "[Waters] manages to open up the text while maintaining its perilous mix of arch wit, pathos and suspense.\n",
        "There's something quite lethal about Parker Posey in pearls, and for that inspiration director Mark Waters deserves our gratitude.\n",
        "This is a definitive Posey performance: wide-eyed, smiling and ultrafeminine, but plastic and cold as a store mannequin.\n",
        "There are many gaping holes between the funny moments.\n",
        "Not every chance taken by Mark Waters works, but enough are successful to produce some memorable motion picture moments.\n",
        "When the film was over I was not particularly pleased that I had seen it; it was mostly behavior and contrivance. While it was running, I was not bored.\n",
        "Presumably it worked far better onstage, where MacLeod's absurdist tale and self-conscious, Beckett-like wordplay probably found a friendlier context.\n",
        "There's isn't much tension here, and, if anything, the film is stolen by Maggie Smith and Judith Ivey as Finney's sisters.\n",
        "The Hungarian angle gives the film a little distinctiveness.\n",
        "I didn't care enough about Hawke's character to ignore a big problem in the story's logic: if this future has such incredible biotechnology, why can't Law just get his damaged body parts fixed?\n",
        "One of first Hollywood films about the effects of genetic engineering on human conduct, Andrew Niccol's directing debut is an intelligent and timely sci-fi that, despite some illogical plot contrivances, is emotionally engaging almost up to the end.\n",
        "Chilly, elegant, and a little bloodless.\n",
        "Designer babies rule dystopia in stylish SF thriller filled with recycled plot devices.\n",
        "It's far too serious to be taken seriously.\n",
        "An impressively fine-tuned first feature from Andrew Niccol.\n",
        "At a time when we read about cloned sheep and tomatoes crossed with fish, the science in Gattaca is theoretically possible.\n",
        "If smart sci-fi is your vial of tea, Gattaca won't disappoint.\n",
        "The hero's struggle in Gattaca would have been more compelling were he an average fellow going up against geniuses, and not a healthy fellow going up against somewhat healthier specimens.\n",
        "Gattaca doesn't just function as a science fiction thriller, but as both a cautionary tale about the dangers of letting scientific ability outstrip ethics and as a morality play about the irrationality of bigotry.\n",
        "When they sculpted the DNA for the perfect race in Gattaca, somebody left out the gene for self-knowledge.\n",
        "Flits, falters and falls flat.\n",
        "My own reaction to the current version fashioned by Mr. Schumacher is one of pure stupefaction.\n",
        "The plot is impressively free of anything that does not smell of unpasteurized melodrama.\n",
        "Takes everything that's wrong with Broadway and puts it on the big screen in a gaudy splat.\n",
        "This guy's not the Phantom of the Opera, he's the Fashionably Scarred Stud of the Opera and that just doesn't work.\n",
        "Joel Schumacher's film adaptation of Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera combines fingernails-on- blackboard audio agony with bamboo- under- fingernails physical torture.\n",
        "The movie version of Lloyd Webber's swooning 1986 horror operetta has been directed, by Joel Schumacher, as if Schumacher were the world's hardest-working upholstery salesman.\n",
        "The movie version of Lloyd Webber's smash hit does to the music what the music did to the words and story: It distracts the mind and cajoles the eyes to the point that one doesn't really care that everything the ears are hearing is pure nonsense.\n",
        "For those whose primary experience with musicals is on the screen, this melodramatic tale with the familiar soundtrack should hold substantial appeal.\n",
        "The film overflows with overkill, from the amped-up orchestra that constantly threatens to submerge the singers to the ornate silliness of each and every scene involving the Phantom.\n",
        "It's a shamelessly over-the-top wallow in romantic obsession, and a thoroughly enjoyable one.\n",
        "The movie misfires as often as it connects.\n",
        "It was the '80s. You really had to be there. Preferably with low expectations.\n",
        "If you want something more from musicals than a single syrupy hit, though -- and have fond memories of the Phantom as our most romantic of monsters -- then seek out the old Lon Chaney silent instead, and put on your own darn music.\n",
        "The falling chandelier, the signature moment of Phantom, has been moved from the end of the first act to the climax of the movie -- by which point non-devotees may need to be roused from their sleep by their companions.\n",
        "Andrew Lloyd Webber's kitschy theatrical spectacle is now a kitschy theatrical movie, a mix of melodrama, horror, romance, mystery and melody heaped together into a cinematic smorgasbord, one heavy in starch.\n",
        "Where's Homeland Security when you need it?\n",
        "Schumacher has bravely taken aboard this dreck and made of it a movie I am pleased to have seen.\n",
        "Rarely has so much of so little consequence been so closely examined.\n",
        "Sometimes Wonderland does make you wonder why you're wasting your time with these losers. But there's also a lot here that stays with you.\n",
        "The main interest here is the acting, which is, by turns, entertaining or just entertainingly bad, with lots of grungy seriousness and Method-trained twitching, but also some moments of real gusto.\n",
        "A film whose effects are as hard to wash away as blood.\n",
        "Overblown, overheated, overdirected, overacted, overlong and over here, in the local bijoux.\n",
        "Not quite the second coming of Boogie Nights.\n",
        "If for some reason you are fascinated by the Wonderland murders, look up the Rolling Stone article of 1989 that brought national attention to the gruesome case. Otherwise, your local cineplex has lots of choices with more redeeming social value.\n",
        "Wonderland never gives us a single reason to care about any of these people.\n",
        "Wonderland may not be the feel-good movie of the year; in fact it feels pretty lousy most of the time. But it offers a dark story well-told with some truly fine performances.\n",
        "An unsettling, sordid, overly stylized and intensely well-done drama.\n",
        "For all Wonderland's kinetic energy, the mind wanders.\n",
        "True crime procedurals can have a certain fascination, but not when they're jumbled glimpses of what might or might not have happened involving a lot of empty people whose main claim to fame is that they're dead.\n",
        "Wonderland skips lightly along the sewers of human depravity as if the trip alone was worth the telling.\n",
        "A dry, forensic account, more suitable for a true-crime show on late-night cable.\n",
        "Muddled and largely unentertaining.\n",
        "Wonderland is in your face. Any deeper connections, like those to heart and mind, get lost in the splash.\n",
        "The film reveals no great truths about human nature or drug abuse, the dialogue is witless, the acting unconstrained.\n",
        "Although Wonderland isn't much of a movie, it is a parade of exceptional acting.\n",
        "Wonderland aspires to the grisly poetry of a James Ellroy novella but only achieves the ugliness of an 8-mm loop.\n",
        "Wonderland is fast and frenetic and so unvarnished that it can make you feel unclean watching it.\n",
        "Flippantly hip without any solid laughs, Life strains to be the flick more offbeat.\n",
        "Facile and unpersuasive.\n",
        "The movie's dogged humorlessness, and its sixties-style cant, don't do justice to all the political crosscurrents in this story.\n",
        "A reminder that there's still a lot to be said for the good old-fashioned inspirational Hollywood movie.\n",
        "Give director Norman Jewison credit for two things: 1) He made the movie; 2) He let Washington run away with it.\n",
        "Its celebration of a spirit that refused to go down for the count is the important thing here, and Washington gets it shiningly right.\n",
        "The Hurricane has real mythic power.\n",
        "The last great performance of 1999, and arguably the best of the lot as well.\n",
        "One of Denzel Washington's great performances, on a par with his work in Malcolm X.\n",
        "An expertly crafted, deeply moving film.\n",
        "Occasionally riveting.\n",
        "Stirring but schmaltzy.\n",
        "Fashioned with the kind of classic Hollywood professionalism that's fast becoming a rarity at the movies.\n",
        "This movie about the nightmare of incarceration makes you taste the meaning of freedom.\n",
        "The story never radiates much beyond the corruption of Carter's lifelong enemy, Paterson detective Vincent Della Pesca.\n",
        "The Hurricane delivers a mighty emotional load, most of it borne on the broad shoulders of a great actor hitting his prime.\n",
        "Jewison has delivered another excellent film.\n",
        "It's a measure of Washington's strengths that he swims while the film sinks.\n",
        "Like broccoli, The Hurricane is good for you.\n",
        "An extraordinary story by any measure.\n",
        "Beautifully crafted and uplifting.\n",
        "Subplots are woven stealthily into the story, taking the pressure off the central drama, allowing it to be affecting rather than melodramatic, and heightening the atmosphere of the lush Louisiana setting.\n",
        "A sparkling directorial debut.\n",
        "An intensely emotional drama that mixes elements of Southern Gothic with the kinds of characters and tensions that prevail in the plays of Southern writers like Tennessee Williams.\n",
        "Writer/director Kasi Lemmons shows sweet judgment here, doesn't caricature or demonise the errant father, and elicits a host of nuanced performances from women of all ages.\n",
        "A gothic and, for better or worse, poetic memoir about a young girl and her family of Creole aristocrats.\n",
        "In Eve's Bayou, Tennessee goes to Louisiana, and finds a familiar home. Tennessee Williams, that is.\n",
        "There has never been a film quite like Kasi Lemmons' shimmering Eve's Bayou.\n",
        "The direction is unobtrusive, and Lemmons' performers are up to speed. This is Lemmons' first time out as a director. I'll be interested in what she does next.\n",
        "For the viewer, it is a reminder that sometimes films can venture into the realms of poetry and dreams.\n",
        "Smollett, however, is a find with a smile that illuminates the screen -- the dominant performer in a uniformly well-acted film.\n",
        "A movie unto itself, a rousing, original yarn about family life that includes everyone.\n",
        "A fascinating tale of guilt, consequences, and voodoo.\n",
        "It would be a shame if Eve's Bayou, Kasi Lemmons' beautiful first feature film, gets pigeonholed as a \"black\" movie just because it has no white characters.\n",
        "Quaid is a one-note sadsack here and no natural action hero.\n",
        "Stripes will keep potential felons off the streets for two hours. Few people seem to be asking, these days, that movies do more.\n",
        "The balance of the film consists of time-tested commercial material, most of which is still working fine.\n",
        "[Reitmam] manages a reasonable success rate at pulling off the numerous verbal and sight gags with which the script is peppered.\n",
        "An anarchic slob movie, a celebration of all that is irreverent, reckless, foolhardy, undisciplined, and occasionally scatological. It's a lot of fun.\n",
        "Mr. Murray hasn't yet reached the point at which his routines can be sustained for more than 10 minutes at a time. But he has achieved a sardonically exaggerated calm that can be very entertaining.\n",
        "Rowan Atkinson's recalcitrant TV character is the hub of this 1997 feature that will disappoint fans and nonfans alike.\n",
        "Goes beyond awful to surreally awful.\n",
        "I groaned my way through this black -- and blue -- romantic comedy and then decided I liked it.\n",
        "It's as if Downey Sr.'s irreverence and off-the-wall humor couldn't quite co-exist with the heartfelt tribute he intends to make here to his wife and her fellow Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis sufferers.\n",
        "Hugo Pool, the first film in six years from former counterculture director Robert Downey sets new standards in wacko charmlessness.\n",
        "The best thing about this bizarre love story (follie de grandeur) between a female pool cleaner and immobile man in wheelchair is that it puts icon Robert Downey behind the camera after long absence; with some luck Patrick Dempsey should become a lead man\n",
        "The audience seems limited to the director's inner circle.\n",
        "Like David Mamet and relative newcomer Quentin Tarantino, Downey writes some of the best dialogue around, and his script sparkles with it.\n",
        "Although this flighty comic allegory about love and death in contemporary Los Angeles is wildly overacted, with loose ends flying everywhere, it still conveys an antic poignancy.\n",
        "This simplistic and obvious expose about the manipulative power of the news media (lazily acted by Travoilta and Hoffman) is so familiar that it's not going to upset or provoke anyone.\n",
        "A wanna-be event movie that merely reinvents the wheel.\n",
        "A crisp, rigorously unsentimental director, Winterbottom was a good choice for this project.\n",
        "A compelling but jumbled film that examines the line between journalistic detachment and passion.\n",
        "Welcome to Sarajevo isn't just the story of an outsider's perspective of the conflict; it's a compelling examination of the role the media played in reporting and shaping the average person's views of the war.\n",
        "Too often we sense that the actors are drifting and the story is at sea.\n",
        "Messy and visceral, with an articulate, pointed anger that's recognizably British, \"Welcome to Sarajevo\" hits with an impact that's not diminished by the fact that Sarajevo's uneasy peace has held.\n",
        "However closely they mirror the real experience of Mr. Nicholson and others, some of the shocks here are too sadly predictable.\n",
        "Loosely structured, it keeps its focus despite lots of dramatic wiggle room.\n",
        "Coppola has never been particularly known for his comic touch, but here he seems bent on leavening the melodrama with as many laughs as possible, and they are generally honest and well-earned.\n",
        "This competent, anonymous legal drama (scripted by Michael Herr) is the best John Grisham adaptation yet.\n",
        "Coppola adapted the novel himself, and he's done a good job of paring it down.\n",
        "Coppola has infused The Rainmaker with enough humor, character, honest emotion and storytelling style to make it one of the year's most entertaining movies.\n",
        "Satisfactory mainstream entertainment, with a handful of major actors in juicy minor roles tossed in for good measure.\n",
        "Voight proves again what a great character actor he's become by stealing the film as a country club-type defense lawyer with a julep tongue.\n",
        "The intelligence and subtlety of The Rainmaker took me by surprise.\n",
        "Francis Ford Coppola, who wrote and directed the film, has made the most of Grisham's ground-level realism.\n",
        "Despite Mr. Coppola's taste for moodier and more eclectic material, this mainstream opportunity pays off.\n",
        "Boogie Nights, an epic tale of porn, pleasure, and excess, offers a purer hit of exhilaration than any movie this year.\n",
        "Not since the mysteriously reclusive Terrence Malick has there been such an explosion of sheer talent on the American movie scene.\n",
        "Considering the potentially explosive nature of the yarn, set in the porn world, Anderson's strategy is remarkably nonjudgmental and nonsensationalistic, largely due to his love and respect for all the characters and his impressive storytelling skills.\n",
        "In terms of sweep, ambition and precocious cinematic competence, it heralds the arrival of a new talent.\n",
        "With Boogie Nights we know we're not just watching episodes from disparate lives but a panorama of recent social history, rendered in bold, exuberant colors.\n",
        "The film is bemused and entertained, as we are, by this pack of sexual extremists, and the eye it casts on them is both benevolent and wry.\n",
        "Boogie Nights is truly audacious because Anderson doesn't beat you over the head with his daring. In the first half, he goes about turning conventional morality on its head nonchalantly, almost sweetly.\n",
        "As a writer and director, Paul Thomas Anderson is a skilled reporter who fills his screen with understated, authentic details.\n",
        "Everything about Boogie Nights is interestingly unexpected, even the few seconds of darkness before the film's neon title blasts onto the screen. The director, Paul Thomas Anderson, [displays talent that] is as big and exuberant as skywriting.\n",
        "A concise, vigorously told yarn with a strong point of view and a deftly juggled cast containing at least a few familiar faces.\n",
        "Boogie Nights isn't just an expose of the porn industry -- it's a provocative and involving character study, as well.\n",
        "Weir, an Australian filming in this country for the first time, has succumbed to blandness.\n",
        "A moderately effective, highly affected thriller.\n",
        "Witness warms up as the attraction builds between Ford, McGillis and Haas -- all performing excellently through this portion.\n",
        "Playing John Book allowed viewers the opportunity to see Ford the actor instead of Ford the action/adventure icon. It is one of the few times he has been given the opportunity to play in a straight drama.\n",
        "Powerful, assured, full of beautiful imagery and thankfully devoid of easy moralising, it also offers a performance of surprising skill and sensitivity from Ford.\n",
        "Harrison Ford has never given a better performance in a movie.\n",
        "It's pretty to look at and it contains a number of good performances, but there is something exhausting about its neat balancing of opposing manners and values.\n",
        "Lacks the courage of the book's fascist conclusions.\n",
        "Lacking the sophistication of the average comic book, it compensates with panoramic attack sequences, reminiscent of the Japanese swarm attacks in American war movies.\n",
        "A jaw-dropping experience, so rigorously one-dimensional and free from even the pretense of intelligence it's hard not to be astonished and even mesmerized by what is on the screen.\n",

        "Manages to be both fun and shocking -- sometimes in the same shot.\n",
        "As written by Ed Neumeier, who also wrote Verhoeven's much tighter Robocop, Starship Troopers never gets over its 180-degree swivel from teen-age love story to murderous destruction.\n",
        "Maybe the filmmakers are so lost in their slambang visual effects that they don't give a hoot about the movie's scariest implications.\n",
        "Director Paul Verhoeven is back in his subversively nimble RoboCop groove with the uproariously cheeky Starship Troopers.\n",
        "The action sequences are heavily laden with special effects, but curiously joyless.\n",
        "...it emerges as a magically entertaining blend of heart, soul, mind, wit, farce and, finally, an idyllic idealism.\n",
        "Lumet moves with confidence between satire and intriguing, heightened-reality spirituality.\n",
        "...a drily funny satire about America's health care woes...\n",
        "...the performances are juicy and intelligent.\n",
        "The most stimulating, satisfying aspect of this action fantasy is the theme music.\n",
        "It's a toss up which aspect of this drivel is worst.\n",
        "Pic consists largely of choppily edited fight scenes (usually involving somersaults and back flips) combined with various computer graphic effects.\n",
        "Quite serious, charmless and critic-proof.\n",
        "There's a kind of grand awfulness about it.\n",
        "Its dazzling special effects make its combatants flip and fly, spin and soar, all the while punching and kicking each other like jackhammers, only to leave viewers utterly unmoved.\n",
        "It's just an excuse for a series of tedious, repetitious fight scenes that have been staged with no hint whatsoever of originality.\n",
        "Here's the lowdown on the latest chapter in Mortal Kombat: deadly dull.\n",
        "The important thing is that Carrey and the filmmakers have taken pains to give Truman that soul -- which, in itself, provides a kind of depth. In any case, it gets you to care about how it's going to end.\n",
        "The movie might have been a soulless exercise without [Carrey]. With him, it has an authentic tremulousness, and also a dread, as if Pinocchio needed to take on Gepetto and Jiminy Crickett to become a real boy.\n",
        "It's a satire/comedy/fantasy about the future of television and the people caught in its omnipresent electronic net: a supremely intelligent jape about a man named Truman Burbank.\n",
        "Carrey is on his mettle, but you wonder why thirty years of close observation have made Truman so funny; shouldn't he be a regular guy gone mad?\n",
        "Its essential strengths are more dramatic and emotional than topical or satirical. Truman is a touchingly gallant creation, the hero of someone else's existential burlesque.\n",
        "A good, intelligent, insightful movie...\n",
        "One movie you can pronounce a modern classic with absolute confidence.\n",
        "This is a profound movie for people who don't like to think, or perhaps for people who are in the media and of the media, and can't imagine any life outside it.\n",
        "The result is a rarity on any screen: intelligent fun.\n",
        "Adventurous, provocative, even daring.\n",
        "A gemlike picture crafted with rare and immaculate precision...\n",
        "A brilliant and daring film that blends charming comedy, affecting drama, thought-provoking satire and even a touch of biblical parable.\n",
        "An appealing, offbeat, one-hundred minute diversion for those who really are tired of monsters tearing down buildings and action heroes saving the world.\n",
        "This is a film that can stay with one for a very long time after a viewing, and even slightly change the way one looks at life and the world.\n",
        "One of those high-concept movies whose concept is both clever and dumb.\n",
        "A bracingly intelligent, provocative and witty mix of entertainment values and long thoughts.\n",
        "Carrey turns Truman into a postmodern Capra hero.\n",
        "The underlying ideas made the movie more than just entertainment. Like Gattaca, the previous film written by Niccol, it brings into focus the new values that technology is forcing on humanity.\n",
        "This is a smart, engaging movie.\n",
        "The latter part of the film, depicting Truman's rebellion and providing him with a perfect final line, is much more conventionally conceived than its splendid start.\n",
        "[An] exquisitely mounted romantic gem.\n",
        "Director Marleen Gorris and screenwriter Eileen Atkins have done a remarkable job of suggesting the inner mental jumble Woolf strove to convey and constructing an exterior narrative of luminous beauty.\n",
        "A highly romantic, deeply melancholy drama, the film offers psychological and existential insights about the inevitable effects - and price - of life choices.\n",
        "The first act will be perplexing for those unfamiliar with the novel, but Redgrave's performance steers us through, and by the end we understand with complete, final clarity what the story was about.\n",
        "Vanessa Redgrave is such a majestic screen presence -- so luminous and wise -- that even the stilted \"Mrs. Dalloway\" is hard-pressed to dim her radiance.\n",
        "he film adaptation of ''Mrs. Dalloway'' is as elegantly wrought and reflective as the material allows (which is to say that in this case, a trip to the library makes for an invaluable part of the experience).\n",
        "The movie doesn't offer hash; it is well ordered, beautiful, and clear. But it does what movies do, not what Virginia Woolf does.\n",
        "Everything ... is dominated by actress Bai Ling, who creates a full-blooded character and role model for young girls.\n",
        "An ambitious, serious but not particularly stimulating musical feature that unconvincingly attempts to graft warm and cuddly family-film motifs onto turbulent aspects of modern history and mythology.\n",
        "Bluth has rediscovered the ingredients of quality mainstream animation...\n",
        "A gorgeous piece of work.\n",
        "Any film that echoes the landscape of Doctor Zhivago is hard to dislike for too long.\n",
        "Judging from their voices, about as close to Europe as most of these characters have ever gotten is probably Fresno.\n",
        "Flawed but not fatally, this ambitious epic's strength lies not just with its haunting melodies, pretty pictures, star voices and kid-friendly sidekicks -- the usual shtick that makes Disney tick.\n",
        "A promising launch for Fox's new animation studio, which has declared war on Disney.\n",
        "The whole process of watching Anastasia is a thoroughly enjoyable one, and it proves that any studio willing to put forth the time, money, and effort can match Disney.\n",
        "A one-note mix-up.\n",
        "In Amistad, an admirable but disappointing effort...[Speilberg] veers between stoic political correctness and mushy Hollywood platitudes.\n",
        "Spielberg seems to be dividing his filmmaking output into two distinct halves: in the summer months cranking out no-brainer dinosaur flicks...in the winter season unveiling his serious artistic stuff to edify the adults and woo the Oscar crowd.\n",
        "As Spielberg vehicles go, Amistad -- part mystery, action thriller, courtroom drama, even culture-clash comedy -- lands between the disturbing lyricism of Schindler's List and the storybook artificiality of The Color Purple.\n",
        "Halfway into Amistad comes the point where Steven Spielberg pulls the lever, and the stink and horror and bestialities of slavery spill around our ankles. We can't look away.\n",
        "The best parts of Amistad are those that simply bring their pride, fear and outrage to life.\n",
        "What is most valuable about Amistad is the way it provides faces and names for its African characters, whom the movies so often make into faceless victims.\n",
        "Amistad is prestige filmmaking bereft of inspiration -- sometimes even of the nuts and bolts of craft.\n",
        "Thematically rich, impeccably crafted, and intellectually stimulating, the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact.\n",
        "The screen version of Sherman's play about homosexuals in Nazi Germany shows that tyro director Mathias doesn't know much about film for his erratic approach and inconsistent style bring out the play's weaknesses, though the acting is good.\n",
        "Director Neil Jordan and Patrick McCabe adapted McCabe's novel for this bland 1998 shocker that fails miserably as satire, character study, and anything else it might have aspired to.\n",
        "Though the movie sometimes looks as if the authentic Irish wit, colour and blarney has been filtered through the sensibility of a Bunuel or Polanski, Jordan never allows the surreal/expressionist aspects to dominate.\n",
        "Neil Jordan's most accomplished and brilliant film to date, Butcher Boy is satisfying as faithful literary adaptation and inense cinematic experience that brings to mind in theme Kubrick's equally brilliant Cloakwork Orange.\n",
        "I find myself in an embarrassing position: I think this is a great movie, but I'm not sure.\n",
        "Instead of bathing his story in the warm, lyrical glow of an Irish lament, Jordan mixes domestic tragedy with fierce gallows humor and the stark horror of a Goya painting.\n",
        "Jordan is remarkable in his ability to reveal people's inner lives and the interaction between everyday life and an individual's imagination and driving passions.\n",
        "Anecdotal and increasingly chilling, The Butcher Boy moves from its early prankster spirit into parts unknown with the help of many pungent background touches.\n",
        "The Butcher Boy works best as a dark comedy and social satire, and is somewhat less successful as a character study of a deeply-troubled young boy whose violent impulses are fed by his unstable environment.\n",
        "Jordan's adaptation of The Butcher Boy (co-written with McCabe) remains a compelling exploration of the permeable border between normal childhood and full-on insanity.\n",
        "The movie held me outside; I didn't connect in the way I wanted to, and by the end I was out of sympathy with the material.\n",
        "The dialogue lacks snap, and Allen-the-actor's comic timing seems a beat off.\n",
        "Manage[s] to squeeze the very bounce out of what should have been a can't-miss update.\n",
        "for tube addicts who wish sitcoms were really, really long so they could be crammed with even more bedroom jokes, bathroom humor and 'nudge, nudge' line readings.\n",
        "An oppressively long cinematic oddball.\n",
        "It's a not-bad gift for those who prefer their laughs black.\n",
        "Some of this is insulting, all of it is tedious.\n",
        "It can't decide what it wants to be -- slasher fest, social satire or revenge comedy -- and ends up being an awkward goulash.\n",
        "It doesn't offer a single moment of visceral or emotional electricity.\n",
        "The rest of the cast of disposable archetypes deadpanned about why ''sequels suck'' -- a particularly funny joke, since this one didn't.\n",
        "Visceral, witty and appropriately redundant...\n",
        "If you liked Scream there's no reason you shouldn't like this sequel.\n",
        "The film itself is stuck in a cycle of repetition, with slight variations.\n",
        "Wes Craven was born to direct this material. One of the most successful of horror filmmakers.\n",
        "The movie is enjoyable.\n",
        "Williamson's script is funny and smart.\n",
        "A horror movie balancing gore and terror with personality, humor and a nifty gimmick.\n",
        "A yum-yum cast of pretties pull off the neat trick of affectionately counting the many ways available to horror sequels to suck, without making a sequel that sucks.\n",
        "Scream 2 is an ingenious, often hilarious, movie that does nothing to diminish the well-deserved cult reputation of its director.\n",
        "Scream 2 is a clever and wittily manipulative copycat sequel to Scream.\n",
        "Smart and scary like its predecessor, it delivers the shocks and a fair amount of sly wit.\n",
        "The real fun of Scream 2, like Scream, isn't seeing people slaughtered. It's the smart-mouth dialogue and in-joke ironies.\n",
        "Scream 2 has so much tongue-in-cheek trickery that it virtually escapes the horror genre.\n",
        "Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson have sharpened the focus along with their copycat killer's knives.\n",
        "There's enough ingenuity and scariness to please plenty of fans of the first film.\n",
        "If you liked Scream, you're going to like Scream 2, simple as that.\n",
        "A delicate and touching story.\n",
        "Canadian writer-director Atom Egoyan's most ambitious work to date, The Sweet Hereafter is a rich, complex meditation on the impact of a terrible tragedy on a small town.\n",
        "Though this is Egoyan's first adaptation, The Sweet Hereafter could serve as a model for how to do it right.\n",
        "Audience is almost bound to be absorbed for the duration.\n",
        "In a season of expertly adapted contemporary fiction (like \"L.A. Confidential\" and \"The Ice Storm\"), this fusion of Banks's and Egoyan's sensibilities stands as a particularly inspired mix.\n",
        "a new moral urgency seems to invigorate this film\n",
        "This is one of the best films of the year, an unflinching lament for the human condition.\n",
        "Elegiac and yet straightforward as haiku\n",
        "solemn, subtly structured, beautifully acted and ultimately hypnotic\n",
        "As in Egoyan's Exotica and The Adjuster, past and present are intricately fused by the crisp editing, the mournful shadings of Mychael Danna's score and Paul Sarossy's austere wide-screen cinematography\n",
        "The film searches for that place in the heart where we feel sadness and squeezes it persuasively.\n",
        "A beautiful elegy about family and community, death and healing...\n",
        "The movie has an impact that extends far beyond the walls of a movie theater - a quality shared by a distressingly few of today's releases.\n",
        "Cameron has devised a tender love story between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio that serves as the main focus of Titanic's storyline, and it works beautifully.\n",
        "If computer-generated special effects have overpowered human-generated drama, Cameron seizes that dangerously cold technology and recasts it as dream and delirium, profoundly human in its sources and longings.\n",
        "The execution is state-of-the-art and breathtaking. Titanic offers the full compass of courage and cowardice, and it stands as an achievement that truly is a night to remember at the movies.\n",
        "Titanic is indeed a ship of dreams. Climb aboard and bon voyage.\n",
        "Take one of history's most compelling tragedies, tell it through the lives of two engaging young lovers and show it with some of the best-ever special effects and you have a dazzling, exciting movie that is also poignant and personal.\n",
        "With his beatific, sweet, open face, DiCaprio gives us a rooting interest in hoping that someone important to us survives the wreck.\n",
        "We know the story ends badly but Cameron still sweeps us up in the romance between Kate Winslet's rebellious posh girl and DiCaprio's steerage kid.\n",
        "Cameron's three-hour disaster epic is a triumph of popular art -- of folk art, really.\n",
        "\"Titanic\" still amazes as the kind of massive, build-and-destroy production that few filmmakers have the ambition or budget to make.\n",
        "[Cameron] stages the sinking with a flawless sense of detail, pacing, import and dread.\n",
        "This version has deepened and enriched a film that was already rich in emotions and remarkable for its depth of detail.\n",
        "How is Titanic in 3D? The answer is pretty damn dazzling.\n",
        "Cameron is a genius at instilling narrative dread and designing a hokum-drenched fairy tale of a certain size.\n",
        "If any film should be redone in 3-D, it's \"Titanic.\" And if any filmmaker should be the one doing the redoing, it's James Cameron.\n",
        "Sure, it's corny, but there's something endearing about the tale of young love and its earnest lack of irony.\n",
        "Like Kathy Bates' \"unsinkable\" Molly Brown, \"Titanic\" is unabashedly American: It's big, brash and sometimes gauche, yet also unapologetically earnest, amazing to look at and devoted to its own cause. And it knows how to win us over.\n",
        "Overall, for a blockbuster movie about one great big thing hitting another great big thing, the new film shows distinctly upper-deck restraint.\n",
        "The letdown factor has been most keenly felt in conversions from 2D, but Titanic 3D shows how the ambition can be realized if the will and skill are there. We can only hope that other filmmakers follow Cameron's example.\n",
        "But the power of Titanic didn't come from originality; it came from punching cliches across with a seldom-seen directness and sincerity that seemed pure of heart, \"old-fashioned,\" or plain corny, depending on your perspective.\n",
        "James Cameron's spectacular new 3-D version of \"Titanic'' is everything I'd hoped for, and more.\n",
        "This thriller seems most interested in lingering over battered and bloodied male faces.\n",
        "Sarah Thorpe's screenplay is a compendium of by-the-book cliches; Kaufman's direction leaves the material stranded in a limbo between po-faced and trashy; Judd's approximation of drunkenness is worrying to behold.\n",
        "The outdated, cliche-riddled direction is so inept and indifferent that it's hard to believe Twisted was lensed by the same Philip Kaufman who made The Right Stuff.\n",
        "A suspense thriller without thrills or suspense.\n",
        "Judd is let down by Twisted because tearful, confused victim doesn't come naturally to her; she's not fun to watch suffer if you can't see her calculating the payback.\n",
        "This movie plays like they were reading [Roger Ebert's] little movie glossary and they took every cliche in there.\n",
        "Gives new meaning to the word 'obvious.'\n",
        "A nasty, formulaic and unforgivably obvious procedural.\n",
        "Philip Kaufman's Twisted amalgamates the basic post-feminist woman-cop premises of Silence Of The Lambs and the Prime Suspect TV series so torpidly it feels less like entertainment than a community service sentence.\n",
        "It's all perfectly rote and only occasionally satisfying.\n",
        "It begins pretty, and ends up ugly.\n",
        "The film is too simple to hold our interest for nearly two hours.\n",
        "A chill-deficient suspense flick that shares too much common ominous ground with [Judd's] past thrillers.\n",
        "Utterly devoid of suspense, energy or credibility.\n",
        "We can only regret that this is the kind of script [Kaufman's] being offered these days. Now, that's twisted.\n",
        "Bearable but hardly riveting.\n",
        "It's always rather sad to watch gifted performers stranded in a tepid thriller.\n",
        "As titles go, Twisted doesn't go quite far enough. Convoluted might have been better. Stretched also would have worked. Ridiculous would be most appropriate.\n",
        "The script is credited to Sarah Thorp but has all the hallmarks of one of those screenplays that has gotten worse with every rewrite.\n",
        "Another thriller. Another plot full of holes. Another waste of time.\n",
        "Earnest but evocative, and in moments touching, chronicle of the turbulent childhood of a Cherokee orphan during the Depression.\n",
        "Directing himself for the first time, Redford has lavished his usual meticulous care on popular material that comes alive on the screen in ways that it never could on the page.\n",
        "This has loads of craft and honor but never quite takes off.\n",
        "We are not talking postmodern or even modern here, but the best kind of old-fashioned.\n",
        "It's a film-maker's love letter to himself.\n",
        "That lack of identifiable passion is The Horse Whisperer's most vexing problem.\n",
        "What The Horse Whisperer loses in storybook romance it gains in rock-solid values and a stirringly profound respect for nature...\n",
        "As good as Redford and Scott Thomas are at the outset, they can't convey the passion necessary to make the affair believable.\n",
        "Redford seems to have fooled himself into thinking the story of The Horse Whisperer runs much deeper than it does.\n",
        "A film as rich in its visual presentation as it is in its emotional resonance.\n",
        "...an intelligent, lush-looking tale...\n",
        "...there is a magnificence in his treatment here that dignifies what is essentially a soap opera.\n",
        "The tale is filled with funny, gritty Tarantino lowlife gab and a respectable body count, but what is most striking is the film's gallantry and sweetness.\n",
        "Quentin Tarantino puts together a fairly intricate and relatively uninvolving money-smuggling plot, but his cast is so good that you probably won't feel cheated.\n",
        "The film is more Jarmusch than Peckinpah -- its soul is in the minutiae.\n",
        "Offers an abundance of pleasures, especially in the realm of characterization and atmosphere.\n",
        "It's like a scuzz-bucket film noir directed by Stanley Kubrick at his most static-mesmeric.\n",
        "Tarantino's finest, most mature movie to date.\n",
        "Working from an Elmore Leonard novel, Tarantino has created a gangster fiction that is never larger than life and sometimes smaller.\n",
        "Beyond the grasp of most directors, this is tour de force stuff -- definitely meriting the price of admission and almost worth the three-year wait.\n",
        "A leisurely and easygoing diversion that goes down easy enough but is far from compelling.\n",
        "Turns out that author Elmore Leonard and director Quentin Tarantino are not the odd couple after all.\n",
        "The flat, self-exposing dud that fate often keeps in store for the initially overpraised.\n",
        "Between Jackson's opining and De Niro's hopeless alibis when he messes up, Jackie is good for a bundle of bloody ho-ho-hos.\n",
        "Scene by scene, Jackie Brown is amusing, but after two hours, it seems sluggish, and at that point still has a half-hour to go.\n",
        "[Tarantino] wanted to give Grier a role worthy of her, and he has. If only he'd given her a movie worthy of her as well.\n",
        "An entertaining diversion, but not a masterpiece.\n",
        "[A] surprisingly sluggish Tarantino piece.\n",
        "For all its enthusiasm, this film isn't sharp enough to afford all the time it wastes on small talk, long drives, trips to the mall and favorite songs played on car radios.\n",
        "This is the movie that proves Tarantino is the real thing, and not just a two-film wonder boy.\n",
        "The music ties together all the pretty pictures, gives the narrative some momentum, and helps to induce a kind of alert detachment, so that you're neither especially interested nor especially bored.\n",
        "Scorsese has taken the harsh mystery out of Tibetan Buddhism, and out of its oppression, too.\n",
        "Disregarding commercial considerations, Scorsese's haunting meditation on Dalai Lama's early life is a majestic spectacle of images and sounds, but it's bogged down by a routine script that fails to offer fresh insights on Tibet's non-violent culture\n",
        "Urged on by Philip Glass's throbbing, blaring score, the director conjures a phenomenal, trance-like climax, owing more to dreams, second sight and the mind's eye than conventional dramatic rhetoric.\n",
        "A great film about a good man.\n",
        "Careful and respectful, it is everything a movie about the Dalai Lama should be except dramatically involving.\n",
        "I admire Kundun for being so unreservedly committed to its vision, for being willing to cut loose from audience expectations and follow its heart.\n",
        "Stunning, odd, glorious, calm and sensationally absorbing, director Martin Scorsese's Kundun is a remarkable piece of work with vital colors and a wrenching message.\n",
        "In imagining an exalted Buddhist version of a personal road not taken, Mr. Scorsese has made a film that is as much a prayer as it is a movie.\n",
        "Once you settle into the pace of the movie, you experience it as a continuous flow of incidents and images.\n",
        "Kundun is ceaselessly lovely to look at. But it is also exquisitely, meticulously, intently (gulp) ... dull.\n",
        "While Kundun boasts impressive cinematography (by Roger Deakins) and an effective score (by Philip Glass), the images and music aren't enough to hide the picture's essential hollowness.\n",
        "It's an extremely beautiful, boring movie.\n",
        "In many ways, a remarkable achievement but also a singularly undynamic entry in the director's canon\n",
        "Throughout the film cause and effect, the mainspring of most narratives, is replaced by a sense of spiritual synchronicity.\n",
        "Adds up to considerably less than the sum of its often scintillating parts.\n",
        "The result is a lot of laughs and a feeling of awe toward the craftsmanship involved. I doubt that there'll be anything else like it the rest of this year.\n",
        "Far from being shallow pastiche, it's actually about something: what it means to be a man, to be a friend, and to be a 'hero' for a particular time and place.\n",
        "A typical Coen brothers film is like no film you've ever seen.\n",
        "As tempting as it is to completely dismiss The Big Lebowski, it's hard to do because the Coens are able to create wickedly funny eccentrics and possess the ability to energize certain actors to inhabit them completely.\n",
        "The Big Lebowski is a mess. But what a glorious, wonderfully-entertaining mess it is.\n",
        "The Dude and Sobchak begin as caricatures too, but they're allowed to grow into something deeper, if only because the humanist economy of the Coens' surrealist vaudeville allows for a couple of human beings within the tapestry of freaks.\n",
        "It's weirdly engaging, like its hero.\n",
        "There are more ideas here, more wacko side characters and plot curlicues than the film can support, and inevitably it deflates from having to shoulder so much.\n",
        "A genial spoof about life on the unhinged margins of L.A. that's a lot more carefully constructed than it pretends to be.\n",
        "This plot need not be taken too seriously. Watching it amble along is enough of a treat, since the Coens populate this story with oddballs and bowling balls of such comic variety.\n",
        "Nearly everything in The Big Lebowski is a put-on, and all that leaves you with is the Coens' bizarrely over-deliberate, almost Teutonic form of rib nudging.\n",
        "The still strkingly beautiful Julie Christie renders such as glowing performance that she alone justifies viewing this incurable, frivolous romantic serio-comedy in which she plays B-Movie actress!\n",
        "How mysterious and intriguing some performances can be.\n",
        "Film is a fascinating documentation of an important chapter in the history of 20th century American intellectuals, but as such will have a limited audience.\n",

        "Denzel Washington has the almost impossible task of holding together a convoluted picture that's only intermittently suspenseful and not very engaging emotionally or intellectually.\n",
        "The first half of this movie holds some promise, but time is not on its side.\n",
        "God (or the Devil) is in the detail: every time a fluid is taken into the body, the fidgety camera zooms in, fascinated, suspicious.\n",
        "A stylish if seriously far-fetched nightmare.\n",
        "A crafty piece of work, ending with a pair of marvelous twists.\n",

        "If you have an interest in capital-letter Good and Evil, in the abstract-theological sense, Fallen could engross you.\n",
        "Unfortunately the film wafts toward Seven turf soon afterward and stalls on a heavy burden of metaphysical chitchat. Washington's dazzling good looks are the only reason to stick with it.\n",
        "The idea is better than the execution.\n",
        "Despite the negatives, I'm still recommending Fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending, which I loved.\n",
        "Fallen is not perfect, and eventually it even becomes frustrating. Threads remain loose, and the movie doesn't fully exploit its premise. Still, it would be churlish not to appreciate the ride.\n",
        "An unholy union between Seven and The Exorcist.\n",
        "An exhilarating rush of a movie, with all manner of go-for-broke visual bravura that expresses perfectly the free spirits of [Wong's] bold young people.\n",
        "I felt transported back to the 1960s films of Jean-Luc Godard. I was watching a film that was not afraid of its audience.\n",
        "Wong brings tremendous vigor and audacity to the effort, asking us to question the most basic rules of storytelling and commercial filmmaking.\n",

        "Once upon a time, it was funny.\n",
        "Once the new sequel gets past its cumbersome plotting and gets down to its music, it overrides the temptation to suggest buying the soundtrack recording and forgetting the rest.\n",
        "'I always thought there was another story to be told,' Landis says in the film's notes. Fine; then tell one.\n",

        "Dahl permeates the film with enough quirky detail ... and horror-movie staples ... to keep things interesting.\n",
        "A genuine thriller, guaranteed to whiten knuckles, grind enamel and render armrests into scrap.\n",
        "Much more effectively terrifying than the usual overplotted, underwritten Hollywood thriller.\n",
        "Anyone actually looking for a genuinely scary movie at this point will have a lot of fun with Joy Ride.\n",
        "Terrific escapist fare, stylish, outrageous and compelling.\n",

        "Three major stars being involved, it all wraps up happily but implausibly.\n",
        "The ending, though emotionally satisfying, collapses under scrutiny. This lack of payoff is a real flaw in a film pitched to a discriminating sci-fi mentality.\n",
        "Given its situational premise -- outer space goes underwater -- Sphere is filled with visual potential, yet Levinson can't tap it. He's just a whole lot more comfortable trying to tame the human software than the technical hardware.\n",
        "As the umpteenth entrant in the We-Are-Not-Alone sweepstakes, Sphere feels awfully familiar because it is.\n",
        "Somewhere out there, maybe there's a small cadre of film-goers who will appreciate Sphere's dubious charms, but I'm not among them.\n",
        "While this is no quick-witted treat on a par with Mr. Levinson's Wag the Dog, it's a solid thriller with showy scientific overtones.\n",
        "Sphere winds up just a load of balls.\n",
        "The only excellence is in the acting, and even then the screenplay puts the characters through so many U-turns that dramatic momentum is impossible.\n",
        "There are some things that humankind is just better off not knowing about.\n",
        "My hope is that the sequels are actual attempts at movies. The world doesn't need any more toothless cinema.\n",
        "A deeply sincere, outright goofy vampire romance for the hot-not-to-trot abstinence set.\n",
        "Some will find it all too polite, but compared to rival blockbuster exercises in explosive CGI mayhem, its character-based index of longing and protectiveness at least provides a viable alternative moodscape.\n",

        "Twilight, the first movie adapted from Stephenie Meyer's series of best-selling teen novels, is going to be a big hit with young girls, and deservedly so -- the picture delivers.\n",
        "Twilight the movie is cautious, a sort of Tiger Beat-ified Twin Peaks. In its undercooked way, though, it's enjoyable.\n",
        "Twilight is silly and melodramatic and hard to dislike in much the same way as its target audience, with a distinctly teenage sense of tragedy.\n",
        "Twilight is the Diet Coke of vampire movies, but central to the film's success is that you believe in the love between Edward and Bella.\n",
        "Not that Twilight's fate hangs on intelligibility. It hangs on fangs that aren't bared, and on a bloodlust that isn't indulged.\n",
        "Twilight works as both love story and vampire story, thanks mainly to the performances of its principals.\n",
        "Twilight is, by its very nature, all about unfinished business, the story of a brooding, caring romantic hero and the woman who cannot -- although she wants to -- yield to him. Only his eyes penetrate her. For now, that's enough.\n",
        "My advice: Focus on Pattinson and Stewart. They make you understand why the books sold 17 million copies.\n",
        "Combines the plot of HBO's True Blood with the intensity level of Saved by the Bell.\n",
        "Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg does a decent job adapting the first book in Meyer's series, and despite a tendency toward cheesy effects, Hardwicke keeps things moving swiftly.\n",
        "Teenage girls are going to love Twilight, and many are sure to see it more than once. Hang on to those earplugs: This time next year, you'll need them again.\n",
        "Gothic wooziness stifles many of Hardwicke's lighter impulses, such as her knack for jiving humor in scenes among friends and family. And some of the more cartoonishly gymnastic CG stunts look plain silly.\n",
        "Hush is gussied up by its classy distaff cast members, but remains trashy all the same.\n",
        "Jessica Lange establishes a spark of interest in this psychological thriller with her giggly demonic performance. But the film never adds up to anything more than an elaborate tease.\n",
        "Hush has three very simple problems: it's incredibly dumb, it's incredibly boring, and it's incredibly predictable (at least up to the stupefying ending).\n",
        "Lange seems at a loss to know how to convey Martha's malevolence -- and writer-director Jonathan Darby offers almost no guidance.\n",
        "Hush is the kind of movie where you walk in, watch the first 10 minutes, know exactly where it's going, and hope devoutly that you're wrong.\n",
        "The film is so awful it doesn't even qualify as a B-movie.\n",
        "A handsome production that nicely evokes the 1920s and a likeable cast headed by McConaughey can't compensate for a Western-gangster film that's too diffuse and lacks a discernibel POV to be dramatically engaging.\n",
        "'Where the Wild Things Are' stands out for its unusually potent evocation of the timbre of childhood imagining, with its combination of the outre and the banal, grand schemes jumbled up with delicate feelings and the urge to smash things up.\n",
        "[Jonze has] achieved with the cinematic medium what Sendak did with words and pictures: He's grasped something true and terrifying about love at its most unconditional and voracious.\n",
        "Wild Things, you do not make my heart sing.\n",
        "Intellectually interesting, visually arresting and filled with invention, there's just one crucial thing Where the Wild Things Are is missing: wildness.\n",
        "Spike Jonze, we salute you.\n",
        "Director Spike Jonze gets that Max's subsequent journey to the far-off island of the wild things is nothing less than an odyssey into his mind.\n",
        "This blend of the real and unreal is successful because Jonze's feeling for childhood binds everything together.\n",
        "Some very good books were just never meant to be turned into movies. Sadly, you can now add Maurice Sendak's 1963 classic Where the Wild Things Are to that list.\n",
        "Where the Wild Things Are is audacious in its refusal to be reassuring, which makes it hard to love, but also hard to dismiss.\n",
        "It's a joy for thinking moviegoers of any age. It doesn't seek to \"keep out all the sadness,\" yet neither does it wallow in gloom. Instead it presents childhood as a journey filled with things both wonderful and fearful, and ultimately all of the mind.\n",
        "Where the Wild Things Are may not be a great film for children (or, at least, most children). But it is something rarer still: a great, and unsparing, film about childhood.\n",
        "The film is lacking as a whole -- it's individual moments and scenes that make it worth seeing.\n",
        "Jonze's ideas, visual and otherwise, spill out in a faux-philosophical ramble that isn't nearly as deep as he thinks it is; at best, it's a scrambled tone poem. Even the look of the picture becomes tiresome after a while.\n",
        "Where the Wild Things Are is a fiercely innovative film with surprising texture and nuance. It captures the joy and exuberance of childhood without shying away from its very real pains and woes.\n",
        "Where the Wild Things Are honors the book in every imaginable way, and in ways no one could have imagined until Spike Jonze and his collaborators came along.\n",
        "Sometimes you are better off with 10 sentences than tens of millions of dollars, and this is one of those times.\n",
        "Where the Wild Things Are is an alternately perfect and imperfect if always beautiful adaptation of the Maurice Sendak children's book.\n",
        "For all the money spent, the film's success is best measured by its simplicity and the purity of its innovation. Jonze has filmed a fantasy as if it were absolutely real, allowing us to see the world as Max sees it, full of beauty and terror.\n",
        "In an era glutted with sanitized, prefabricated, computer-generated kids' stuff, this is an experience of sophisticated cross-generational appeal. It digs deep into childhood's bright, manic exuberance and also its confusion and gloom.\n",
        "Paulie has moments of minor charm but lacks the magic to fully capture the imaginations of either children or adults.\n",
        "Shalhoub gives an impressively nuanced performance in the dangerously cliched role, and Paulie -- a combination of trained parrots, animatronics, and the voice of Mohr -- comes across as a fully developed character.\n",
        "A perfect family movie with the intelligence, humor and hug-me moments to be a great first-date movie, too. Just remember to bring a hankie.\n",
        "Unusual and surprisingly agreeable.\n",
        "The film is aimed at children, I suppose, although I don't think they'll like Paulie all that much. I didn't.\n",
        "Paulie has elements of a good weepy, but overall it never quite gels beyond being a passable novelty.\n",
        "It is something to behold.\n",
        "The kind of plodding, conventional fare usually reserved for TV movies.\n",
        "Takeshi Kitano, who made it, must be very serene or very angry; only extreme states allow such a narrow focus.\n",
        "As satire, it's toothless and indulgent; as drama of conscience, it's not a patch on real life...\n",
        "A smart and savvy piece of work.\n",
        "Travolta's warmth and expansiveness effectively amplify and embellish the likable and personable side of Stanton.\n",
        "Dramatically weak.\n",
        "The movie loses something by downplaying the book's arresting contrast between Stanton's smooth dishonesty and Picker's raw sincerity.\n",
        "The film seldom displays much in the way of directorial hallmarks.\n",
        "The movie is endlessly inventive and involving.\n",
        "A slack, tepid picture stuck in a no man's land between satire and drama.\n",
        "The movie itself makes no judgment. It's smart enough to ask you to do that by yourself and for yourself.\n",
        "This entertaining but rather peculiar movie asks extraordinary questions, and I wish it were better equipped to give the answers.\n",
        "Primary Colors is the Mr. Smith Goes to Washington of our jaded era.\n",
        "Adapting Joe Klein's roman a clef of the same name, ferociously witty screenwriter Elaine May and her smooth old compatriot in comedy, director Mike Nichols, have made a zingy drama and have staffed it well.\n",
        "A hilariously entertaining movie.\n",
        "There are piecemeal wonders in Primary Colors, but not the grand and resonant vision the film should have been.\n",
        "May and Nichols may not be right for the material, especially the Searching for Jimmy Stewart component, which feels more labored as the film proceeds.\n",
        "Like its politicians, the movie is savvy about using whatever it takes to achieve a goal.\n",
        "It's hard for me fully to express how deeply rotten I think Primary Colors is. Adjectives like 'glib,' 'coarse,' and 'sour' don't fully do it.\n",
        "Those who wonder how good a Clinton impersonation Travolta does miss the point.\n",
        "A wonderful family film that deals sensitively, and even with humor, with a fairly unusual situation for the screen: a 9-year-old's struggles with his faith in God.\n",
        "Children, too, will be bored to tears navigating through some of the talky spiritual gunk.\n",
        "I was aware of the problems, but that didn't diminish the warm, fuzzy glow I was experiencing.\n",
        "The fact is, just too many of the characters and plot points are right out of the stock room: the obligatory fat kid; the obligatory bully; the obligatory kid whose parents can't really afford Catholic school tuition ...\n",
        "Beneath its suffocating, smug sentimentality, you have to look hard to uncover a single moment of truth and genuine feeling.\n",
        "I wonder who the movie was made for.\n",
        "The young actresses Graham and Wagner here create two characters who feel whole, distinct and weighty.\n",
        "An edgy, gabby, salaciously subversive sex farce.\n",
        "You gotta admire a director who can come up with a way to hang out in such luxurious digs for two weeks, acting out sexual situations with three of the dishiest young actors in the business.\n",
        "A lively, if slender, perpetuation of the battle between the sexes on a modern battleground.\n",
        "Writer-director James Toback must believe his audience is hopelessly prudish if he thinks this pedantic story, which takes place over several hours in a Manhattan loft, is provocative.\n",
        "Toback has somehow managed to prolong and expand this sketchy egg-on-your-face situation with a series of unexpected ironies and power role reversals that are not without wit, humor and intelligence.\n",
        "A thoroughly engrossing, intelligent and enjoyable experience.\n",
        "A small movie with some big moments and a lot of unfinished business.\n",
        "Two Girls and a Guy isn't a satisfying movie, but Downey is alarmingly brilliant in it.\n",
        "Robert Downey Jr.'s Blake Allen is enough of a raging dynamo to find the dark humor and desperate romanticism at the heart of Mr. Toback's ego trip of a premise, and to make Blake sympathetic too.\n",
        "Wagner doesn't wink at the audience to let it know she's not as ignorant and naive as the character she plays. It's a performance that risks being misunderstood, and it probably will be.\n",
        "Downey's last scene knocks the wind out of you: You may feel you need a moment or two before you can get up out of your seat.\n",
        "Sometimes the story behind a movie can bring an angle to what's on the screen.\n",
        "A beautifully shot tracker's western that brings the Fordian poles of garden and desert to bear on the bushrangers' Outback, this is also a revenge drama of substantial horror.\n",
        "A visionary tale of a fragile civilizing impulse crushed by family loyalty and a lust for revenge in the vast Outback of the late 19th century.\n",
        "It doesn't offer much that hasn't already been said about lawless frontier towns, bonds between outlaws or the settling of the West.\n",
        "By the end, it all pays off exactly the way a hundred earlier Westerns did.\n",
        "In-your-face combativeness is The Proposition's power, and for those of you who value your westerns, the effect is not unlike that of The Wild Bunch or Unforgiven.\n",
        "It's fitting that The Proposition is set Down Under, because in many ways, it's a reverse Western.\n",
        "An intense piece of wilderness ugliness that mixes family, honor, decency, revenge, racism and mindless blood lust in a manner that satisfies even if it never astounds.\n",
        "The squeamish should skip this film. But its recurring violence seems justified in terms of the story Cave sets out to tell and is up a familiar alley for the songwriter who has an album called Murder Ballads.\n",
        "Murder ballad for the slice-and-dice age, a film of sensitive artistry laced with gore.\n",
        "This is the crucial proposition The Proposition misses: To make us truly despair about the face of violence, it must be firmly attached to someone we know, and not merely blown off someone we don't.\n",
        "A near-masterpiece of mood and menace, and one that deserves to be seen on the largest screen possible.\n",
        "It's consistently compelling and thought-provoking. This one will stay with you, and despite its disturbing moments, you'll welcome it.\n",
        "A revisionist western that brings its own brand of sanguinary honesty to the genre.\n",
        "Offering proportionate measures of raw violence and lyrical soliloquizing, the Peckinpah-influenced The Proposition is for those who prefer their western action unvarnished but immaculately framed.\n",
        "Hillcoat creates a vision as nihilistic as any horror film ever put on a screen, but so well acted and carefully conceived that it transcends exploitation.\n",
        "The movie gets at something primal in the pit of your stomach, something that speaks of loyalty and betrayal, of men's souls -- or the lack thereof.\n",
        "A pitiless yet elegiac Australian Western as caked with beauty as it is with blood.\n",
        "I'm guessing that Hillcoat wants us to see The Proposition as a howling, heartsick message from our savage selves. The story is ugly, but there's some beauty in the telling.\n",
        "Over the top, Down Under.\n",
        "The plot's hokey contrivances and the theatrical shtick tend to prevail over the sporadic moments of insight and emotional truth.\n",
        "It never persuades you it belongs on the big screen.\n",
        "The best romantic comedy so far this year.\n",
        "This comedy is content to enjoy the beguiling antics of Ms. Aniston, who is as skillful here as she is miscast, and to let its colorful minor characters give it a sitcom spin.\n",
        "There is a movie fighting to get out of The Object of My Affection, and I like it better than the movie it's trapped in.\n",
        "Paul Rudd is charming, and some of the scenes are intelligently written and played, but at a recent screening people on all sides of me were squirming in discomfort.\n",
        "While some of the solutions are a little facile, the film nevertheless succeeds, due in large part to a luminous performance by Jennifer Aniston...\n",
        "A delightful comedy-fantasy.\n",
        "Penny Marshall brings a logic to the premise that is sustained through most of the movie. And where the other movies snickered at the sexual possibilities in the idea, she faces up to them with both candor and taste.\n",
        "This setup isn't exactly what you'd call plausible, but the follow-through is consistent and clever.\n",
        "Big, which has been directed by Penny Marshall with verve and impeccable judgment, drops a child's innocence into the corporate rat race as if it were a depth charge.\n",
        "When Marshall brings Hanks and Perkins together, she discovers a grace and lightness in their relationship that transcends the pinched thematics of the script.\n",
        "Not a major movie but a pleasing one.\n",
        "As far as the movie's message is considered -- if only grown-ups could be more like kids -- Jerry Lewis did an infinitely better job of plugging it in the 50s.\n",
        "Unspools with enjoyable genuineness and ingenuity.\n",
        "Marshall, Hanks, and his co-stars seldom put a foot wrong.\n",
        "For any other full-grown actors who try their hands at fidgeting, squirming, throwing water balloons and wolfing down food in a huge variety of comically disgusting ways, this really is the performance to beat.\n",
        "What's great about it is that it shows how wonderfully full of toys the world of adults can be. And though this may fall under the heading of tiny, perhaps even fatuous, revelations, it does send you out of the theater with a lighter step.\n",
        "The film is funny, sweet, and even a little edgy. It's also emotionally honest and almost never crass.\n",
        "Sharp-eyed and charming.\n",
        "The pleasures in The Last Days of Disco come when the friends rant and quarrel and sulk and circle each other with an unstable mixture of need and resentment.\n",
        "[Stillman] nails his characters with perfectly heard dialogue and laconic satire.\n",
        "In its last hour, the picture becomes more clumsy and tiresome, but the stray laugh and the disco sound keep it pulsing.\n",
        "The combination of sharply-realized dialogue and infectiously energetic dance sequences keeps The Last Days of Disco from losing steam.\n",
        "If this film ... doesn't fully rise to the lovely vibrancy of Barcelona, it still extends the witty, quizzical style of Stillman's social comedies onto inviting new terrain.\n",
        "Lacking the moral indignation and militant politics of Lee's former work, this vibrantly colorful father-son melodrama is soft at the center, but it's one of the most accessible films Lee has made and Denzel Washington is terrific.\n",
        "At the end of Mr. Lee's movie, all you feel is the distraction of Mr. Lee's stylistic exhibitionism, without which, I concede, he might not be regarded as a genius in some quarters.\n",
        "[Lee] gets a charming performance from Allen, who, in his acting debut, occupies his pedestal with grace and diffidence.\n",
        "As usual, Lee tries many kinds of stylistic effects and uses wall-to-wall music (by Aaron Copland and Public Enemy); what's different this time is how personally driven the story feels.\n",
        "Most scenes play too long, with a surplus of ideas, textures, tones and characters, and after 134 minutes it's clear Lee's problem with closure hasn't gone away.\n",
        "Washington's Jake Shuttlesworth looks tough and hard, an odd but refreshing turn for an actor long associated with handsomely heroic roles.\n",
        "A two-hour air ball.\n",
        "Washington is so consistently effective an actor that it hardly needs be said that his excellent performance as the beleaguered Jake carries the film.\n",
        "The movie is a volatile combination of ambitious mythmaking and nasty reality, and like most of Spike Lee's work, it is also an inextricable combination of good and bad.\n",
        "an effective companion piece to Hoop Dreams and Blue Chips.\n",
        "Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen delivers nothing less than the best performance ever put on film by a pro athlete.\n",
        "The year's first Hollywood movie to burst with palpable feeling.\n",
        "Lee is a long way from the size and scope of his best film, Do the Right Thing, but at least he is working on a subject he cares about and is doing it with polish.\n",
        "He Got Game is Lee's best film since Malcolm X.\n",
        "Lee may never have the narrow focus to sustain a film on storytelling alone, and he may never need it. What he has here is an explosion of spectacular gambits and a great high-concept hook.\n",
        "The wildly uneven script includes both disciplined, lively riffs and amateurishly artificial exchanges.\n",
        "He Got Game is a little too sappy to be a great movie, but it puts the ball in the hole.\n",
        "Robert Altman the up-and- down director meets John Grisham the constant mediocrity. Just where, in our hypothetical picture, should we place that unlikely scene?\n",
        "Altman had a fine time composing difficult shots, through screens, bushes and sheets of rain, and Chungwei's images, sometimes delicate, sometimes harsh, stick with you long after you've forgotten their context.\n",
        "If you like movies more than you do John Grisham, you can leave the story behind and listen to the filmmaking master class that Altman conducts on the screen.\n",
        "There's great pleasure in watching a movie in which the director has thought out everything beforehand.\n",
        "The Gingerbread Man isn't any more profound than other thrillers, but the distinctive talents of director Robert Altman make it a lot more potent.\n",
        "Although The Gingerbread Man is a finely-tuned example of mainstream entertainment, and holds the audience's interest for most of its running length, it is a little disappointing.\n",
        "Unless one counts a few running gibes against lawyers that can easily be imagined coming from Grisham, Altman basically chooses to treat this hackneyed story straight.\n",
        "With unexpected success, Robert Altman plays a John Grisham mystery in a seductive new key.\n",
        "That it seems a step up from sensationalism is because Grisham has a sure sense of time and place, and Altman and his actors invest the material with a kind of lurid sincerity.\n",
        "The overall purpose of Live Flesh, the latest and reputedly most 'mature' work from Spanish bad-boy director Pedro Almodovar, remains engigmatic.\n",
        "Almodovar, whose work here has newly sophisticated polish, appreciates the dark twists of this story along with the eroticism that bring heat to all the scheming.\n",
        "Despite his erotic fixations, Pedro Almodovar is the cinema's last true innocent.\n",
        "I can only conclude that the people who think Flower and Live Flesh represent the new, mature Almodovar think that his earlier pictures were immature.\n",
        "This is the first Almodovar movie that could be called boring.\n",
        "Like the gorgeous cinematography (which is used to good effect to eroticize a sex scene), this is all part of Almodovar's stylistic package. Never has it been more impressive than here, where everything (not just the flesh) is vibrant with life.\n",
        "Almodovar seems more assured here, confident that he can interest us without overt winking and tomfoolery.\n",
        "There's an idiosyncratic talent at work here with the potential to blossom into bigger, better and more accomplished films.\n",
        "Kasdan's is a very promising debut, its own dearth of feeling offset by able writing, engaging playing and a sure sense of pace.\n",
        "It turns out to be disappointingly ordinary.\n",
        "Try as it might, \"Zero Effect\" just doesn't amount to much.\n",
        "This is one of those movies that creeps up on you, insidiously gathering power. By the end, I was surprised how much I was involved.\n",
        "Both Mr. Pullman and the slyly restrained Mr. Stiller keep their characters entertaining even when Mr. Kasdan's interest is elsewhere.\n",
        "Kasdan is onto something, but he needs to develop it. If he tries to bring Daryl Zero back for a sequel, maybe he'll have a better idea of what to do with his eccentric private eye.\n",
        "The level of humor could be called sophomoric, but that would insult most sophomores.\n",
        "A comedy without laughs, an expose without point.\n",
        "What turns the witlessness rancid is the way the movie is saturated in the very corruption it thinks it's ridiculing.\n",
        "A caustic but under-funny \"expose\" of the venality of the motion picture business.\n",
        "If you harbor an interest in watching so-called \"industry smarts\" autodestruct, this carries a certain morbid appeal, but that's about the extent of it.\n",
        "Burning is too good for such a wretched fiasco; only a surgical nuclear strike could suitably destroy what has to be one of the most enervating comedies ever made.\n",
        "The picture is just a spoof, getting by on wit and a parade of celebrity cameos. Within its modest scope, it pretty much succeeds.\n",
        "A spectacularly bad film -- incompetent, unfunny, ill-conceived, badly executed, lamely written, and acted by people who look trapped in the headlights.\n",
        "Incidentally, it's a bad idea to try bailing out hopelessly flat comedy with outtakes that are funnier than the in-takes manage to be.\n",
        "Our culture has notoriously short attention spans and memories, but Kurt and Courtney goes a long way toward undoing the meticulous public relations campaign that Love has orchestrated in an effort to whitewash her tarnished image.\n",
        "The true circumstances of Cobain's death remain cloudy, but one comes away from the film unnerved by the distance travelled.\n",
        "Kurt and Courtney is an entertaining swim through the muck of the rock underworld. But as journalism, it's an utterly sloppy piece of work.\n",
        "We do get a strong sense that Love is a loose cannon with a short fuse. But in a freewheeling documentary about a drug-addled rock-star couple that hardly qualifies as a news flash.\n",
        "It would be one mondo bizarro freak show but for the participation of some who clearly cared for the troubled young Cobain.\n",
        "We're left with only one credible impression of Courtney Love: That she is incredibly ambitious. What a shock!\n",
        "In the Kurt-and-Courtney relationship, Broomfield has gotten ahold of an engrossing subject. And he pretty much has what it takes to do it justice.\n",
        "You know little more about the subject when you leave the theater as when you came in.\n",
        "This patchwork portrait is hard to look away from, partly because it exposes how one man rationalizes the dirty job of being a documentary filmmaker.\n",
        "In the end, too, we've learned very little about Cobain's demons --- his alleged chronic stomach pains from stress, etc. --- or why he, and Nirvana, became so important to so many people\n",
        "[A] funny, angry, provocative film.\n",
        "Unreliable and categorically unfriendly to Love though it is, Kurt & Courtney is thoroughly watchable in a bad car accident, trash TV kind of way.\n",
        "When Kurt and Courtney veers into speculation and gives voice to bizarre and unreliable witnesses, it reeks of tabloid excess.\n",
        "In all of Broomfield's films, you meet people you can hardly believe exist.\n",
        "Mr. Broomfield doesn't ultimately prove, or even believe, that Mr. Cobain died under incriminating circumstances. But he makes it wrenchingly clear why the world in which he lived had become impossible to bear.\n",
        "Lurid and freakishly arresting.\n",
        "Has a visual style that seems rudimentary but becomes increasingly hypnotic and resonant.\n",
        "The film is such a lifeless drone that we experience it only as a movie.\n",
        "The talk flows persuasively; the picture pulses with art and humanity.\n",
        "Kiarostami is in no rush, but the respect and love he shows for his characters, and the confidence and simplicity of his technique, make Taste of Cherry a satisfying experience.\n",
        "Kiarastomi, like no other filmmaker, has a vision of human scale that is simultaneously epic and precisely minuscule.\n",
        "As the film's design becomes clear to us, a quiet spaciousness begins to inhabit it.\n",
        "This third outing in the Major League series... won't set any box office records [b]ut it's an amusing film in its own right...\n",
        "I can't easily remember a film I've enjoyed less.\n",
        "Kopple's discreet, quietly revelatory style creates a fine balance between public and private personae that veers more pointedly toward the personal in an incongruous but fascinating coda.\n",
        "It provides some generous insights into his psychic background when his unsupportive parents greet him back in New York at the end.\n",
        "It's hardly a revelation, but Allen emerges as genuinely neurotic. He's also funny.\n",
        "[Kopple's] made a greatly enjoyable film, but you can't help wondering if she's fallen under her subject's spell.\n",
        "[Kopple] might seem an unlikely choice for this material, but no doubt her track record gained Allen's trust.\n",
        "Wild Man Blues has a tendency to become repetitious, especially during the final forty minutes.\n",
        "In her unexpectedly delightful documentary about Woody Allen as jazz musician, Barbara Kopple demonstrates cinema verite at its most seductive.\n",
        "The Big Hit is nothing more, or less, than a big goof.\n",
        "...crude and bloody but effective action comedy...\n",
        "As low- intelligence entertainment goes, this film is very much a hit-and-miss affair.\n",
        "In its non-A-list way, The Big Hit is the most successful attempt yet to transfer the Hong Kong action movie to Hollywood.\n",
        "Score it big-time inane but a load of fun.\n",
        "The characters in these movies exist in a Twilight Zone where thousands of rounds of ammunition are fired, but no one ever gets shot unless the plot requires him to. The bullets have read the screenplay.\n",
        "Insatiable moviegoers are advised to wait till this action-comedy, written by Ben Ramsey, thuds into video stores; tasteful moviegoers will avoid it altogether.\n",
        "This silly adventure with Casper Van Dien as the latest Lord of the Apes comes across more like a sequel to George of the Jungle, but without the laughs.\n",
        "Tim McCanlies' charming feature directorial debut evokes the spirit of Capra's Depression comedies and Thornton Wilder's Our Town, without the nostalgia or sentimentality of those works.\n",
        "Boyle takes his wildly high-energy visual aesthetic and applies it to a story that, at its core, is rather sweet and traditionally crowdpleasing.\n",
        "It's Oliver Twist by way of City of God.\n",
        "The best movie of 2008.\n",
        "Slumdog Millionaire, a film so upbeat and colourful that, by the time you're relaying its infectious air of optimism to friends, you could forget that it features orphans, slaughter, organised crime, poverty, enslavement and police brutality.\n",
        "Slumdog Millionaire is not the cure for all the world's ills, but it comes close. It solves, for instance, such endemic global problems as: a) sadness, b) lovelessness, c) cynicism, and d) the waning cultural relevance of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.\n",
        "From an early footchase in which the careening camera gives us a tour of the maze-like slums, to the ridiculously uplifting Bollywood dance number that plays over the end credits, Slumdog Millionaire makes for kinetic, exhilarating entertainment.\n",
        "[A] taut, tense and witty tale of human tragedy and triumphant humanity set against the sweep of modern India.\n",
        "An intoxicating mix of genres: comedy, drama, suspense, even Bollywood-style musical.\n",
        "Watching Slumdog Millionaire, it's easy to believe director Danny Boyle has been working toward this brilliantly woven masterwork with each entertaining and diverse tale he's delivered.\n",
        "I'll keep this simple: Cancel whatever you're doing tonight and go see Slumdog Millionaire instead.\n",
        "Don't let the exotic setting put you off; this is a massively cool cross-cultural crowd-pleaser.\n",
        "It doesn't happen often, but when it does, look out: a movie that rocks and rolls, that transports, startles, delights, shocks, seduces. A movie that is, quite simply, great.\n",
        "The film is a delight.\n",
        "Not that the movie from director Danny Boyle isn't satisfying, isn't more than worth seeing. But I had been expecting cinematic fireworks to justify the claim that it's the best movie of the new millennium.\n",
        "Look for multiple Oscar nominations for this movie.\n",
        "Worth seeing.\n",
        "There are no surprises in this movie, and most people will be able to predict, within the first ten minutes, roughly how the last ten will pan out.\n",
        "Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire is trying very hard to be a Dickensian fable for our time.\n",
        "The movie brushes against some of India's worst social ills, but it's essentially a fairy tale.\n",
        "Slumdog Millionaire is skillful entertainment, with the simple message that the most intense life experiences yield the greatest education.\n",
        "There's a depth and caring to Still Breathing that you don't find in the usual major studio fare.\n",
        "A light and bright romantic comedy.\n",
        "The film's success ultimately rests on the couple -- and not once in this film, aside from a lot of wispy talk about fate and dreams, did I see any reason why these two opposites would be drawn to each other.\n",
        "This is a story that has been told many times before, but generally with more energy than this.\n",
        "A gooey, swooning swatch of romantic hyperventilation, its queasy charms. And let it be said that surrendering to those charms could be as guilt-inducing as polishing off a pint of Haagen-Dazs chocolate ice cream before lunch.\n",
        "It's a sharp, brave movie, a little ragged around the edges, but that's to its advantage.\n",
        "What gives Bulworth its unique character is that all this silliness is periodically punctuated by cogent, carefully thought-out mini-manifestos...\n",
        "Bulworth works, with both urbanity and chutzpah, by viewing political puppeteering with an all-purpose jaundiced eye.\n",
        "As writer, director and star, Beatty flails all over the screen, but he's also made the only recent political satire that draws blood.\n",
        "A shrewd political observer for decades, Beatty has fashioned a hilarious morality tale that delivers a surprisingly potent, angry message beneath the laughs.\n",
        "Bulworth is an angry movie, but Beatty is savvy enough to recognize that people respond better to comedies than serious \"issue films,\" so he has camouflaged his message beneath the surface of this original, incisive satire.\n",
        "Bulworth plays like a cry of frustrated comic rage. It's about an archetypal character who increasingly seems to stand for our national mood: the guy who's fed up and isn't going to take it anymore.\n",
        "It's certainly distinctive, looking at times like Richard Lester put through a postmodernist blender.\n",
        "(Gilliam's) vision is too reflexively comic to evoke the shadows of dread in Thompson's writing.\n",
        "Pic serves up a sensory overload without any compensatory reflection on the outlandish and irresponsible behavior on view.\n",
        "A film of brilliant moments, but sadly less coherent - and, on senses, rather less personal - than most of Gilliam's work.\n",
        "It's really a series of sketches on one theme.\n",
        "If you encountered characters like this on an elevator, you'd push a button and get off at the next floor. Here the elevator is trapped between floors for 128 minutes.\n",
        "Darn funny, but those moments of seemingly-inspired humor are more than offset by the rest of the movie, which is nearly unwatchable.\n",
        "Slipshod storytelling, junior high-level acting and direction that resembles Aunt Gertrude's home movies.\n",
        "A waste of time.\n",
        "The film represents a triumph of atmosphere over a none-too-mysterious mystery. Which is to say that Nolan makes you feel the end-of-the-earth bleakness of his setting, makes you feel the way it can discombobulate people once they internalize it.\n",
        "With a run-of-the-mill bad-guy actor playing chief suspect Walter Finch, the movie might have tipped too far Pacino's way. But Robin Williams is a shockingly effective counterweight.\n",
        "Scene by scene, screenwriter Hillary Seitz follows director Erik Skjoldbjaerg's original closely, but this remake deepens and improves upon the Norwegian film by giving Dormer a more complex relationship with Eckhart.\n",
        "Nolan uses visual pyrotechnics to pump up the tension and add to Pacino's sense of disorientation, but the feeling he evokes isn't as forlorn, creepy, or ambiguous as in the original (though the mountain wilderness is just as forbidding).\n",
        "This one is nowhere near as original -- it's a flawed remake of a fine first feature from Norway -- but Insomnia still stands on its own as a thriller with brains and scenic beauty.\n",
        "A dark and fidgety picture from Christopher Nolan, who made such a splash with Memento.\n",
        "The highlight is Pacino, who gives his best performance in years.\n",
        "Despite its linear storyline, the film is very recognisably the work of the sharp, probing intelligence that gave us Following and Memento.\n",
        "While it may not be as stylistically idiosyncratic as Memento Insomnia is a gripping, highly dramatic thriller that more than confirms the distinctive talent of young Brit helmer Christopher Nolan.\n",
        "It's a crafty story told with more style and gray areas than your average thriller.\n",
        "Insomnia is not my kind of arsenic, but it's so well-made and enigmatic I liked it anyway.\n",
        "The Hollywood version (which is half an hour longer) transports the action to Alaska, and works up a respectable level of bleary-eyed paranoia.\n",
        "The best thing about Insomnia is that despite director Christopher Nolan's soft spot for moody-blues obfuscation, he has the good sense to keep his star in practically every shot.\n",
        "A thriller whose style, structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story, you cannot separate them.\n",
        "You see Robin Williams and psycho killer, and you think, hmmmmm. You see the movie and you think, zzzzzzzzz.\n",
        "This remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise: Al Pacino loathing Robin Williams.\n",
        "Continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence, of good guys and bad, and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means.\n",
        "Pacino, his creased face looking like it's been aged in a smokehouse, is wonderfully bleary as the increasingly confused Dormer.\n",
        "A haunting psychological drama.\n",
        "Here's proof that it's still possible to make pop-oriented yet personal movies with an A-list cast and a zillion bucks.\n",
        "Kaplan and Elfont provide a real public service by showing how underage binge drinking can boost bookish students' social lives.\n",
        "Fortunately, some of the appealing young performers -- who include Ethan Embry, Charlie Korsmo, Lauren Ambrose and, especially, Seth Green -- manage to emerge from the film's generic suburban-teen backdrop.\n",
        "There are signs that Can't Hardly Wait once had more serious aspirations... But in the final edit, at least, it's the dumb, broad slapstick that prevails, short-circuiting identification with the characters before it can begin.\n",
        "The majority of the film is mired in magazine cliches and tired gags. Oh, look, the foreign exchange student only knows how to say he's a sex machine, haw! And the nerd's getting drunk! Hoo!\n",
        "A high-spirited, synthetically raucous house-party comedy.\n",
        "It's not supposed to be a revelation--just a pleasant rendition of a teen-comedy trope.\n",
        "John Hughes must be spinning in his grave.\n",
        "A failed attempt to recapture the exuberant magic of such highschool movie classics as American Graffiti, this is a loud and boisterous comedy, in which the entire action is set during an interminably long graduation night.\n",
        "Manages to serve up new rock, eighties dance music, rap and Barry Manilow -- a combination custom-made to annoy audiences of all ages.\n",
        "For all its nonstop energy and high spirits, Can't Hardly Wait allows its characters to emerge as fully dimensional individuals; they've been written with care and perception and played with equal aplomb by a roster of talented young actors.\n",
        "The directors get good performances from a talented cast.\n",
        "The title seems unexpectedly appropriate, as it accurately summed up my feelings about sitting in the theater and anticipating the arrival of the end credits -- I couldn't hardly wait.\n",
        "Flip through any yearbook, and you'll find the stock characters who amusingly populate the teen-age comedy Can't Hardly Wait.\n",
        "The movie lumbers ungracefully from romantic showdowns to Deep Conversations to bathroom humor.\n",
        "A highlight of the 1998 Sundance Festival: Cholodenko depicts with unwavering veracity the breakup of one longtime lesbian relationship just as another, unexpected one begins. The acting of the three women, Sheedy Mitchell, and Clarkson, is superb.\n",
        "Made in the British tradition of quality, the film adds another panel to the revisionist history of women's roles in WWII--Women's Land Army (WLA), a unit composed of women who replaced men in the fields--Rachel Weisz is a major talent to watch.\n",
        "Part an adventurous love story between a man and a leopard, part a metaphysical meditation about the mysteries of Nature, Lavinia Currier's feature directorial debut is dramatically inert but visually striking.\n",
        "What [director] Kirkman succeeds in doing is proving that [Jesse] Helms and his bigotry should not personify North Carolina.\n",
        "Dream for an Insomniac is really a self-conscious modern sitcom that with its San Francisco setting suggests a pale shadow of Armistead Maupin's Tales From the City.\n",
        "It's talky, clumsy and a bit trivial, but the talk is rarely dull, and there's an integrity about its clumsiness: It's harder to be smooth when you have things you really want to say.\n",
        "This all-black screwball comedy, about the fables and foibles of black middle-class urbanites, is well constructed, but it lacks style and polish to make it really work\n",
        "Overall, this is a lovely film, ranking with the best of Disney's animated features while taking on rather serious issues of war, honor, gender roles and family pride.\n",
        "What's terrific about Mulan is its reaching for emotions that other movies run from: family love and duty, personal honor and group commitment, obedience and ingenuity.\n",
        "Goes about halfway toward setting new boundaries for Disney's, and the industry's, animated features, but doesn't go far enough.\n",
        "Using richly hued, angular animation, this vibrant, action-filled Disney offering is immensely entertaining.\n",
        "A disappointment for anyone hoping the studio would raise the standard of the animated feature to a new level.\n",
        "The film shines at capturing the watercolor delicacy of China's past.\n",
        "Memo to the gang at Walt Disney animation: Your formula is showing.\n",
        "The incredible special effects, which make lush cherry blossoms as vivid as the intense battle scenes, are balanced by Disney's tradition of care and painstaking detail in developing and animating its characters.\n",
        "Everyone will be entertained the fast-moving plot and rich animation.\n",
        "A film that adults can enjoy on their own, without feeling an obligation to take along kids as a cover.\n",
        "The most self-assured and by all indications the most successful Disney 'toon in years...\n",
        "Mulan is Disney's first journey to China for an animated feature, and it's a spectacular trip.\n",
        "This is the most inert and formulaic of recent Disney animated films, right down to the clowning sidekicks and would-be ''Under the Sea'' production number.\n",
        "Mulan is artful and satisfying in a slightly remote way.\n",
        "The X-Files movie is really just a two-hour teaser for the series's sixth season. And little else.\n",
        "Dark, funny, paranoid, arbitrary, humming with tamped-down eroticism and in love with all things weird: That's the good news.\n",
        "Stylish, scary, sardonically funny and at times just plain gross.\n",
        "As it is, pic serves up set-pieces and a measure of scope that are beyond TV size but remain rather underwhelming by feature standards.\n",
        "Only two scenes in this spin-off are worth the time of followers of the TV series.\n",
        "The director, Rob Bowman, is not some TV hack; his work is thrillingly kinetic.\n",
        "The truth may be out there, but it's certainly not in here.\n",
        "Had the creator of The X-Files set out to prove that tiny theorem, he couldn't have done a better job.\n",
        "David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are enormously sympathetic heroes.\n",
        "Who hasn't walked into a movie late and tried desperately to catch up with the plot, to make sense of what's on the screen?\n",
        "It's a two-hour episode of the show, except with better production values and a nicer wardrobe for Scully.\n",
        "One of the season's more lightly enjoyable mainstream offerings.\n",
        "Conspiracy theorists, consider this: What if the hush-hush atmosphere and Internet mania surrounding the first X-Files feature film were part of a giant plot to hide the uneventfulness of one more summertime sci-fi fizzle?\n",
        "As pure movie, The X-Files more or less works. As a story, it needs a sequel, a prequel, and Cliff Notes.\n",
        "Slim on story and rife with scatological jokes, the film may strike a chord with pre-teens but misses for an older crowd despite some nifty effects and broad humor.\n",
        "Murphy's likeable, the script's laden with a gaggle of one-liners, and there's even a vague message nestling beneath the zoological chaos.\n",
        "The movie will not harm anyone, and in the audience I saw it with, lots of parents and kids seemed to be laughing together.\n",
        "The old actor's rule -- never work with animals or kids -- has never seemed more apt. The animals steal the scene from Murphy every time, and he gives it up gladly.\n",
        "Dr. Dolittle runs out of ideas long before the projector runs out of film.\n",
        "A cloying, humorless motion picture whose only assets are the work of Jim Henson's Creature Shop and a couple of good one-liners by a pair of rodents.\n",
        "Soderbergh understands the flaky, funny spirit of Leonard's characters and he gets his cast to express it.\n",
        "Out of Sight is slick in all the right ways.\n",
        "Clooney is the most impressive he's been on film. Jack Foley feels real, not like some Hollywood improvisation. Foley is charming, handsome, graceful, cultured, energetic and disciplined. He just can't stop committing crimes.\n",
        "The characters all seem to have known each other for years, referring to long-held grudges and resentments that only gradually are revealed to the audience. They're a seedy, petty, dangerous and delightful bunch.\n",
        "After many mishaps, the art of bringing Elmore Leonard's novels to the screen is coming to fruition. This latest adaptation, by director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Frank, gets it just about right.\n",
        "[A] now-classic romantic comedy -- with plenty of action and suspense.\n",
        "There isn't a character in the large, excellent cast that doesn't emerge with depth and precision.\n",
        "A darkly amusing and sly romantic comedy about an accident-prone bank robber (George Clooney) who falls in love with the sexy federal marshal (Jennifer Lopez) on his tail.\n",
        "Easily the best film I've seen in 1998.\n",
        "Out of Sight may be the first movie that has truly gotten an Elmore Leonard novel on screen, in all its hangdog wit and fractured-jigsaw form.\n",
        "Out Of Sight is another fine mess Elmore Leonard has got us into.\n",
        "Steven Soderbergh's most ambitious and most accomplished work to date.\n",
        "From the first shot to the last, Mr. Clooney is in complete command of the screen in the assured manner of the biggest stars in the past, and he doesn't need a ton of special effects and digital enhancement to generate excitement.\n",
        "A splendid reminder of just how assured, intelligent and involving Soderbergh's movies can be.\n",
        "Out of Sight may go down in the annals of film as the movie in which George Clooney learned to keep his head still -- and became a leading man.\n",
        "Out of Sight isn't just a rousing piece of entertainment, it's also a cinematic salvage operation.\n",
        "As always with the best of Leonard, it's the journey, not the destination, that counts, and director Soderbergh has let it unfold with dry wit and great skill.\n",
        "Steven Soderbergh's best film since Sex, Lies and Videotape a decade ago.\n",
        "Some reviewers have applauded Out of Sight for its nuances of character, but I and others don't see any characters at all.\n",
        "Spottily effective.\n",
        "This horrific tale is told with marvelous shadowy indirection and delicate lyricism.\n",
        "The result is little more than a discreetly artistic horror film.\n",
        "The story provides Mr. Weir with material for a kind of Australian horror-romance that recalls Nathaniel Hawthorne's preoccupation with the spiritual and moral heritage of his own New England landscape.\n",
        "A film of haunting mystery and buried sexual hysteria.\n",
        "One of the most hauntingly beautiful mysteries ever created on film.\n",
        "Bruce Willis saves the world but can't save \"Armageddon.\"\n",
        "This idiotic film is loud, boorish and smart enough to relish its own lunkhead bravado...\n",
        "Bay loves to place the camera in the path of meteors or pieces of spaceships or airborne cars. Did one of these projectiles conk him on his noggin? Is that why \"Armageddon\" is so utterly and thoroughly incompetent?\n",
        "I hate Armageddon for what it is: the unholy spawn of The Dirty Dozen and Con Air.\n",
        "Sporadically watchable, it's at its best at those infrequent moments when it doesn't take itself too seriously.\n",
        "...the latest in a line of increasingly-stupid action pictures that amazes audiences with flashy special effects and nifty action sequences, but leaves them high and dry in both the character and story departments.\n",
        "It delivers the thrill-ride twists and turns, exciting but not surprising.\n",
        "Along with the rest of the audience, I jumped when I was meant to jump, laughed when I was meant to laugh, and swallowed a lump in my throat when I was meant to feel moved.\n",
        "Save the planet, but spare us this movie.\n",
        "A real movie about courage in space is Apollo 13, in which fear and sacrifice have meaning. This jingoistic, overblown spectacle is about whistling in the dark.\n",
        "It sure makes an ugly mess.\n",
        "...doesn't give a hoot about making a deep, humanistic impact on us.\n",
        "...full of sound and fury but without a single new idea to add to the conversation.\n",
        "...why couldn't the film have tapped into a more noble and stylish tradition? Why couldn't these men have been interesting instead of cartoons?\n",
        "The only compelling lure is the special effects, which are sometimes impressive, sometimes transparent, yet somehow always inadequate to the apocalyptic task at hand.\n",
        "The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense and the human desire to be entertained.\n",
        "There are many things to dislike about Armageddon, from its stunningly straight-faced Charlton Heston introduction to its casual contempt for the Greenpeace activists protesting the drilling of oil wells\n",
        "The movie opens with the destruction of Manhattan by meteor shower, and, midway through, Paris gets wiped out as well. Naturally, no one blinks an eye.\n",
        "Aronofsky, who has parlayed this movie's Sundance success into two Hollywood deals, is that rare indie filmmaker who doesn't want to make hip romantic sitcoms. He's a genuine experimenter with a spooky visual style.\n",
        "We share Max's feelings of imminent psychological disintegration as the film probes our own insecurity in the face of the eternal. Maths meets millennial doom in one of the decade's true originals.\n",
        "It's remarkable to what extent Aronofsky has rendered the cerebral kinetically intense. The film's imaginative, diverse images create a mind's-eye urban claustrophobia.\n",
        "Audacious and bursting with ideas.\n",
        "The movie's low-budget look neatly matches the claustrophobia of Max's life, but the filmmakers have also devised some special shooting methods for certain scenes. These sequences -- breathless and jangly chases, for the most part -- look terrific.\n",
        "As smart as it is, 'Pi' is awfully hard to watch. Filmed with hand-held cameras in splotchy black-and-white and crudely edited, it has the style and attitude of a no-budget midnight movie.\n",
        "Transports us to a world that is like yet unlike our own, and, in its mysterious familiarity, is eerie, intense, and compelling.\n",
        "It all leads to a very strange place, and I'm particularly impressed with the economical means, both financially and artistically, by which Aronofsky gets there.\n",
        "The seductive thing about Aronofsky's film is that it is halfway plausible in terms of modern physics and math.\n",
        "Pi turns what should be a metaphoric relationship into a stupefyingly literal-minded thriller.\n",
        "Aldrich's direction and dynamite performances from the two old troupers make this film an experience.\n",
        "The chain of circumstances grows, violence creating violence. Once the inept, draggy start is passed, the film's pace builds with ever-growing force.\n",
        "The Grand Guignol elements themselves are relatively forced and unconvincing.\n",
        "There is nothing particularly moving or significant about these two.\n",
        "J. Hoberman of the Village Voice has made a case for Wood as an unconscious avant-gardist; there's no denying that his blunders are unusually creative and oddly expressive.\n",
        "It all ends with famous psychic Criswell asking the audience, 'Can you prove it didn't happen? God help us in the future'. Prophetic.\n",
        "Although the audible devices worked exceedingly well in most instances, it is questionable whether it would not have been wiser to leave some of the voices to the imagination.\n",
        "A tedious musical comedy embedded in a routine story like a fly in celluloid.\n",
        "Excellent bits of sound workmanship are that of camera and mike following Page and the heavy along the dance floor to pick up their conversation as they glide.\n",
        "The staging is wooden, the story insipid, and the dialogue sequences mostly painful, but the film's integration of song, dance, and story was a clear narrative advance over the music pictures being released by Warner Brothers and Fox.\n",
        "The Broadway Melody has not stood the test of time in ways that many of its more artistic contemporaries have.\n",
        "The despair-and the artistry-is breathtaking.\n",
        "From such grisly materials the popular cinema is rarely drawn. The film is monumental in the courage that risked its manufacture.\n",
        "A harrowing, gruesome, morbid tale of war.\n",
        "Deserves its reputation as a classic.\n",
        "The film's strength now derives less from its admittedly powerful but highly simplistic utterances about war as waste, than from a generally excellent set of performances (Ayres especially) and an almost total reluctance to follow normal plot structure.\n",
        "Messrs. Milestone, Abbott and Anderson in this film have contributed a memorable piece of work to the screen.\n",
        "All Quiet on the Western Front is the definitive World War I motion picture, the best of a surprisingly small class of movies.\n",
        "There's nothing thrilling or new about the work here, but accomplished it is.\n",
        "Spirit is smarter than your average cartoon because it doesn't try to joke around with a host of annoying talking animals.\n",
        "There's not much of a story, the whole thing's a bit superficial, and there's little to laugh at, but it's still a refreshing change from the norm.\n",
        "An exciting and exquisitely rendered film in which the horse goes through as many adventures and perils as Indiana Jones on a good day.\n",
        "A welcome family film that extols noble values and offers first-class animation.\n",
        "Rather exciting, rendered in a bright sunset palette and a mixture of expressive, boldly drawn traditional animation and fluid computer-generated imagery.\n",
        "As animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool, this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth.\n",
        "The movie's big action scenes ... make you forget you're even watching animation.\n",
        "A ripping yarn with memorable characters.\n",
        "A movie that will touch the hearts of both children and adults, as well as bring audiences to the edge of their seats.\n",
        "It is perhaps Spirit's greatest achievement that the horses upstage the human actors, but it's also its greatest weakness. The human characters have no depth or personality, but are rather completely forgettable, stiff stereotypes.\n",
        "Adams' hoarse anthems become a betrayal of this horse opera's true potential; fortunately, there is enough fine achievement here to make the film worth seeing.\n",
        "A mishmash that is sometimes moving, sometimes absurd and most of the time just oddly off balance.\n",
        "A cartoon that's truly cinematic in scope, and a story that's compelling and heartfelt -- even if the heart belongs to a big, four-legged herbivore.\n",
        "Not quite as miraculous as its DreamWorks makers would have you believe, but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions.\n",
        "A beautifully rendered but unimaginatively plotted cartoon about settlers, Native Americans and the horses caught in between.\n",
        "A strange, often intriguing animated film for children and young adults that takes a lot of chances and only occasionally stumbles.\n",
        "Spirit combines the hand-drawn artfulness of 2-D with computer-generated 3-D backdrops and effects so seamlessly that it's hard to tell what was done by man, what by mouse.\n",
        "Uncluttered by comic supporting characters and cute sidekicks, Spirit is more pure and direct than most of the stories we see in animation -- a fable I suspect younger viewers will strongly identify with.\n",
        "As it is, the hotel is well filled.\n",
        "A commercial picture of high box office potential, first by assembling the most impressive aggregation so far of strictly Bradstreet screen names, and then by filming the play practically unaltered in form.\n",
        "Less effective as a movie than as a dazzling parade of star iconography.\n",
        "The Nashville of its day, Grand Hotel's reputation has outgrown its actual quality\n",
        "It is a production thoroughly worthy of all the talk it has created and the several motion-picture luminaries deserve to feel very proud of their performances, particularly Greta Garbo and Lionel Barrymore.\n",
        "It hasn't aged as well as some Oscar-winners, but neither is it as dated as, for example, Cimarron.\n",
        "It's rife with fey, unintentional camp like the scene in which a newlywed couple pledge eternal love on the deck of an ocean liner -- only to move away and reveal a life preserver labeled Titanic.\n",
        "Almost certain to be near the top of the list for 1933.\n",
        "This is the first big film out of the Fox studio since Sheehan's return there and this is a big picture from and on every angle.\n",
        "Nary a tear-jerking trick is missed (our family loses one son to the Titanic, the other to World War I), and the strangulation is compounded by the staginess since the film.\n",
        "It is a most affecting and impressive picture.\n",
        "If nothing else, this reveals something about the lingering power of World War I on the national and international psyches during the era.\n",
        "Despite the efforts of Producer Irving Thalberg, Director Frank Lloyd, three scenarists and $2,000,000 to give it balance, polish and direction, the picture lacks all three.\n",
        "There's nothing to stand in the way of Mutiny qualifying for box office dynamite rating.\n",
        "The story is spellbinding, the acting lusty and the spectacle everything you could expect from a Golden Age MGM production -- though sometimes it's a bit too much on the monumental side.\n",
        "It's tainted by a fair amount of middlebrow stuffiness, but it's a fleet piece of storytelling and serves to enshrine one of the great ham performances of all time, Charles Laughton's Captain Bligh.\n",
        "An exotic and gripping piece of Hollywood mythology, made with all the technical skill and gloss one associates with Irving Thalberg's MGM.\n",
        "It is superlatively thrilling.\n",
        "A rousing adventure film set on the high seas.\n",
        "Pretentious, packed with hokum and as richly sentimental as an Irving Berlin lyric, it is, as such, top-notch entertainment.\n",
        "Considering the recent screen standards in book musicals with five numbers for 100 to 110 minutes of running time this Metro Santaclausing of numbers becomes virtually a double-feature filmusical.\n",
        "If the picture overcrowds its screen, at least we must admit it is an impressive kaleidoscope; and probably nothing short of that could reflect the gaudy career of America's foremost showman.\n",
        "It's amazingly dull, even with William Powell in the lead and guest appearances by the likes of Ray Bolger and Fanny Brice, so of course it won the Best Picture Oscar for 1936.\n",
        "Although some of the production's technical aspects remain impressive, the dramatic elements come across as trite and many of the musical numbers are dated.\n",
        "Last week Warner Brothers released a movie which is probably the outstanding prestige picture of the season. It is also one of the best shows.\n",
        "The film is destined to box office approval of the most substantial character. It is finely made and merits high rating as cinema art and significant recognition as major showmanship.\n",
        "This act of altruism on behalf of the brothers Warner was rewarded with the best picture Oscar for 1937; it isn't so much bad as utterly, magisterially bland.\n",
        "Carefully mounted, well directed and acted, but basically the sort of well-meaning pap out of which Oscars are made.\n",
        "A great and valuable and stirring film document.\n",
        "It's a compelling film that demands no previous knowledge of the title character in order to derive satisfaction from the story.\n",
        "It's a grand picture.\n",
        "Easily the No. 1 cinema comedy of 1938.\n",
        "The tempo is generally fast and there are no sudden spurts or sharp letdowns.\n",
        "The cast is appealing, particularly Stewart and Arthur, but it's not enough.\n",
        "There are still some laughs and entertainment to be found here, but forget about fidelity to the original.\n",
        "You Can't Take it with You was a tonic to a Depression-weary country beginning to right itself economically.\n",
        "The acting is strong, and Arthur Miller's Oscar-winning photography gives the images a spooky luster, but a little bit of Ford's salt-of-the-earth piety goes an awfully long way.\n",
        "Because his recollections ring true, they are certain to evoke a similar nostalgia in all but the most slab-sided of moviegoers.\n",
        "How Green Was My Valley is one of the year's better films, a sure-fire critic's picture and, unlike most features that draw kudos from crix, this one will also do business.\n",
        "Expert performances from Donald Crisp, Walter Pidgeon, Maureen O'Hara, and a host of brilliant character actors enhance a magnificent movie experience.\n",
        "An elegant and eloquent film, nevertheless, even if the characteristically laconic Fordian poetry seems more contrived here.\n",
        "You can never expect to see a film more handsomely played.\n",
        "If not for the inevitable comparisons to Citizen Kane, How Green Was My Valley might have aged better.\n",
        "That almost impossible feat, a great war picture that photographs the inner meaning, instead of the outward realism of World War II.\n",
        "A poignant story of the joys and sorrows, the humor and pathos of middle-class family life in wartime England.\n",
        "The most famous and perhaps most effective propaganda film of World War II.\n",
        "Classic soap opera in which good old British understatement has a field day, everybody is frightfully nice, and sentimentality is wrapped up in yards of tasteful gloss.\n",
        "Certainly it is the finest film yet made about the present war, and a most exalting tribute to the British, who have taken it gallantly.\n",
        "It's one of a few highly regarded contemporaneous motion pictures to deal frankly with the domestic aspects of World War II.\n",
        "There's nothing special or memorable about this overlong endeavor, the first of two motion pictures to feature Bing Crosby's insufferably noble Father Chuck O'Malley.\n",
        "It offers, in the performance of nutcracker-faced, 56-year-old Barry Fitzgerald, the finest, funniest and most touching portrayal of old age that has yet reached the screen.\n",
        "Major thread of gaiety runs through the proceedings, and McCarey has liberally sprinkled sparkling individual episodes along the way for cinch audience reaction.\n",
        "Go anywhere to avoid it.\n",
        "Rich, warm and human to the core.\n",
        "Director Billy Wilder's technique of photographing Third Avenue in the grey morning sunlight with a concealed camera to keep the crowds from being self-conscious gives this sequence the shock of reality.\n",
        "It is intense, morbid -- and thrilling. Here is an intelligent dissection of one of society's most rampant evils.\n",
        "Today it's less impressive but not without its virtues.\n",
        "What makes the film so gripping is the brilliance with which Wilder uses John F Seitz's camerawork to range from an unvarnished portrait of New York brutally stripped of all glamour.\n",
        "A shatteringly realistic and morbidly fascinating film.\n",
        "Like most good mass entertainments, this picture has occasional moments of knowing hokum; but unlike most sure-fire movies, it was put together with good taste, honesty, wit -- and even a strong suggestion of guts.\n",
        "Although it contains moving passages, Best Years is not much more than a conventional drama on the problems of servicemen attempting to adjust to life in postwar America, well served by an all-star cast and Toland's ingenious deep-focus setups.\n",
        "One of the best pictures of our lives.\n",
        "Surprisingly modern: lean, direct, honest about issues that Hollywood then studiously avoided.\n",
        "I'd call this the best American movie about returning soldiers I've ever seen -- the most moving and the most deeply felt.\n",
        "The film is very proud of itself, exuding a stifling piety at times, but it works as well as this sort of thing can, thanks to accomplished performances by Fredric March, Myrna Loy, and Dana Andrews, who keep the human element afloat.\n",
        "Overlong, perhaps, but this tender and occasionally tough look at the plight of returning war veterans is one of Wyler's best films.\n",
        "It is seldom that there comes a motion picture which can be wholly and enthusiastically endorsed not only as superlative entertainment but as food for quiet and humanizing thought.\n",
        "The feeling of warmth and satisfaction that accompanies the conclusion is the hallmark of a great drama.\n",
        "Agreement was tame, cautious stuff even back then.\n",
        "By dispassionate critical standards, Gentleman's Agreement is not a success. It is a tract rather than a play and it has the crusader's shortcomings.\n",
        "The movie is as powerful today as when it captured the Best Picture Oscar a few years after Hitler's genocide ended in Europe.\n",
        "Gentleman's Agreement is an important experiment, honestly approached and successfully brought off.\n",
        "It looks pretty timorous now.\n",
        "[A] brilliant and powerful film.\n",
        "Good performances, however, particularly from Garfield and Holm.\n",
        "The film still has abundant meaning and should be fully and widely enjoyed.\n",
        "The movie's plot does not quite hold all this pageantry together, but De Mille's scripters and actors enter into the thing in the proper flamboyant spirit.\n",
        "This is the circus with more entertainment, more thrills, more spangles and as much Big Top atmosphere as RB-B&B itself can offer. It's a smash certainty for high-wire grosses.\n",
        "It won best-picture Oscar for 1952, but God (De Mille's favorite walk-on, strangely absent here) only knows why.\n",
        "Characteristically elephantine Big Top epic from DeMille, thumped across with a winning brashness and garnering the veteran showman his first Best Picture Oscar.\n",
        "Two American institutions have combined to put out a piece of entertainment that will delight movie audiences for years.\n",
        "In From Here to Eternity, you can glimpse an uneasier future for America, with the social wreckage and the pretending.\n",
        "Scriptwriter Daniel Taradash rescued, if not quite a gem, then at least a high-grade industrial diamond from this rough original.\n",
        "It is an important film from any angle, presenting socko entertainment for big business.\n",
        "Sominex is cheaper and probably safer.\n",
        "Zinnemann's flat direction does produce its dull moments.\n",
        "So clear-eyed and three-dimensional that it makes the recent Pearl Harbor look like a bunch of kids playing dress up.\n",
        "Rapturously received from the moment it was released in 1953, From Here to Eternity remains, half a century later, a singular cinematic experience, one of the landmarks of American film.\n",
        "Contemporary audiences may not see why, even in its toned-down simplification of the novel, From Here to Eternity was the most daring movie of 1953, but it remains an acting bonanza.\n",
        "Out of From Here to Eternity, a novel whose anger and compassion stirred a postwar reading public as few such works have, Columbia and a company of sensitive hands have forged a film almost as towering and persuasive as its source.\n",
        "On the Waterfront has a script that is a work of love and shows it.\n",
        "Under Elia Kazan's direction, Marlon Brando puts on a spectacular show, giving a fascinating, multi-faceted performance as the uneducated dock walloper and former pug, who is basically a softie with a special affection for his rooftop covey of pigeons.\n",
        "It's hard to deny that Marlon Brando's performance as a dock worker and ex-fighter who finally decides to rat on his gangster brother (Rod Steiger) is pretty terrific.\n",
        "It's pretty electrifying.\n",
        "You miss this, you're buyin' a one-way ticket to Palookaville.\n",
        "Indisputably one of the great American films, its power undiminished.\n",
        "So when does it hit you that you're in the presence of movie greatness?\n",
        "It is thanks to Brando that this posthumous Popular Front classic is a heart-clutcher from beginning to end.\n",
        "An uncommonly powerful, exciting and imaginative use of the screen by gifted professionals.\n",
        "One of the best acted efforts to come out of Hollywood during the 1950s.\n",
        "It is still possible to feel the power of the film and of Brando and Kazan, who changed American movie acting forever.\n",
        "West Side Story is a beautifully-mounted, impressive, emotion-ridden and violent musical which, in its stark approach to a raging social problem and realism of unfoldment, may set a pattern for future musical presentations.\n",
        "Unhappily, the film shares a serious flaw in the essential conception of the show; both are founded on a phony literary analogy and on some potentially vicious pseudo-sociology.\n",
        "Decent 1961 adaptation of the Bernstein-Robbins musical, if you can handle Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood in the leads.\n",
        "How does the film -- which won ten Oscars on its 1961 release -- stand up now? Very well indeed.\n",
        "It is a great movie ... in parts.\n",
        "The marvel is that the film still works so well.\n",
        "What they have done with West Side Story in knocking it down and moving it from stage to screen is to reconstruct its fine material into nothing short of a cinema masterpiece.\n",
        "It still represents a brave and effective fusion of serious and fantasy elements, and offers two and one-half hours of solid entertainment.\n",
        "While Tom remains a lot of fun, he's just not the irreverent Young Turk he seemed three decades ago.\n",
        "It's a free-wheeling, fast-moving relic from a time when \"bawdy\" wasn't bad and sex comedies still celebrated sex.\n",
        "The film is a way-out, walleyed, wonderful exercise in cinema. It is also a social satire written in blood with a broadaxe. It is bawdy as the British were bawdy when a wench had to wear five petticoats to barricade her virtue.\n",
        "It has sex, Eastmancolor, some prime performers and plenty of action.\n",
        "Despite the fitful energy and the beauty of the settings, the ugliness of the mise en scene and the crudity of the editing tend to triumph.\n",
        "Osborne's courageous hatchet job on Fielding's 1,000 page classic novel and Finney's gutsy performance add up to produce an enjoyable piece of irreverent entertainment.\n",
        "Prepare yourself for what is surely one of the wildest, bawdiest and funniest comedies that a refreshingly agile filmmaker has ever brought to the screen.\n",
        "There's more than a little of the school pageant in the rhythm of the movie: Though it's all neater than our school drama coaches could make it, the figures group and say their assigned lines and move on.\n",
        "One of the most intelligent religious movies ever made.\n",
        "Producer-director Fred Zinnemann has blended all filmmaking elements into an excellent, handsome and stirring film version of A Man For All Seasons.\n",
        "Robert Bolt's boring historical drama functions best as an anthology of British acting styles, circa 1966.\n",
        "Orson Welles alone relieves the boredom in a marvellous cameo as Cardinal Wolsey. If only they'd let him loose with the whole sorry history...\n",
        "A Man for All Seasons is a picture that inspires admiration, courage and thought.\n",
        "Social importance aside, In the Heat of the Night works as a buddy film and as a tense thriller.\n",
        "No deep solutions are suggested in this subtle and meticulously observed study. Yet Director Norman Jewison has used his camera to extract a cer tain rough-cut beauty from each protagonist.\n",
        "An excellent Sidney Poitier performance, and an outstanding one by Rod Steiger, overcome some noteworthy flaws to make In The Heat of the Night an absorbing contemporary murder drama.\n",
        "A decent piece of do-good cinema.\n",
        "Oozes sufficient Southern sweat and features enough admirably crumpled character faces to make up for its over-strident liberal rhetoric.\n",
        "A film that has the look and sound of actuality and the pounding pulse of truth.\n",
        "The focus of the movie is so wide, and the logistics of the production so heavy, that Oliver himself, dutifully played by 9-year-old Mark Lester, gets flattened out and almost lost, as if he had been run over by a studio bulldozer.\n",
        "There's plenty of mileage left in the famous story.\n",
        "After a season of watching inane twitching in the name of dance, the viewer is most happily greeted by Onna White's choreography, an exuberant step-by-step exploration of Victorian zeal.\n",
        "In retrospect, it seems emblematic of the triviality Reed descended to in the last years of his career. The Third Man it's not.\n",
        "Reed is craftsman enough to make an efficient family entertainment out of Lionel Bart's musical, but not artist enough to put back any of Dickens' teeth which Bart had so assiduously drawn.\n",
        "A treasure of a movie.\n",
        "I cannot recall a more marvelous pair of acting performances in any one film.\n",
        "Midnight Cowboy's peep-show vision of Manhattan lowlife may no longer be shocking, but what is shocking, in 1994, is to see a major studio film linger this lovingly on characters who have nothing to offer the audience but their own lost souls.\n",
        "In this film the scenery is lovely and only the human race is vile.\n",
        "The acting, showy and instinctual, is most of the movie; the visual style is too forced and chicly distended to let the drama acquire much natural life of its own.\n",
        "Outrageously overrated at the cynical end of the Swinging Sixties.\n",
        "What has happened to Midnight Cowboy is that we've done our own editing job on it. We've forgotten the excesses and the detours, and remembered the purity of the central characters and the Voight and Hoffman performances.\n",
        "It is ultimately a moving experience that captures the quality of a time and a place. It's not a movie for the ages, but, having seen it, you won't ever again feel detached as you walk down West 42nd Street.\n",
        "The performances by Hoffman and Voight are big.\n",
        "There is only one problem with the excitement generated by this film. After it is over, you will walk out of the theater and, as I did, curse the tedium of your own life. I kept looking for someone who I could throw up against a wall.\n",
        "A knockout police thriller with so much jarring excitement that it almost calls for comic-book expletives. POW! ZOWIE!\n",
        "Producer Philip D'Antoni and screenwriter Ernest Tidyman have added enough fictional flesh to provide director William Friedkin and his overall topnotch cast with plenty of material, and they make the most of it.\n",
        "William Friedkin's symphony of long, sharp shocks is memorable for any number of sequences.\n",
        "Popeye also earned counterculture points by mistakenly shooting a federal agent and exhibiting a conspicuous lack of remorse.\n",
        "This 1971 thriller about a heroin bust is solid, slick filmmaking, full of dirty cops, shrewd operators, and slam-bang action.\n",
        "An urban crime thriller which won undeserved acclaim for its efficient but unremarkable elevated-railway chase and its clumsy, showy emphasis on grainy, sordid realism.\n",
        "The French Connection is as amoral as its hero, as violent, as obsessed and as frightening.\n",
        "It moves at magnificent speed, and exhausts itself in movement.\n",
        "Sylvester Stallone [is] as likable as a basset hound.\n",
        "The story is achingly familiar, and though Stallone has a certain power, he is certainly not the subtlest actor to crawl out from under Marlon's overcoat.\n",
        "There are occasional flashes that the film may be patronizing the lower end of the blue-collar mentality, as much if not more than the characters who keep putting Rocky down on the screen. However, Avildsen is noted for creating such ambiguities.\n",
        "I wanted to like it more than I did, but it'll do.\n",
        "Rocky is an old-fashioned fairytale brilliantly revamped to chime in with the depressed mood of the '70s.\n",
        "The screenplay of Rocky is purest Hollywood make-believe of the 1930's, but there would be nothing wrong with that, had the film been executed with any verve.\n",
        "A description of it would sound like a cliche from beginning to end. But Rocky isn't about a story, it's about a hero. And it's inhabited with supreme confidence by a star.\n",
        "The basic storyline has been done to death over the years; this is still one of the most effective and successful applications of the formula.\n",
        "It's an interesting movie to look back on for its attitudes: In the guise of being a consciousness-raiser it plumps for male tenderness and demonizes the mother who can't recognize how far her workaholic ex-hubbie has come.\n",
        "Kramer Vs. Kramer is a perceptive, touching, intelligent film about one of the raw sores of contemporary America, the dissolution of the family unit.\n",
        "Benton's direction must first be praised for his choice of actors and his collaboration with them.\n",
        "Benton gives his film its depth and complexity by challenging the audience's preconceptions and snap opinions at every turn.\n",
        "Kramer vs. Kramer is definitely a movie to watch together -- your kids may well seek shelter under your arm, glad to know their own families enjoy more peace.\n",
        "Misogynistic claptrap.\n",
        "A high class modern weepie.\n",
        "Kramer vs. Kramer wouldn't be half as good as it is -- half as intriguing and absorbing -- if the movie had taken sides.\n",
        "[A] fine, witty, moving, most intelligent adaptation of Avery Corman's best-selling novel.\n",
        "Although it is extremely well made, I frankly don't understand what the shouting is about. Good, yes; great, no.\n",
        "Like every element in this picture, the actors look right; they seem to emerge from the past, instead of being pasted on to it, as so many characters in historical movies seem to be.\n",
        "No imbalance mars the pic, whose cross-the-board achievement lifts it to an impressive level of unified accomplishment.\n",
        "The battered Britons may have some excuse for enjoying this nostalgic re-creation of empire ideology, but what's ours?\n",
        "Really this is an overblown piece of self-congratulatory emotional manipulation perfectly suited for Thatcherite liberals.\n",
        "This is strange. I have no interest in running and am not a partisan in the British class system. Then why should I have been so deeply moved by Chariots of Fire?\n",
        "It's an exceptional film, about some exceptional people.\n",
        "Appreciation of this picture doesn't demand a love of sports, merely an understanding of human nature.\n",
        "Terms of Endearment is about three relationships and students of screenwriting would do well to study the way in which these three stories are told completely and effortlessly in a movie of average length.\n",
        "Its quirky rhythms and veering emotional tones are very much its own, and they owe less to movie tradition than they do to a sense of how the law of unintended consequences pushes us ceaselessly through the years, permitting no pause for perspective.\n",
        "Brooks' dialog is wonderful throughout and all the characters carry off their assignments beautifully, even down to Danny De Vito and Norman Bennett as MacLaine's other suffering suitors.\n",
        "[Writer-director James L. Brooks] has television in his soul: his people are incredibly tiny (most are defined by a single stroke of obsessive behavior), and he chokes out his narrative in ten-minute chunks, separated by aching lacunae.\n",
        "Then The Illness strikes, and the film changes gear completely, pulling out all the stops.\n",
        "The most remarkable achievement of Terms of Endearment, which is filled with great achievements, is its ability to find the balance between the funny and the sad, between moments of deep truth and other moments of high ridiculousness.\n",
        "A funny, touching, beautifully acted film that covers more territory than it can easily manage.\n",
        "The relationship of Karen and Denys is a prickly and, despite the era in which it is set, curiously modern one. It's also at the heart of this understated movie.\n",
        "Streep may convince us utterly that she is in love with Africa, but our views of it are a little too stately to really feel the place.\n",
        "My basic problem with this otherwise sumptuous and well-acted film is that I never was able to accept Redford in character.\n",
        "Out of Africa is, at last, the free-spirited, fullhearted gesture that everyone has been waiting for the movies to make all decade long. It reclaims the emotional territory that is rightfully theirs.\n",
        "Maybe the problem of the pacing is simply the nature of the beast these days with expensive period pieces. Once the difficult details are all in place, it may be too much to expect a director to resist milking every scene for more than it's worth.\n",
        "Sydney Pollack applies craftsmanship and restraint to a classic plot curve of longing, fulfillment, and loss, and although the denouement is a bit overextended, he never yields to facile, insistent sentimentality -- his effects are honestly won.\n",
        "For all that it may come out of Africa, the film's final destination is not many miles from Disneyland.\n",
        "With the exception of Miss Streep's performance, the pleasures of Out of Africa are all peripheral -- David Watkin's photography, the landscapes, the shots of animal life -all of which would fit neatly into a National Geographic layout.\n",
        "Out of Africa is a great movie to look at, breathtakingly filmed on location. It is a movie with the courage to be about complex, sweeping emotions, and to use the star power of its actors without apology.\n",
        "It tells a grand love story in less-than-grand fashion but is nevertheless worth seeing because of all the other things it does right.\n",
        "It is a hesitant, conservative approach that yields great elegance and a rhythm that carries the viewer along. Yet the film is haunted by a sense of opportunities not taken, of an artist deliberately reining in his artistry.\n",
        "If there is such a thing as voluptuous detachment, Bertolucci and John Lone have found it. Lone's achievement in his absorbing account of Pu Yi is to place him at a distance and yet make his plight totally involving.\n",
        "There's probably a truly great movie in the story of Pu Yi, but The Last Emperor is not that movie. Still, what director Bernardo Bertolucci (Last Tango in Paris) has accomplished here is both ambitious and impressive.\n",
        "As coolly lavish an epic as we may ever see.\n",
        "The expanse of time is saturated with an expanse of visual beauty that feels absolutely right for the story.\n",
        "It works astonishingly well.\n",
        "Constantly absorbing and tremendously interesting.\n",
        "John Lone is superb as the sad mediocrity; and if spectacle finally triumphs over sympathy, it is not without a decent struggle.\n",
        "It's a tribute to the film's intelligence and its feeling for dialectics that it views both the Forbidden City and the detention center as prisons, and that when Pu Yi winds up as a gardener there's a sense of gain as well as loss.\n",
        "The Last Emperor is like an elegant travel brochure. It piques the curiosity. One wants to go. Ultimately it's a let-down.\n",
        "Everything involving the life of Pu Yi was a waste. Everything except one thing: the notion that a single human life could have infinite value.\n",
        "A remarkable achievement.\n",
        "We need more than elegant parallels and lavish production values. We need tension, characterization, drama.\n",
        "Everything about the acting and direction of Rain Man is so exquisitely calibrated and so right that it's all too easy to forget how much could have gone wrong.\n",
        "A fascinating, often very moving, frequently funny film.\n",
        "It's an honorable effort, touched by a certain lightness and grace.\n",
        "What no one can argue is that Rain Man is Cruise's quantum leap, so that it can be said unblushingly that he holds his own with the masterly Hoffman.\n",
        "The strength of the film is really that of Cruise's performance, his finest since Risky Business.\n",
        "Rain Man's restraint is, finally, rather like Raymond's gabble. It discourages connections, keeping you out instead of drawing you in.\n",
        "Uneven, slightly off-target.\n",
        "Valeria Golino is appealing as Cruise's girlfriend; Hoffman makes his character pretty believable without milking the part for pathos and tears, and it's nice to see Cruise working for a change in a context that isn't determined by hard sell and hype.\n",
        "There is no story, no motor, and given the nature of the premise, nothing much can happen.\n",
        "Its end effect depends largely on one's susceptibility to the sight of an actor acting nonstop and extremely well, but to no particularly urgent dramatic purpose.\n",
        "Rain Man is so fascinating because it refuses to supply those questions with sentimental but unrealistic answers.\n",
        "Neither Levinson nor Hoffman was able to penetrate the mystery of their subject.\n",
        "Rain Man is far from a washout but you can't help feeling all those missed opportunities raining down on you.\n",
        "Driving Miss Daisy spans a quarter-century in the intricate relationship of a Southern dowager and her chauffeur, and it is a movie that invites you to appreciate the passage of time in more than one way.\n",
        "Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman give exceptional performances\n",
        "Freeman and Tandy have their own performer's pride, and that transfers to their characters. Tandy, in particular, is almost astringent in her denial of easy emotion.\n",
        "This is a story about people, not politics. And perhaps because we can see the actors in closeup on the screen, that is even truer of the movie than the play.\n",
        "For Tandy, it's her most substantial film role since her sublime work in Alfred Hitchcock`s 1963 The Birds, and she takes full advantage of it; never playing for sympathy, she earns it completely.\n",
        "Alfred Uhry's adaptation of his Pulitzer-prizewinning play aspires more to complex observation of human behavior than to simple moralism about it. Precisely because it has its priorities straight, it succeeds superbly on both levels.\n",
        "Bruce Beresford's sensitive direction complements Alfred Uhry's skillful adapation of his Pulitzer Prize-winning play.\n",
        "The movie also has something legitimate and instructive to say about the subtlety and intricacy of everyday race relations in the south during the period covered (roughly 1948 to '73).\n",
        "Far too cosy to serve as an effective social or political metaphor; better to regard it as a solid ensemble piece.\n",
        "There is an exhilarating, singularly theatrical lightness of touch that is often lost when these settings are made manifest in a movie.\n",
        "This is Tandy's finest two hours onscreen in a film career that goes back to 1932.\n",
        "The story holds a potential for sap that is mostly unfulfilled thanks to Beresford's stately approach, the stars' better judgment and the protagonists' sharp wits.\n",
        "Driving Miss Daisy is a film of great love and patience, telling a story that takes 25 years to unfold, exploring its characters as few films take the time to do.\n",
        "The movie gets you mainly because Morgan Freeman, who played chauffeur Hoke Colburn in the original stage production (and won his third Obie for it), takes the wheel and drives Daisy all the way home.\n",
        "Whatever its genesis, Allen's scraggly rhetoric evolved into the dominant comic style of the 70s.\n",
        "A few good laughs in an 85-minute film do not a comedy make.\n",
        "It has plenty of hilarious jokes and concepts, like the ventriloquists' dummies at prison visiting time, and the return home from a chaingang break with five shackled cons in tow.\n",
        "Allen has made a movie that is, in effect, a feature-length, two-reel comedy -- something very special and eccentric and funny.\n",
        "Woody Allen's Take the Money and Run has some very funny moments, and you'll laugh a lot, but in the last analysis it isn't a very funny movie.\n",
        "[Fonda] makes all the right choices, from the mechanics of her walk and her voice inflection to the penetration of the girl's raging psyche. It is a rare performance.\n",
        "For once, a genuinely psychological thriller.\n",
        "With Fonda and Sutherland, you have actors who understand and sympathize with their characters, and you have a vehicle worthy of that sort of intelligence. So the fact that the thriller stuff doesn't always work isn't so important.\n",
        "Pakula, when he is not indulging in subjective camera, strives to give his film the look of structural geometry, but despite the sharp edges and dramatic spaces and cinema presence out of Citizen Kane, it all suggests a tepid, rather tasteless mush.\n",
        "Repo Man has the type of unerring energy that leaves audiences breathless and entertained.\n",
        "Cox's style is a step beyond camp into a comedy of pure disgust; much of the film is churlishly unpleasant, but there's a core of genuine anger that gives the project an emotional validation lacking in the flabby American comedies of the early 80s.\n",
        "There are endless things to enjoy, from Robby Muller's crisp camerawork to a superb set of performances, from witty movie parodies to a tremendous punk soundtrack.\n",
        "Repo Man comes out of left field, has no big stars, didn't cost much, takes chances, dares to be unconventional, is funny, and works. There is a lesson here.\n",
        "It's very entertaining, and though it's rude in an R-rated way, it has the good taste never to promise more than it can deliver.\n",
        "Whit Stillman's crafty independent feature about wealthy Park Avenue teenagers and a middle-class boy who joins their ranks over one Christmas vacation is certainly well imagined, and impressively acted by a cast of newcomers.\n",
        "Filmmaker Whit Stillman makes a strikingly original debut with Metropolitan, a glib, ironic portrait of the vulnerable young heirs to Manhattan's disappearing debutante scene.\n",
        "None of Stillman's endearing characters quite fits their prescribed social context, and in its exhilarated final movement, Metropolitan finds an exit out of the stifling UHB salon.\n",
        "True appreciation for this movie may be restricted to those with firsthand experience in this kind of world, or a certain upper-haute stamina.\n",
        "Not very much happens in Metropolitan, and yet everything that happens is felt deeply, because the characters in this movie are still too young to have perfected their defenses against life.\n",
        "Like chamber music, Metropolitan is sprightly, intimate and all too self-aware.\n",
        "In nine hours of threatening, bickering and, eventually, poignant (but never maudlin) self-revelation, the stereotypes dissolve and re-form.\n",
        "John Hughes's 1985 film seems meant to explain 80s youngsters to yesterday's youth, and comes to the comforting conclusion that they're just as alienated, idealistic, and vulnerable as the baby boomers of the 1960s.\n",
        "Does director John Hughes really believe, as he writes here, that 'when you grow up, your heart dies.' It may. But not unless the brain has already started to rot with films like this.\n",
        "An iconic movie of the '80s, with all the unappealing baggage that suggests.\n",
        "The Breakfast Club doesn't need earthshaking revelations; it's about kids who grow willing to talk to one another, and it has a surprisingly good ear for the way they speak.\n",
        "Mr. Hughes, having thought up the characters and simply flung them together, should have left well enough alone.\n",
        "In The Breakfast Club, Hughes has created a surprisingly enduring motion picture that is still effective 13 years after its theatrical debut.\n",
        "Episodic treatment is punched up by an imaginative series of special effects.\n",
        "The film hangs reasonably well together, not least because of good performances from all concerned.\n",
        "Mr. Patton and Miss Myers make likable teen-age heroes, and Mr. Englund actually turns Freddy into a welcome presence.\n",
        "Debuting director Chuck Russell elicits poor performances from most of his thesps, making it difficult to differentiate between pic's comic relief and unintended howlers.\n",
        "A creepy score and Russell's sure grasp of the skewed logic of nightmares helps to sustain the ambiguity between the 'real' and 'dream' worlds, while Englund's Freddie now fits like a glove.\n",
        "The film's dream sequences are ingenious, and they feature some remarkable nightmare images and special effects.\n",
        "While it's better than its predecessor, it's still not quite up to its inspiration.\n",
        "This is filmmaking by the numbers, without soul.\n",
        "Consistently watchable and inventive.\n",
        "Robert Englund, receiving star billing for the first time, is delightful in his frequent incarnations as Freddy, delivering his gag lines with relish and making the grisly proceedings funny.\n",
        "While some of the monotonous effects are strikingly surreal, Harlin's direction creates an atmosphere which is more morbid than scary.\n",
        "Though the Elm Street series contains the most intelligent premise in current genre films, none of the movies take much advantage of their potential.\n",
        "As always, the teen actors are disposable, and even Robert Englund seems to be sleepwalking through Freddy.\n",
        "The series here takes a depressing nosedive into zero-degree filmmaking.\n",
        "Fifth edition of the hit Nightmare series is a poorly constructed special effects showcase.\n",
        "A flimsily plotted but visually impressive addition to the endless Freddy Krueger saga.\n",
        "A genre film that won't totally insult your intelligence or your eyes.\n",
        "As for Englund, he still looks as if he's been working at Domino's too long, and he still sounds as if he's stealing his material from Don Rickles.\n",
        "Sixth and final edition in the Nightmare on Elm Street feature series delivers enough violence, black humor and even a final reel in 3-D to hit paydirt with horror-starved audiences.\n",
        "Even the much-heralded 3-D finale is murky and unimaginative.\n",
        "The Elm Street films have always been a cut above the competition, so to speak, with their playfully malevolent dream sequences and their mocking, ever-resourceful villain.\n",
        "So long, Freddy, it's been good to know you.\n",
        "For all its shoddiness, the film manages, just barely, to achieve its ignoble goals -- it delivers what it promises.\n",
        "A tame, poorly plotted serving of schlock, less horrific for its ketchup-smeared murders than for the bare-faced fashion in which it tries and fails to rip off Carpenter's Halloween in matters of style and construction.\n",
        "The whole film is one of the best arguments for resuming movie censorship to come along in years.\n",
        "Friday the 13th was dreadful and took in more than $17 million. Friday the 13th Part 2 was just as bad and took in more than $10 million. Friday the 13th Part III is terrible, too.\n",
        "Eventually, the novelty wears off, and what remains is the now-familiar spectacle of nice, dumb kids being lopped, chopped and perforated.\n",
        "The murderous Jason is back in the latest chapter of the most offensive series in film history, unless Burt Reynolds makes three more Smokey and the Bandit pictures real quick.\n",
        "The end result is a bit of a mess but hugely enjoyable, and often (thanks to Dean Cundey's camerawork and John Carpenter's close supervision as producer) as striking visually as its predecessors.\n",
        "This is one of those Identikit movies, assembled out of familiar parts from other, better movies.\n",
        "Mr. Wallace clearly has a fondness for the cliches he is parodying and he does it with style.\n",
        "Fourth entry in the Halloween horror series is a no-frills, workmanlike picture.\n",
        "The shocks are infinitesimal, the script diabolical.\n",
        "It seems the latest stage in some curious evolutionary pattern; the slasher species keeps proliferating and getting weaker at the same time.\n",
        "H4 is very much the cheap knockoff of its prototype, but not half as visceral.\n",
        "Of all the Halloween sequels, including the irrelevant and unwatchable Halloween III, Halloween 4 stands out as the best of a generally uninspired lot.\n",
        "A bit more refined in its details than the conventional horror movie.\n",
        "A prime example of the principle of diminishing reruns.\n",
        "By far the worst 'slasher movie' remake to date, replaying all the cliches, but delivering none of the guilty pleasures.\n",
        "There's no need to wear a corsage to Prom Night. And leaving your higher brain functions at home might be a good idea, too.\n",
        "A bland, timid and thoroughly un-thrilling teen thriller.\n",
        "There's absolutely zippo to fear about this movie, unless you're the kind of person who jumps when formula bogeymen do exactly what you'd expect them to do.\n",
        "There's no suspense or perversity. You don't care who lives or who dies -- just please make it soon.\n",
        "There's nothing scary in there, but here's a shudder-inducing fact: McCormick and Cardone are currently collaborating on a remake of the witty and nearly perfect 1987 thriller, The Stepfather.\n",
        "For a film about erotomania, Prom Night is a curiously flaccid affair.\n",
        "About as spine-tingling as an algebra exam.\n",
        "It's a bore, even taking into account unintentional moments of humor that resulted in audience members jeering. This is a case study for Filmmaking Ineptitude 101.\n",
        "Prom night is a night you're supposed to treasure, or at least remember 'forever.' This one is forgotten by the time you throw your empty popcorn bucket into the trash cans conveniently located near the exits on your way out.\n",
        "A surprisingly effective teen-skewing thriller that soft-pedals graphic violence (in marked contrast to the R-rated 1980 original) while generating a fair degree of suspense.\n",
        "The film delivers honest special-effects shocks without forfeiting its good nature.\n",
        "Given the talents, Poltergeist is an annoying film because it could have been so much better.\n",
        "Though the shocks are well conveyed, it's the sweetness that lingers, making this the first cute and cuddly entry in the genre.\n",
        "It is consistently redeemed by its creator's dazzling sense of craft.\n",
        "Hooper and Spielberg hold our interest by observing the everyday rituals of this family so closely that, since the family seems real, the weird events take on a certain credibility by association.\n",
        "Poltergeist is like a thoroughly enjoyable nightmare, one that you know that you can always wake up from, and one in which, at the end, no one has permanently been damaged. It's also witty in a fashion that Alfred Hitchcock might have appreciated.\n",
        "This sequel, sans Spielberg but obedient to his spirit, simply fails to regenerate the original's gut-grinding fears...\n",
        "Seems like a string of special effects held together by a far-fetched story line with an unsatisfying sticky-sweet ending.\n",
        "I loved it.\n",
        "It's good stuff but, basically, The Exorcist is a museum piece, something to be enjoyed for its historical value, its datedness and its almost quaint shock value.\n",
        "Some movies aren't just movies. They're closer to voodoo -- they channel currents larger and more powerful than themselves.\n",
        "Friedkin and Blatty seem to care nothing for their characters as people, only as victims-props to be abused, hurled about the room, beaten and, in one case, brutally murdered.\n",
        "The Exorcist is not an unintelligently put-together film, which makes one all the more impatient with it.\n",
        "If movies are, among other things, opportunities for escapism, then The Exorcist is one of the most powerful ever made.\n",
        "There's something elemental about The Exorcist.\n",
        "There is nothing dated about The Exorcist, which remains an effective excursion into demonic possession more than a quarter of a century after it was first unveiled to the public.\n",
        "An expert telling of a supernatural horror story.\n",
        "This 1973 horror thriller is highly instructive as well as unnerving.\n",
        "A wildly original roller-coaster ride of hilarious mischief.\n",
        "A horror-comedy about cute little Christmas toy/pets who turn into murderous monsters wreaking havoc on a Norman Rockwellian town.\n",
        "The humans are little more than dress-extras for the mechanics.\n",
        "What's confusing yet ultimately illuminating is the way his gremlins function as a free-floating metaphor, suggesting at separate junctures everything from teenagers to blacks to various Freudian suppressions.\n",
        "Dante is perhaps the first filmmaker since Frank Tashlin to base his style on the formal free-for-all of animated cartoons; he is also utterly heartless.\n",
        "Dante gleefully sinks his teeth into the kind of fluffy, sugary, sickly small town fantasy beloved of his pal and sometime producer Spielberg.\n",
        "At the level of Serious Film Criticism, it's a meditation on the myths in our movies: Christmas, families, monsters, retail stores, movies, boogeymen. At the level of Pop Moviegoing, it's a sophisticated, witty B movie.\n",
        "Gremlins is far more interested in showing off its knowledge of movie lore and making random jokes than in providing consistent entertainment.\n",
        "This uninhibited and uproarious monster bash, directed by Joe Dante, is more quick-witted and ironic than the original; it sets forth a savvy, slaphappy agenda before the opening credits and follows it straight through to the end, and even beyond.\n",
        "An hilarious sequel featuring equal parts creature slapstick for the small fry and satirical barbs for adults.\n",
        "There's almost enough in-joke ingenuity to justify the total absence of plot.\n",
        "Speaks to the gleeful hell-raising monster in each of us, and it speaks with much more verve, cleverness and good humor than the film on which it is based. Add this to the very short list of sequels that neatly surpass their predecessors.\n",
        "Too many gremlins and not enough story line.\n",
        "Wicked fun.\n",
        "For a good hour it's less like a wild-spirited comedy than a '60s Disney film with Dean Jones or Fred MacMurray.\n",
        "A devilishly, hysterically, cacklingly, subversively funny picture that builds and builds until it literally self-destructs.\n",
        "It's a charmless exercise: director Richard Donner turns the kids into shrieking ferrets, and his jumpy cutting seems to lag behind the action deliberately in a curious attempt to make the film seem more chaotic and cluttered.\n",
        "While the pre-pubescents continually scream, their doting parents prove equally odious in a finale of astounding sentimentality.\n",
        "The Goonies is a smooth mixture of the usual ingredients from Steven Spielberg action movies, made special because of the high-energy performances of the kids who have the adventures.\n",
        "The Goonies has every imaginable funhouse flourish. It has crooks, bats, cobwebs, skeletons, a lovable monster, an underground grotto and a treasure hidden by some of the most considerate, clue-loving pirates who ever lived.\n",
        "Polish Wedding is a confident, light drama.\n",
        "A nearly laugh-free comedy!\n",
        "Pregnant With Problems!\n",

        "The somewhat plausible and proximate horrors in the story of Soylent Green carry the production over its awkward spots to the status of a good futuristic exploitation film.\n",
        "Uneven and slightly muddled futuristic horror story -- not really science fiction, more like an antipollution PSA gone berserk.\n",
        "Good, solid stuff, assembled efficiently enough to be pretty persuasive.\n",
        "Their 21st-century New York occasionally is frightening but it is rarely convincingly real.\n",
        "Occasionally it strikes one that [Lang] wanted to include too much and then that all one anticipates does not appear. But at the same time the various ideas have been spliced together quite adroitly.\n",
        "Each frame of this classic is drop-dead stunning.\n",
        "One of the last examples of the imaginative -- but often monstrous -- grandeur of the Golden Period of the German film, Metropolis is a spectacular example of Expressionist design.\n",
        "I have just had a sensational night at the movies, and the picture was only 83 years old.\n",
        "A fully realized work of art whose influence on science fiction, set design and symbolism can scarcely be put into words.\n",
        "Too bad that so much really artistic work was wasted on this manufactured story.\n",
        "This movie is certifiably nuts and naive in many ways, but it is so exciting.\n",
        "There's no denying either the influence of Lang's vision -- so much of what he did in this film lives on that we take it as cultural assumption -- or the still valid energy of his storytelling.\n",
        "Here's a coincidence: The first must-see movie of 2010 is also the must-see movie of 1927. The difference is that you can actually see it now. Or most of it.\n",
        "To see the film as the director intended, on the big screen with an original score recorded by a 60-piece orchestra, greatly enhances the reputation of a film already considered one of the icons of the silent era.\n",
        "The extended version -- the additional footage is easy to spot because it's rather worn and a slightly different size -- provides more of the extraordinary performance by the teenage Helm.\n",
        "Who cares that the found footage is scratchy and scarred by time? It's all that easier to identify what we once thought was gone forever -- and what now adds even more depth to a delirious, dreamlike class parable...\n",
        "The design is impeccable and still a touchstone of steamy modernism.\n",
        "Lang's impossibly vast skyscraper-ziggurats (inspired, it's said, by his first view of the Manhattan skyline) are the blueprint for nearly every science-fiction movie city of the past 30 years.\n",
        "The great Fritz Lang created this chilling 1926 evocation of a mechanized utopia run by underground slave labor.\n",
        "The film looks fabulous, and Gottfried Huppertz's original score is another worthy addition.\n",
        "You've seen the rest; now see the best.\n",
        "Building on earlier science fiction and endlessly influential on later works, Lang's film is a mammoth marvel, fusing modernism and expressionism, art deco and Biblical spectacle, Wagnerian bombast, sentimental Marxism and religiose millenarianism.\n",
        "The stunning cinematography, made crisper by present-day technology, and the film's overall visual concept continue to make your jaw drop with admiration.\n",
        "The restoration eliminates nearly all the distracting cracks and splices and stabilizes images that were previously jittery, allowing us to admire them in all their complex glory.\n",
        "Zemeckis' fascination with having characters interact at different ages of their lives hurts the film visually, and strains credibility past the breaking point, by forcing him to rely on some very cheesy makeup designs.\n",
        "By the end, you may feel that you've just sat through a feature-length commercial for both part one (which has to be seen to make this sequel comprehensible) and part three (a trailer for it literally ends part two).\n",
        "It's impressive entertainment, and best of all, it never degenerates into Spielbergian sentimentality: you can laugh, be thrilled and think without feeling embarrassed.\n",
        "It manages to be giddily and merrily mind-boggling rather than confusing.\n",
        "Cleverly plotted, but commercially overloaded.\n",
        "The latest must-see, peer pressure, carve the logo on your head, designer blue jean experience.\n",
        "The movie is fun, mostly because it's so screwy.\n",
        "The simplicity of plot, and the wide expansiveness of its use of space, are a refreshing change from the convoluted, visually cramped and cluttered second part.\n",
        "This is a good deal more likable than part two because the product plugs have been held back, and Zemeckis is clearly having fun alluding to his favorite westerns; there's also a certain sweetness and charm in the Lloyd-Steenburgen romance.\n",
        "Affectionate, innovative, and vaguely lunatic.\n",
        "Except for Mr. Lloyd, the film is so sweet-natured and bland that it is almost instantly forgettable.\n",
        "Divinely frivolous, nearly perfect fun.\n",
        "Ties up all the loose ends but runs out of energy and inspiration.\n",
        "Makes a few bows in the direction of time-travel complexities, and then settles down to be a routine Western comedy.\n",
        "Flubber provides fuel for a very funny piece of hyperbolic humor in the grand American tradition of Paul Bunyan, and Director Robert Stevenson and Scriptwriter Bill Walsh get plenty of bounce out of every ounce.\n",
        "MacMurray is ideally cast as the car-hopping prof, and plays the role with warmth and gusto.\n",
        "The film is an authentic children's entertainment and quite the merriest of its kind that Hollywood has turned loose on the nation's screens in a long time.\n",
        "This is a kid's movie rife with all the Freudian squalor that Disney repressed.\n",
        "This animated feature based on Felix Salten's book about the coming of age of a fawn and his various forest friends (including the beloved Thumper) does convey some of the primal emotional power of Disney's features during this period.\n",
        "For the first time, Disney has done his backgrounds in oils instead of watercolors. The result is striking.\n",
        "The glow and texture of the Disney brush reach new heights, especially in the treatment of a summer thunderstorm and a raging snowstorm.\n",
        "From Disney's richest period, interleaving splendid animation with vulgar Americana.\n",
        "In colors that would surprise even the spectrum itself, Disney's cartoon craftsmen have re-created a woodland that shimmers and glows and darkens altogether magically.\n",
        "This incisive study of sex as an arena for manipulative power games takes too long to catch fire and suffers from a deficient central performance.\n",
        "The creepy plot still holds a certain fascination.\n",
        "A sombre, manipulative affair in which the dA (C)cor is never allowed to usurp our interest.\n",
        "Witty, entertaining, if occasionally overripe.\n",
        "Director Stephen Frears accelerates entertainingly through Christopher Hampton's wig-and-powder sado-comedy about sexual mind games in 18th-century France.\n",
        "Tantalizingly wicked -- watching it makes the color rise to your cheeks.\n",
        "An absorbing and seductive movie.\n",
        "In an age of post-Christian facetiousness, Martin Scorsese's work daringly attempts to restore passion and melodrama to the Gospel story.\n",
        "A film of challenging ideas, and not salacious provocations.\n",
        "Concentrating on the humanity and fallibility of Jesus in continual conflict with his divinity, the film falters as a contemporary statement mainly in its primitive view of women.\n",
        "A sincere, typically ambitious and imaginative work from America's most provocatively intelligent film-maker.\n",
        "What emerges most memorably is its sense of absolute conviction, never more palpable than in the final fantasy sequence that removes Jesus from the cross and creates for him the life of an ordinary man.\n",
        "Among those who do not already have rigid views on the subject, this film is likely to inspire more serious thought on the nature of Jesus than any other ever made.\n",
        "In spite of all [Scorsese] accomplishes, he is unable to bring Jesus close to us, to realize his stated goal of creating a universal figure who symbolizes the spiritual anguish of all men.\n",
        "There are too many epic moments and impassioned performances to dismiss Scorsese's work.\n",
        "The film is a slow fuse with a big bang -- one that echoes through every family whose own tragedy is an aching for things past and loved ones lost.\n",
        "The movie, a heady thicket of political intrigue and double crosses, is slower, talkier, and more prosaic than the first two films, and its narrative seams sometimes show. And yet it's more than the sum of its mazelike convolutions.\n",
        "The Godfather Part III matches its predecessors in narrative intensity, epic scope, socio-political analysis, physical beauty and deep feeling for its characters and milieu.\n",
        "Represents a certain moral improvement over its predecessors by refusing to celebrate and condemn violence and duplicity in the same breath, or at least to the same degree.\n",
        "The acting is merely passable, several characters are given nothing to do, and Michael's paranoid self-pity lends the film an absurd morality: Coppola expects us to sympathise with the semblance of virtue.\n",
        "Most film sequels are strictly optional. The Godfather Part III is inevitable, and as such it's irresistible.\n",
        "It may be that Coppola was right to put off filing this last installment all these years; from the evidence here, he had nothing more to say.\n",
        "The Godfather Part III is a good movie, with moments of rare power, but it is not a great one -- a reason why many fans of the series have voiced their disappointment.\n",
        "It is, I suspect, not even possible to understand this film without knowing the first two, and yet, knowing them, Part III works better than it should, evokes the same sense of wasted greatness, of misdirected genius.\n",
        "[An] offer director Francis Ford Coppola should have refused.\n",
        "Where Nabokov was witty, Kubrick is sometimes merely snide, but fine performances (particularly from Peter Sellers, as the ominous Clare Quilty) cover most of the rough spots.\n",
        "Far more satisfying than his later works (one hesitates to call them mere movies).\n",
        "The picture has a rare power, a garbled but often moving push toward an off-beat communication.\n",
        "Spielberg accomplishes these goals with a technical virtuosity that no other director, arguably in the history of the cinema, can even approach.\n",
        "Saving Private Ryan is the war movie to end all war movies. It's the ultimate combat film, far outdistancing what until now had been the genre's World War II classics.\n",
        "The cast functions as an effective and believable unit. And Hanks gives a strong, increasingly solemn performance as its mysterious leader.\n",
        "Dramatic lapses notwithstanding, Saving Private Ryan goes beyond technical dazzlement to put a new, indelibly terrible face on war.\n",
        "Anyone who would like to know what superb filmmaking is all about need look no further than this overpowering movie.\n",
        "What Steven Spielberg has accomplished in Saving Private Ryan is to make violence terrible again. Nothing in the movie's melodramatic narrative can diminish the shocking immediacy of its combat scenes.\n",
        "Searing, heartbreaking, so intense it turns your body into a single tube of clenched muscle, this is simply the greatest war movie ever made, and one of the great American movies.\n",
        "Spielberg goes a long, long way toward overcoming his tendencies toward the shallow, but the visceral punch of his not-quite-masterful film is softened by an almost neurotic slickness that keeps getting in the way of the [issues it raises].\n",
        "Spielberg obviously decided that blood and guts meant just that, and so he arranged his violence into a semblance of pure disorder. The illusion holds, complete with severed limbs and wellsprings of blood, and it feels honorable.\n",
        "Saving Private Ryan is Steven Spielberg's best war film and one of the two or three best movies the director has made.\n",
        "The great Hollywood battle films have told us repeatedly that war is hell. Saving Private Ryan, more than any other, is the one that shows it.\n",
        "War may be a faceless affair, but war movies shouldn't be.\n",
        "No further commentary is needed when the raw brutality of combat is presented as indelibly as it is here.\n",
        "I found it tediously manipulative despite its Herculean energy.\n",
        "Why did Spielberg make it? He wants us to imagine we can feel the terror of being there, but does that make us any wiser about this or any other conflict? Probably not.\n",
        "The greatest Steven Spielberg movie since the last great one? Sure.\n",
        "A powerful and impressive milestone in the realistic depiction of combat, Saving Private Ryan is as much an experience we live through as a film we watch on screen.\n",
        "For all the care and thoughtfulness that follow in the story, I never could shake the impression that all I was watching was every other war film Spielberg had ever seen.\n",
        "As compelling, intimate and brutally realistic an account of men at war as you've ever seen.\n",
        "A powerful experience.\n",
        "In this genial but strained and arch frolic, the one real joke is not only \"in\" but it wears thin and even frantic.\n",
        "The characters, though cute and cuddly and sweet and mean and ugly and simply awful, don't really have much to do that would remain of interest to any but the youngest minds.\n",
        "It's quite good, though by the impossible standards the film sets for itself it inevitably falls short.\n",
        "As usual it is technically excellent, but the charm, characterisation and sheer good humour that made features like Pinocchio and Jungle Book so enjoyable are sadly absent.\n",
        "This is the 25th full-length animated feature from Walt Disney studios, and professionally put together as it is, many of the ingredients may seem programmed to those who have seen some of the others.\n",
        "The backgrounds are as richly textured and detailed as in any other Disney film.\n",
        "By the end of The Black Cauldron I was remembering, with something of a shock of nostalgia, the strength and utter storytelling conviction of the early Disney animators. The Black Cauldron is a return to the tradition.\n",
        "It is good to see the Disney craftsmen doing what they do best on such a grand and risky scale. If one has time for only one space opera this season, this is the one to choose.\n",
        "Disney's most ambitious and costly production to date -- about a spaceship crew which encounters a Black Hole and a long-lost madman -- and if looks were everything, you could hardly fault it.\n",
        "It cost half as much as Star Trek and looks better -- not as lavish, perhaps, but more original. The special effects are fancy, and the design even more so.\n",
        "Takes us all the way to the rim of space only to bog us down in a talky melodrama whipped up out of mad scientists and haunted houses.\n",
        "Cheetah brings to focus the concerns of experts and laymen alike.\n",
        "An ideological intervention from the Disney machine: the Cold War re-heated for the kiddies.\n",
        "It is painless and chaste, and it has a lot of beautiful scenery and beautiful clothes. There are worse things to watch while you eat popcorn.\n",
        "[An] overpoweringly charming concoction of standard Gaelic tall stories, fantasy and romance.\n",
        "For those of a sentimental turn, there is the delight of watching young Connery romancing the ineffably wholesome Janet Munro, a couple of years before things turned nasty for Commander Bond at Crab Key with the somewhat more knowing Ursula Andress.\n",
        "The script has its moments, especially when Cosby is around as the Devil's aide, but the film finally subsides in a welter of structural flaws and heartwarming sentiment.\n",
        "The performances are attractive though, with one exception, not especially memorable.\n",
        "When the film shifts into the action mode in its second half -- the flying saucer returns to aid in David`s rescue -- it becomes quite bright and lively.\n",
        "If there is more than a little something borrowed from Spielberg, Kleiser's movie is amiably undemanding entertainment that says the right things, albeit without great originality.\n",
        "There's no mistaking Flight of the Navigator for a really first-rate children's picture like, say, The Black Stallion. But Flight of the Navigator is an enjoyable film that encourages kids to use their heads.\n",
        "Whereas its plot may be derivative--and at several junctures, unconvincing--\"Flight of the Navigator\" nevertheless manages to develop considerable humor and poignancy from David's predicament and what he does about it.\n",
        "This children's adventure turns out to be, despite its title, less of a Star Wars trip than an entertaining variation on the time-travel adventure Back to the Future.\n",
        "Instead of creating an eye-opening panorama, Flight of the Navigator looks through the small end of the telescope. Life on Earth is magnified but without an expansive vision.\n",
        "One for the none too discerning youngster.\n",
        "This is a film with its head in the clouds, its feet on the ground and -- just often enough -- its heart on its sleeve, in which space-age special effects take second place to family emotions.\n",
        "At times a bit too precious, especially inside the young navigator's spacecraft, but the warm regard for character, as well as for our often-inhospitable planetary home, makes for a reasonably good time.\n",
        "As usual with film noir, however, it is the villain who steals the heart and one is rooting for in the breathtaking showdown high up in the cogs and ratchets of Big Ben.\n",
        "Small children may be afraid of some of the bad characters -- the Disney Studio's gift for creating really nasty bad guys means that they are scary -- but they will love the cute, brave mice and cheer their triumphs. Adults will enjoy the wit and style.\n",
        "It's a lot of fun.\n",
        "It's not surprising that they haven't got around to changing the plot formula, only the scenery.\n",
        "A cheerful, four-cylinder children's movie, though its car jokes aren't good for much mileage.\n",
        "[It's] in the best tradition of Disney -- and even better than that, because it is not so juvenile that adults won't be thoroughly entertained.\n",
        "Sterling entertainment...\n",
        "As sweet, straightforward and funny as its title.\n",
        "Though it relies on special effects, this cutie-pie caper never loses sight of the protagonists amid the bigger-than-life Cheerios and 40-foot blades of grass.\n",
        "The special effects are all there, nicely in place, and the production values are sound, but the movie is dead in the water.\n",
        "I was bored well before the end, but found the first half hour pretty funny.\n",
        "Jenny McCarthy and Ernest Borgnine -- together at last.\n",
        "Their incessant, obscene banter is meant to be endearing; their total lack of presence makes it simply annoying.\n",
        "What kind of movie is it where Yasmine Bleeth is the best thing about it?\n",
        "The vulgar, obvious humor of Zucker brother David and South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone elicits easy, guilty laughs, yet the material has an underlying innocence that's just shy of good clean fun.\n",
        "The kind of flick that serves itself up as the object of its own satire.\n",
        "If you're old enough to see this movie without a parent or guardian and all that sounds encouraging, this review has failed, and failed badly.\n",
        "The comedy sets up some very big targets -- the commercialization of sport, crass franchise owners, sentimental idolatry of players, exploitation of foreign workers by superstar merchandisers -- and then lobs tiny spitballs at them.\n",
        "[A] funny, gleefully offensive spoof of professional sports.\n",
        "It's not very funny and tries to buy laughs with puerile shocks.\n",
        "A bit late in the day, but nevertheless welcome.\n",
        "Each change of angle and shift of light evokes an inner disturbance; the actors seem to push through the dense shadow as through water, revealing fast people in slow motion ...\n",
        "Direction by Jacques Tourneur pays close attention to mood development, achieving realistic flavor that is further emphasized by real life settings and topnotch lensing by Nicholas Musuraca.\n",
        "The most delicate and nuanced of film noirs, graced with a reflective lyricism that almost lifts it out of the genre.\n",
        "All these B movie poets were under contract to RKO in the winter of 1946, and produced the best movie of everyone involved -- once seen, never forgotten.\n",
        "One of the greatest of all film noirs.\n",
        "It's very snappy and quite intriguingly played by a cast that has been well and smartly directed by Jacques Tourneur.\n",
        "Cinematic perfection, a Hollywood classic that's as great and as enjoyable as its reputation has promised.\n",
        "Literate, oldfashioned, soul-filling and thoroughly romantic.\n",
        "David Lean's 1965 adaptation of Pasternak's romance of the Russian Revolution is intelligent and handsomely mounted, though it doesn't use its length to build to a particularly complex emotional effect.\n",
        "One of the most meticulously designed and executed films.\n",
        "Steiger and Courtenay excepted, all the performances are very uncomfortable.\n",
        "Mr. Bolt has reduced the vast upheaval of the Russian Revolution to the banalities of a doomed romance.\n",
        "Although its portentous historical drama evaporates once you return to the fresh air, watching it can be seductive.\n",
        "A sprawling, ornately constructed entertainment.\n",
        "This premiere of the original cut, running at 312 minutes, leaves room for more than a story of one life.\n",
        "Sumptuous, haunting, and unusually tender... a nakedly psychological 'in' to [Bergman's] earliest artistic impulses; nothing else in his oeuvre addresses so directly his childhood escapes into fantasy as the by-product of a harsh Lutheran upbringing.\n",
        "Our young protagonist will be obsessed with death and see ghosts everywhere. Never has the prison of childhood seemed so inescapable.\n",
        "The result is one of Bergman's most haunting and suggestive films.\n",
        "A sumptuously produced period piece that is also a rich tapestry of childhood memoirs and moods, fear and fancy, employing all the manners and means of the best of cinematic theatrical from high and low comedy to darkest tragedy.\n",
        "It's a marvellously engrossing and thought-provoking film, filled with dazzling dramatic set-pieces and witty, knowing allusions to its creator's artistic conceits and deceits.\n",
        "Utterly enthralling.\n",
        "A fitting introduction to the very personal cinema of this master craftsman, not only because it exhibits Bergman's signature themes and stylistic devices, but also because it is one of his most life-affirming films.\n",
        "[Bergman] glides beyond the mere telling of his story into a kind of hypnotic series of events that have the clarity and fascination of dreams. Rarely have I felt so strongly during a movie that my mind had been shifted into a different kind of reality.\n",
        "It is very much, and in the best way, an old man's movie, the work of an artist resigned to life's mystery, full of wonder at the passage of time, full of forgiveness for past wrongs, and full of understanding.\n",
        "Bergman's 1982 career summation and the kind of rich, timeless, cautionless magnum opus we can only receive, like benedictions, from artists who've paid their generation's dues of sweat, risk, tears, and honesty.\n",
        "A big, dark, beautiful, generous family chronicle, which touches on many of the themes from earlier films while introducing something that, in Bergman, might pass for serenity.\n",
        "A long shaggy dog story.\n",
        "A strange, brooding tale.\n",
        "With a little application and imagination I suppose one might read themes of political and philosophical import into this work, but Cavani's style remains stupidly literal and gaga.\n",
        "Somewhere along the way, the film's handling of serious themes, and its attempts to examine the Nazi legacy in terms of repression and guilt, both sexual and political, get lost amid all the self-conscious decadence.\n",
        "The movie's visual virtues are negated by infinite absurdities -- particularly by the sentimentality with which the director views this luckless couple.\n",
        "The Night Porter is as nasty as it is lubricious, a despicable attempt to titillate us by exploiting memories of persecution and suffering.\n",
        "Few have dared what Brandauer accomplishes: showing us a good actor responding to the same neurotic drive for the center of the stage, the immortalizing role. His is a great performance, nothing less.\n",
        "A disappointingly thin, conventional film.\n",
        "Hungaro pic shows extraordinary period flair for the Germany of the 1920s and '30s, balanced acting by a multinational cast, and exemplary direction.\n",
        "A superbly modulated, fruitfully ambivalent central performance by Brandauer carries the emotional and intellectual weight of the political dilemma.\n",
        "The actor is played by Klaus Maria Brandauer in one of the greatest movie performances I've ever seen.\n",
        "Mephisto seems somewhat remote, without all the urgency of which Mr. Szabo has shown himself capable.\n",
        "It made me feel pity for the actors who worked in it and anger at the director for taking liberties with them.\n",
        "Not quite like any other thriller or erotic mystery you've ever seen.\n",
        "The movie doesn't progress or deepen, it just gets weirder, and to no good end.\n",
        "Director Jeremy Paul Kagan extracts an engaging performance from Meredith Salenger as the heroine.\n",
        "There's a real sense of period, even if the film does occasionally become over-sentimental.\n",
        "As Wolf, a dog named Jed gives a forthright and believable performance. Miss Salenger, for her part, gives one, too, and she carries the movie nicely.\n",
        "It's nice to see a Disney film that follows the rules of the family-film genre as Walt laid them down.\n",
        "Walt Disney has for so long parlayed gooey sentiment and stark horror into profitable cartoons that most moviegoers are apt to be more surprised than disappointed to discover that the combination somehow does not work this time.\n",
        "The wider canvas and extra detail work reportedly meant an additional 30% in negative cost. It was a sound investment.\n",
        "Disney's imagination seems at a low ebb, saddled with a shrunken, excessively naturalistic style in line with the diminished possibilities of postwar animation, and not yet graced by the inspiration that would redeem that style in Sleeping Beauty.\n",
        "Happily the cameo lowlife, an excellent manic beaver, the famously villainous Siamese, and classic songs rescue the film from dumb animal sentiment.\n",
        "The sentimentality is mighty, and the use of the CinemaScope size does not make for any less awareness of the thickness of the goo.\n",
        "The Little Mermaid -- impudent, grandiose, a multilevel crowd-pleaser -- almost returns the Disney animated features to their glory traditions of the '30s and '40s.\n",
        "It may not be a transcendent masterpiece of the Disney canon, but The Little Mermaid is still very heartening: It suggests the Disney magic isn`t lost after all.\n",
        "The latest Disney offering looks back to the studio's unrivaled heritage. It has the look of classic animation. More important, it has the skill required to make it work.\n",
        "In adapting this animated film from Hans Christian Andersen's sad and beautiful fairy tale, writers/directors John Musker and Ron Clements came up with a bright and perky movie.\n",
        "You could wish upon a star and not conjure up a more joyous animated movie than this graceful retelling of the Hans Christian Andersen tale.\n",
        "Within the apparently necessary aesthetic and ideological limitations (such as making the hero and heroine Americans surrounded by foreign servants a la Pinocchio), the animation manages to be fairly energetic.\n",
        "A fantastic success.\n",
        "May represent Disney's best animated feature since the underrated Sleeping Beauty in 1959.\n",
        "This return to traditional Disney territory is geared to captivate children while allowing them to maintain their street cred, largely by combining extravagant animated technique with ranging musical styles.\n",
        "A marvel of skillful animation, witty songwriting and smart planning.\n",
        "Even at its highest points, it cannot claim a place next to even the least of the great Disney classics.\n",
        "A movie that's so creative and so much fun it deserves comparison with the best Disney work of the past.\n",
        "Very lame ice-hockey flick.\n",
        "The film is remarkably oblivious to the fact that if the team weren't hell-bent on a championship, young moviegoers would be significantly less interested in its adventures.\n",
        "It must be said that this movie is sweet and innocent, and that at a certain level it might appeal to younger kids. I doubt if its ambitions reach much beyond that.\n",
        "Those not yet wise to formulaic pablum are likely to enjoy this ice hockey kiddie ensemble comedy. But their older escorts might want to bring a novel and a flashlight, or a Walkman or portable television with earphones.\n",
        "Steven Brill, who has a small role in the film, constructed the screenplay much as one would put together some of those particleboard bookcases from Ikea.\n",
        "The fit between sentiment and satire is not always a comfortable one and the more dedicated fans of either the story or the Muppets may leave theaters dissatisfied.\n",
        "Nothing can really diminish the late Jim Henson's irresistibly appealing characters.\n",
        "This is the dullest and least successful adaptation of the Christmas chestnut I've ever seen.\n",
        "Good fun.\n",
        "There's no great show of wit or tunefulness here, and the ingenious cross-generational touches are fairly rare. But there is a lively kiddie version of the Dickens tale, one that very young viewers ought to understand.\n",
        "Like all the Muppet movies, this one is a musical, with original songs by Paul Williams (my favorite is the early chain-rattling duet by the Marley brothers). It could have done with a few more songs than it has.\n",
        "The Muppet Christmas Carol isn't terrible, by any means. But it's resoundingly moderate, with merely passable songs by Paul Williams, and only occasional real laughter.\n",
        "Neither drama nor comedy, it's safe stuff, and most un-Muppetlike. So much for great expectations.\n",
        "Certain movies engage your affections so strongly that, even if they start to fall apart, you tend to keep rooting for them. That's pretty much the case with Newsies.\n",
        "A Disney musical with an undistinguished score, fair to middling choreography, and clunky direction that still manages to be entertaining in spots because of its story.\n",
        "Bale and Menken are literally what make the movie sing.\n",
        "Despite Newsies' many flaws, it's bracing to see Disney attempt a PG movie about something as meaty as labor relations. Would that every strike be resolved with so little bloodshed and so many songs.\n",
        "Stop the presses! Newsies is the best live-action movie musical since Little Shop of Horrors.\n",
        "An old-fashioned musical that is better when its characters sing and dance than when they talk.\n",
        "Though the cast is large, no interesting or even moderately well-rounded personalities emerge from it, and no compelling relationships emerge between the characters.\n",
        "The movie stands as a textbook demonstration of why they don't -- and probably shouldn't -- make 'em like they used to.\n",
        "The writers have created cardboard cutouts instead of flesh-and-blood characters.\n",
        "It's a bit of a throwback and a solid family film and, at the time, represented a well-intentioned leap of faith of the sort that studios rarely take.\n",
        "If you have a soft spot for feisty, back-talking bambini with cute squints, backwards caps and names like Crutchy, Dutchy and Bumlets, your heart will melt.\n",
        "This film's real trouble lies in its joyless, pointless execution.\n",
        "Although the material does indeed involve young protagonists, no effort is made to show their lives in a way today's kids can identify with. This movie must seem as odd to them as a foreign film.\n",
        "Its intentions seem fairly modest, and so are its achievements. It's a modestly enjoyable diversion.\n",
        "It looks like its own rehearsal -- an early one at that.\n",
        "These ingredients are digitally present and correct, but Hogan fails to inject much excitement into the many boisterous action sequences.\n",
        "A dazzling retelling of the J.M. Barrie tale.\n",
        "With only a few exceptions, the performances (and the script) range between dull and mediocre.\n",
        "In this incarnation, Peter is imbued with a greater degree of psychological darkness than before.\n",
        "Familiarity doesn't exactly breed contempt, yet despite the novelty of a real boy as Peter, the movie does engender a listless been-there / eaten-that reaction.\n",
        "A tribute to the power of good storytelling.\n",
        "Little children may find it a bit scary ... but it's a warmhearted and often magical adventure.\n",
        "If, as you go into the theater, you hear people coming out still chanting 'I do believe in fairies. I do! I do!' do not be alarmed. Soon you will be joining them.\n",
        "Hogan's shimmering vision of Peter Pan is rewardingly sumptuous and faithful.\n",
        "It's not completely joyless, as Spielberg's Hook was. And it is not without its laughs and little pleasures.\n",
        "What it is lacking is any kind of wonder. True fairy dust is in decidedly short supply and without it, the movie sinks like a cannonball.\n",
        "What distinguishes this Peter Pan from other versions is its unsentimental insight into the terrors and delights of both childhood and growing up.\n",
        "Sumptuous-looking and engagingly acted.\n",
        "Both enchantingly old-fashioned and daringly modern.\n",
        "Every generation deserves its own version of Peter Pan. Until the next one arrives in 2019 or so, this one will do nicely.\n",
        "Action-fortified, touching and entertaining from its beguiling beginning to its dreamy conclusion.\n",
        "Has in the young British actress Rachel Hurd-Wood a Wendy for the ages.\n",
        "There just isn't enough in the movie, despite its marvelous design, to warrant another visit to this material.\n",
        "Possesses effects galore, although curiously little to spark the imagination.\n",
        "The plotting of this 1980 feature -- outsider in a hostile environment -- is personal to Altman, though few of the feelings survive the clutter.\n",
        "It is more than faint praise to say that Popeye is far, far better than it might have been, considering the treacherous challenge it presented. But avoiding disaster is not necessarily the same as success.\n",
        "You wonder how on earth Altman did it; equally often, you feel you are watching a wacky masterpiece, the like of which you've never seen before.\n",
        "He takes one of the most artificial and limiting of art forms -- the comic strip -- and raises it to the level of high comedy and high spirits.\n",
        "A thoroughly charming, immensely appealing mess of a movie, often high-spirited and witty, occasionally pretentious and flat, sometimes robustly funny and frequently unintelligible.\n",
        "This sort-of sequel to the 1977 hit The Rescuers boasts reasonably solid production values and fine character voices. Too bad they're set against such a mediocre story that adults may duck.\n",
        "As for the animation, computer technology invests contemporary features with sometimes breathtaking dynamism, but outback flora being what it is, this isn't the most colourful Disney movie.\n",
        "The film's direction, by Hendel Butoy and Mike Gabriel, is spectacularly inventive even when not fully appropriate to either the film's subject or the very young viewers it can be expected to attract.\n",
        "A gorgeously drawn myth made for plucky children and very brave mice.\n",
        "The flight sequence and many of the other action scenes in this new Disney animated feature create an exhilaration and freedom that are liberating. And the rest of the story is fun, too.\n",
        "Carries its ambitions with an easy grace, expanding the art of animation to fresh ground without losing sight of the silly fun we love cartoons for.\n",
        "Four years of work were invested on this $7.5 million production and the expense, care, and expertise shows.\n",
        "The people who really need rescuing are the Disney animators and storymen, who seem uncertain whether to keep up the old studio traditions of cute characters and plush settings, or to branch out into contemporary urban satire.\n",
        "Efficiently short, charming, mildly scary in unimportant ways, and occasionally very funny.\n",
        "The Walt Disney animators returned to top form with this beautifully crafted and wonderfully expressive cartoon feature, the first major work to come out of the Disney studios in a decade.\n",
        "Race to Witch Mountain is the first kids' film in ages to have action beats that measure up to Hollywood's grownup action fare.\n",
        "It's pacy all right, but glib and uninvolving for grown-ups, though perhaps furnished with enough in the way of spaceships, lasers and digital explosions to pacify undemanding little 'uns of an afternoon.\n",
        "The planet-hopping children have special talents -- telekinesis, telepathy etc. -- although it is the high-wattage lovability of Mr. Rock that's the real superpower on display here.\n",
        "These blond space children (Ludwig and Bridge to Terabithia's Robb) are persuasively otherworldly -- and the movie makes room for sympathetic cameos from Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann of the first go-round.\n",
        "There is so much in this film that needed to be tweaked and enhanced to really make it special.\n",
        "I think most kids and certainly most adults are going to find themselves bored.\n",
        "The movie has Johnson, who lifts the script above its conventional cat-and-mouse stratagems with his buoyant wiseacre timing.\n",
        "Wow, when Disney misses the 'reimagining' mark, it really misses.\n",
        "This is not a story that cries out to be remade every 15-20 years. And, while the special effects and acting are getting better, the story isn't.\n",
        "For all that energy, the film never really goes into orbit.\n",
        "Bears all the signs of having been composed by an inferior race of alien screenwriters from the Hackulon System.\n",
        "A fast and furious wild ride of a movie in which the good guys are good, the bad guys are good and the car chases are pretty spectacular.\n",
        "It's a fast, funny, frightening and family-friendly movie, an affectionate tribute to the original, and a vintage thrill ride enhanced by modern visual trickery, crazy characters -- and a soupcon of skepticism.\n",
        "A couple of 10-year-old boys all hopped up on concession-stand soda would be ideal companions for Disney's latest: Race to Witch Mountain.\n",
        "Race to Witch Mountain isn't magic, but it moves.\n",
        "Although Race to Witch Mountain is about space travelers, little soars here. The film is so by-the-book (and we don't mean Key's 1968 novel) that it's hard to recount it without reverting to blahblahblah.\n",
        "Modest and diverting, rough and bland, with some good (if not quite Bette Davis caliber) actors and so-so special effects.\n",
        "Any movie in which a Midwestern prairie actually looks more attractive and more interesting than the enchanted land over the rainbow is in big trouble.\n",
        "It's bleak, creepy, and occasionally terrifying.\n",
        "Despite the presence of Billina the talking hen, the emphasis on insecurity and peril harks back to the treat-'em-rough days of children's fiction, and the disturbing/comforting ratio tilts conclusively towards the former.\n",
        "The work of ingenious technicians who seem either not to know what gave the original film its magic, or not to care.\n",
        "A piece of blandly enthusiastic, B-movie pulp.\n",
        "This $40 million adventure fantasy puts a shiny polish on familiar elements: airborne hero, damsel in distress, Nazi villains, 1930s Hollywood glamor, and dazzling special effects.\n",
        "The whole thing is good-natured enough, but increasingly mechanical.\n",
        "Neat idea, peachy visuals, but there ain't much else to grip the imagination.\n",
        "Plenty of energy has gone into making this a bustling, visually clever film with an amusing late-1930's stylishness, but the purpose of such effort is uncertain.\n",
        "The film is awash in all kinds of surprises that are too juicy to reveal.\n",
        "The Rocketeer may not be perfect, but it's an excellent example of how to adapt a comic book to the screen.\n",
        "You have to dial down, to return to an age of innocence when an eccentric inventor and a clear-eyed hero could take on the bad guys with a new gizmo they'd dreamed up overnight.\n",
        "It's a humble little item, actually, easily digested and easily forgotten.\n",
        "Based on a comic book, deliciously corny but not campy, \"The Rocketeer\" is the movie Dick Tracy and Batman wanted to be.\n",
        "The masterpiece of the Disney Studios' postwar style.\n",
        "The hero and heroine are sugar sculpture, and the witch looks like a clumsy tracing from a Charles Addams cartoon.\n",
        "Mary Costa's rich and expressive voice for the title character gives substance and strength to it.\n",
        "Although this rarely achieves the heights of classics like Snow White and Dumbo, it still has its moments.\n",
        "The colors are rich, the sounds are luscious and magic sparkles spurt charmingly from wands.\n",
        "Possibilities for a dark, child's view fantasy set in rural America of yore are visible throughout the $20 million production but various elements have not entirely congealed into a unified achievement.\n",
        "The plot concerns a mysterious carnival outside a small town in the early 1900s that grants the wishes of the town's citizens, with dark consequences.\n",
        "Ultimately, though, it's an uneasy blend of horror and whimsy, with the allegory being hammered a little too hard for comfort. It's also marred by some dreadfully tacky special effects and set designs.\n",
        "A lively, entertaining tale combining boyishness and grown-up horror in equal measure.\n",
        "This rather mushy combination of animation and live-action remains one of Disney's most controversial efforts.\n",
        "Apparently the Disney wonder-workers are just a lot of conventional hacks when it comes to telling a story with actors instead of cartoons.\n",
        "Better save this for nostalgia only -- kids won't be missing anything if they never encounter this relic.\n",
        "A romantic comedy that is as salty and bracing as a plunge in the surf.\n",
        "Although film is a bit uneven, production benefits from a tasty look, an airy tone, and a delectable, unblemished performance from Hannah.\n",
        "Howard demonstrates exactly the correct soft touch, skirting the myriad problems of taste.\n",
        "It's too bad the relentlessly conventional minds that made this movie couldn't have made the leap from sitcom to comedy.\n",
        "Splash may feature a heroine with fins, but it's mostly a standard love story, albeit one with some delightful new twists.\n",
        "Its appeal is based almost entirely on regression -- a thematic regression to infancy and a stylistic regression to the most lulling kind of TV blandness.\n",
        "For most people, TRON's importance is as a historical footnote. It's the Model T of our CGI age. But the film's fans are passionate ones.\n",
        "It's a simple idea that ought to serve, but Lisberger's failures of pacing, structure, variation, and characterization ultimately make the film seem monotonous and distant.\n",
        "Tron is loaded with visual delights but falls way short of the mark in story and viewer involvement.\n",
        "Tron never reaches a level of excitement commensurate with its effects budget.\n",
        "A dazzling movie from Walt Disney in which computers have been used to make themselves romantic and glamorous. Here's a technological sound-and-light show that is sensational and brainy, stylish, and fun.\n",
        "Its computer sequences exist in a blue-gray scheme filled with flashing lights, speeding objects and dizzying motion. Its visual effects are wonderfully new. They are also numbing after a while.\n",
        "While Carpenter's film was all about economy and a skilful use of empty space, Miner's busy compositions have a cluttered feel that is echoed by superfluous orchestral music.\n",
        "I'm currently stuck watching the revival of a movie form that appalled me the first time around, then disappeared from view after a torrent of thoughtless re-workings that resembled bloody tape loops.\n",
        "...Steve Miner is no Carpenter.\n",
        "Halloween: H20 is as stylish and scary as it is ultra-violent. It brings back a stunning Jamie Lee Curtis in the role that made her a star and it's a work of superior craftsmanship in all aspects.\n",
        "Now that they have produced something vaguely enjoyable, hopefully the film makers will let the series rest in peace.\n",
        "The scary slasher-movie genre has been ratcheted up several notches with the release today of Halloween: H20.\n",
        "I imagined Miss Leigh telling her friends, 'They wanted me to do a cameo in the remake of Psycho, but I said, hell, I'd do Halloween: H20 before I'd lower myself to that.'\n",
        "...the throwaway jokes are few and far between, and after a pre-title sequence reintroduces Michael and shows just how far up suspense and thrills can be ratcheted, Halloween H20 declines into the routine.\n",
        "...the film is as predictable as all the other slasher flicks that followed Halloween.\n",
        "This is a very personal Martin project -- the sweet-souled, nonstop-funny testament of a native Angeleno. Sly and soulful, it's the comedy that dares to be dippy.\n",
        "Goofy and sweet, L.A. Story constitutes Steve Martin's satiric valentine to his hometown and a pretty funny comedy in the bargain.\n",
        "Steve Martin's script, a delightfully scatty account of life in the city of angels, exposes romance lurking beyond the snobbish restaurants and routine muggings...\n",
        "Like Mr. Martin himself, L.A. Story seems basically decent, intelligent and sweet. It's a fanciful romantic comedy whose wildest and craziest notion is that Los Angeles, for all of its eccentricities, is a great place to live.\n",
        "To borrow from Abe Lincoln: Steve Martin's L.A. Story will make all of the people laugh some of the time, some of the people laugh all of the time but not...well, you know the rest.\n",
        "If the material had been presented more insistently, it might have been insufferable, too goopy and new-age. Its modesty, though, is its prime virtue. It's breezy and light as cloud's breath -- not so much airheaded as air-hearted.\n",
        "Steve Martin shows again in this film that he has found the right comic presence for the movies; the lack of subtlety in early films like The Jerk has now been replaced by a smoothness and unforced intelligence.\n",
        "Its humor is successful and unsuccessful by turns, and although Comedian Carl Reiner is the director, the instinct here is to give most of both credit and blame to Martin.\n",
        "An artless, non-stop barrage of off-the-wall situations, funny and unfunny jokes, generally effective and sometimes hilarious sight gags and bawdy non sequiturs.\n",
        "The comedy runs out of steam when the jerk makes good, but laugh for laugh it's probably a better investment than 10.\n",
        "We get the sense at times that the cast and crew arrived at a location, found the script bankrupt of real laughs, and started looking around for funny props.\n",
        "The laughs aren't steady, but they're persistent, and the film moves fast enough to compensate for its unevenness.\n",
        "This is the sound of a filmmaker wrestling (transparently) with ideas, talking at but not quite down to his audience.\n",
        "[An] earnest, often moving but not totally successful film.\n",
        "If this disaster-packed parable often smacks of melodramatic contrivance, it does at least benefit from solid performances and direction, and a leavening line in sardonic humour.\n",
        "For long stretches of this offbeat and innovative film, the viewer truly has no idea what will happen next and many reasons to care.\n",
        "Even when he wasn't trying, Kasdan's camera found tragedy, as with the opening footage of Magic Johnson, filmed before anybody knew he had the AIDS virus. The filmmaker and his team have truly caught society on the verge.\n",
        "It maps these dark, desperate, fearful times with comic and terrifying veracity, and holds out a glimmer of hope for the soul-searching survivors of the '90s.\n",
        "Because it falls in with the undulating rhythm of the life of its heroes, for whom a fatal fight and a quiet night have almost equal importance, the picture never manages to reach the peaks of satisfying Hollywood melodrama.\n",
        "Well acted and crafted but highly conventional.\n",
        "The film is unremitting in its morbid sentimentality, running its teenage characters through a masochistic gamut of beatings, killings, burnings, and suicides.\n",
        "Lightly likeable.\n",
        "A deeply strange film that gives '60s hoodlums the personalities of Care Bears and places them under constant attack from preppies in pastel sweaters.\n",
        "[Coppola's] revisions to the film, which include a new, improved soundtrack, invest it with grandeur worthy of both its characters and his own ambitions.\n",
        "Francis Coppola's revision of his 1983 film of S.E. Hinton's best seller The Outsiders is funny, touching and revelatory.\n",
        "There's not much life in this movie, or spontaneity. It's a stylistic exercise.\n",
        "Again you will savor the Indiana Jones schizophrenia: by day a bow-tied, bespectacled archaeologist; by night a resourceful swaggerer, whom Ford brings to life as a modern blend of Bogie and the Duke, with just a glint of misfit psychopathy in his eyes.\n",
        "It's not the darker turn that makes The Temple of Doom uncomfortable at times; it's its mean-spiritedness.\n",
        "Pic comes on like a sledgehammer, and there's even a taste of vulgarity and senseless excess not apparent in Raiders.\n",
        "The film betrays no human impulse higher than that of a ten-year-old boy trying to gross out his baby sister by dangling a dead worm in her face.\n",
        "Set years before the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is sillier, darkly violent and a bit dumbed down, but still great fun.\n",
        "Part of the trouble is that anything clearly does go, including the slender hold on credibility that Raiders managed to maintain.\n",
        "The kind of movie where your date is always grabbing your forearm in a viselike grip, as unbearable excitement unfolds on the screen. After the movie is over, you've had a great time but your arm is black-and-blue for a week.\n",
        "Too shapeless to be the fun that Raiders is, but shape may be beside the point. Old- time, 15-part movie serials didn't have shape. The just went on and on and on, which is what Indiana Jones does with humor and technical invention.\n",
        "With The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Peter Jackson delivers a decent ending to his fantasy trilogy -- actually, about 12 endings.\n",
        "Yes, the running time is long, and yes, those many endings in a slow, dreamy coda left me feeling spent -- better spent than I can ever remember.\n",
        "Standing out amid an excellent cast is Elijah Wood, stymied by tweeness in the earlier films but here convincingly developing the character of Frodo as the embodiment of valor and self-sacrifice.\n",
        "Some story strands are crudely abbreviated; others fail to develop elements that were already well-established.\n",
        "Pops your eyes, excites your senses and brings you in as close as a whisper for scenes of startling emotion.\n",
        "As I watched this film, an eager victim of its boundless will to astound, I found my loyal memories of the book beginning to fade.\n",
        "Not only has Jackson boldly and faithfully brought J.R.R. Tolkien's world to life, he's created the most epic and sweeping fantasy adventure of all time.\n",
        "Both the longest film in the series and the most confidently paced, striking an ideal balance of combat and camaraderie.\n",
        "Completes the picture, magnificently so, and all honour and praise are due the visionaries behind the project.\n",
        "The thrilling conclusion to what has become the film event of our time -- the definitive screen fantasy -- features more spellbinding moments, bigger battles, more emotion and more poetry than the terrific first two films in the trilogy.\n",
        "A movie for our time, perhaps for all time, mostly a good time and definitely a long time.\n",
        "It reminds you of the power of film like no other movie in memory.\n",
        "I went along with the first and admired the second, but it wasn't until the third that I was swept away by the magnitude of Jackson's vision.\n",
        "Confirms Jackson's reputation as a kinetic director who has made author J.R.R. Tolkien's work his own -- not as plagiarist but as a visionary.\n",
        "Return of the King is such a crowning achievement, such a visionary use of all the tools of special effects, such a pure spectacle, that it can be enjoyed even by those who have not seen the first two films.\n",
        "The final chapter completes The Lord of the Rings series in thrilling style -- and restores faith in the idea that popular entertainment can soar to majestic heights.\n",
        "The film event of the millennium.\n",
        "This is the best of the three Rings movies -- more than that, it makes the others look even better.\n",
        "Not only a thrilling experience, it closes the book on a truly satisfying trilogy.\n",
        "Tolkien and his representative on Earth, [Peter] Jackson, really know how to get a tale roaring down the tracks.\n",
        "They're creepy and they're predictable? Mysterious and rather tame?\n",
        "Ooky the Addamses may be, subversive they ain't; it plays like a paean to the nuclear family.\n",
        "An extended collection of one-liners and not much more.\n",
        "Despite inspired casting and nifty visual trappings, the eagerly awaited Addams Family figures as a major disappointment.\n",
        "Ooky the Addamses may be, subversive they ain't; it plays like a paean to the nuclear family.\n",
        "The film's aimlessness and repetitiveness eventually become draining.\n",
        "An otherwise very funny scene featuring Thing amounts to an extended ad for Federal Express, and the rap beats from Hammer's new album boom from passing cars in several scenes -- nothing will date this movie faster.\n",
        "There are a lot of little smiles in The Addams Family, and many chuckles and grins, but they don't add up to much.\n",
        "More than merely a sequel of the TV series, the film is a compendium of paterfamilias Charles Addams's macabre drawings, a resurrection of the cartoonist's body of work. For family friends, it would seem a viewing is de rigueur mortis.\n",
        "Drew Barrymore plays the complicated belle of the climactic ball and develops a convincing intellectually based friendship with the prince.\n",
        "The script by Susannah Grant, Rick Parks and director Andy Tennant successfully maintains the story's period trappings while introducing a heroine with modern resonance.\n",
        "Given that this is adolescent romance, never straying far from traditional stereotypes, its 'progressive' feel-good aura is mainly down to Barrymore, whose limitations are only exposed in big love scenes."

        "Too much talk, not enough wooing. In the end, Ever After's spell is only half cast.\n",
        "The old tale still has life and passion in it.\n",
        "Veering wildly between farce and suds, the movie never makes up its mind whether it's a spoof, a soap opera or a feminist pep talk.\n",
        "The best Cinderella movie ever.\n",
        "A Cinderella without mice as coachmen, in other words, had better have a mighty fine excuse for tampering with a successful formula. Against many odds, Ever After comes up with a good one.\n",
        "This Cinderella is undeniably magical.\n",
        "It may be fluff, but this movie works.\n",
        "Ever After is a droll, uneven treatment of a familiar story that could become as popular with children as the 1950 Disney cartoon version.\n",
        "Barrymore has the sort of charm that can make you cockeyed with happiness.\n",
        "Too bad Barrymore's charming personality goes to waste in Ever After, a reworking of Cinderella with muddled motives and uneven execution.\n",
        "Sure to be a hit with almost everyone who sees it.\n",
        "Handsomely set in 15th-century France, it gracefully folds in all sorts of 20th-century values.\n",
        "Wispy threads of dramatic plausibility and character involvement unravel completely by the time of the incredibly silly final reel.\n",
        "Never loses its bearings as it hovers between preposterous paranoia and a Billy-Wilder-like moral fable about a deeply flawed hero who draws a line in the sand beyond which he cannot go.\n",
        "The film echoes the technical wizardry and complex plotting of De Palma's best film, Blow Out.\n",
        "Director Brian De Palma does his stylish best to weave the patchy script into a cinematic quilt, but despite his best efforts -- and they're often formidable -- the thing just doesn't cohere.\n",
        "What might have been fascinating after a while becomes frustrating and, finally, a real slog.\n",
        "Although De Palma doesn't always stick rigorously to each separate viewpoint, there's an undeniable finesse in the way he parcels out the exposition in increments...\n",
        "You're never asked to invest much in the characters, and by the time you've roused yourself to care, it's too late.\n",
        "It's the worst kind of bad film: the kind that gets you all worked up and then lets you down, instead of just being lousy from the first shot.\n",
        "[De Palma's] most flamboyant fantasy of high-flying conspiracy and corruption since Blow Out.\n",
        "De Palma doesn't know the meaning of the word \"subtle\" -- every scene in Snake Eyes uses a brash, in-your-face approach that works until the disappointing climax.\n",
        "The last five to 10 minutes are completely stupid and add nothing to the film.\n",
        "I can't think of another movie that starts so brilliantly and ends so miserably as this one.\n",
        "[Sarandon is] shirtless before she even has a name, but her desire to be ogled is granted dignity and power; gradually and unassumingly, she upstages a terrific Burt Lancaster.\n",
        "A shimmering success.\n",
        "\"Atlantic City\" is a sophisticated fairy tale, beautifully acted and beautiful to behold; it is as funny as it is touching.\n",
        "Film is blessed with a spare, intriguing script by Yank John Guare, which always skirts impending cliches and predictability by finding unusual facets in his characters and their actions.\n",
        "Eclectic, pacy and hard to categorise, it's part crime thriller, part love story, part fairytale, and part a gentle, generous examination of certain dying aspects of American culture.\n",
        "What makes \"Atlantic City\" sweet -- and that's the word for it -- is the gentleness with which Lou handles his last chance at amounting to something, and the wisdom with which Sally handles Lou.\n",
        "[It] may be one of the most romantic and perverse ghost stories ever filmed, set not in a haunted castle but in a haunted city...\n",
        "The movie makes good chamber music: it's a crafted miniature with Bergman's usual bombast built, for once, into the plot requirements.\n",
        "Of course Bergman's actresses suffer superbly in microscopic close-up, but the nagging doubt persists as to whether this is incisive psychodrama or just those old nordic blues again.\n",
        "When Nichols finally settles down, it's almost too late.\n",
        "Edward Albee's vitriolic stage portrayal of domestic blisslessness translated grainily and effectively to the screen.\n",
        "And in its forthright dealing with the play, this becomes one of the most scathingly honest American films ever made.\n",
        "Keen adaptation and handsome production by Ernest Lehman, outstanding direction by Mike Nichols in his feature debut, and four topflight performances score an artistic bullseye.\n",
        "'You have ugly talents,' George says, almost admiringly, to Martha. So does this movie.\n",

        "By the end of the film, I'd had a couple of real laughs and a few interesting moments, but that was about all.\n",
        "Weird Science veers off into a typical coming-of-age saga without exploring any of the psychological territory it lightly sails over in the early going.\n",
        "This is ordinary stuff that's aged about as well as Mitchell-Smith's clunky computer.\n",
        "Even 14-year-old boys may find it heavy sledding.\n",
        "Weird Science combines two great traditions in popular entertainment: Inflamed male teenage fantasies and Frankenstein's monster.\n",
        "Youngsters will warm to the barn's talking animals and perhaps even shed a tear at the sight of a spider shuffling off the mortal coil. Arachnaphobes, though, are advised to approach with caution.\n",
        "Any tears you may shed will be wholly earned.\n",
        "I think what's most valuable here is the gentle reminder that lives are short, friendship is priceless and words can make a difference. The movie Charlotte's Web isn't a classic, but the message is.\n",
        "Woe be to the child who doesn't mist up at this movie, since it's been made if not with zip, wit, or imagination, then at least with sweetness. But I hope no one will think the film is an adequate replacement for White's book. That would be a crime.\n",
        "There's too much talent and too strong a story to mess it up. There was potential for more here, but this incarnation is nothing to be ashamed of, and some of the actors answer the bell.\n",
        "Charlotte's Web has all the requisite elements that a family film needs to succeed and endure: humor, drama, pathos, and an emotionally satisfying ending.\n",
        "Best of all may be the narration, by Sam Shepard: His voice, the kind of voice God might have if he'd ever smoked Camels, frames this gentle but potent little story with good-natured authority, making it feel modern and ageless at once.\n",
        "Charlotte's Web, with its insistently 'magical' theme music, an overbearing climax and a trough full of bad jokes, is merely adequate.\n",
        "It's a movie so modest and gentle, you'll hear your neighbour's popcorn crunch. But you may also hear your heart beating. And there's nothing wrong with that.\n",
        "The film, directed by Gary Winick (13 Going on 30) has a sweetness of its own.\n",
        "Charlotte's Web, a splendid new screen adaptation of White's 1952 children's book, gloriously brings the classic to life. If you've never read it, this is a perfect introduction.\n",
        "The movie may not be perfect, but it beautifully distills White's simple message. We are all born to die. But we are also born to befriend.\n",
        "\"Some pig?\" Sure. Some spider. And some book. Some movie, too.\n",
        "Unfortunately, Charlotte's Web is an unremarkable collection of cute kids, talking animals and syrupy sentiment. There's little of White's original spare style and even less to entertain anyone but the very undemanding.\n",
        "Like its porcine protagonist, E.B. White's classic 1952 story Charlotte's Web manages to be both radiant and humble. If only the same could be said for Gary Winick's live-action adaptation, which is neither.\n",
        "Fanning isn't quite right. No doubt the ubiquitous young lady is the first child actor anyone pictures as Fern, but is there ever a moment in which the audience isn't aware they're watching Dakota Fanning in the part?\n",
        "The ads promise magic, but apart from the requisite heart-tugging finale, what it delivers is uneventful.\n",
        "Charlotte's Web adapts a classic, which is not to say it is one.\n",
        "A rare movie that keeps kids on the edge of their chairs without inducing in their parents an overwhelming desire to escape theirs for a smoke in the lobby.\n",
        "A brief spark of imagination survives in a prologue sequence, designed by the great John Hubley before he was fired from the film. The rest is blandness.\n",
        "The 'camera' takes a conventionally objective viewpoint, perpetually rolling over rolling countryside, which effectively robs the plot of all its terror and tension.\n",
        "Bluth and his animators, bless them, chose to revive an endangered art form -- classically detailed animation. They drew their characters exquisitely and gave them individual personalities.\n",
        "Not enthralling, but worth seeing for anyone interested in the mechanics of this arcane art.\n",
        "Every character moves fluidly and imaginatively against an extravaganza of detailed background and dazzling effects, all emboldened by fascinating colored textures.\n",
        "It is something gorgeous to look at.\n",
        "It's a spectacular return to the shimmering, mesmerising deep-focus animation associated with Disney's classic period...\n",
        "It looks good, moves well, and delights our eyes.\n",
        "The story manages to be sentimental without being especially moving.\n",
        "You have to love a fantasy whose greatest peril is the Bog of Eternal Stench.\n",
        "The screenplay by David Odell, based on a story by Mr. Henson, is without any narrative drive whatever. It's without charm as well as interest.\n",
        "Cartoons with ambitions even this noble are as rare as Steven Spielberg films that lose money, but every character and every situation presented herein have been seen a thousand times before.\n",
        "The overall quality of the animation -- baroquely executed if rather conventionally conceived -- makes it worth a look\n",
        "For all its state-of-the-art animation techniques, Spielberg's production remains resolutely conservative: visually it's virtually indistinguishable from Walt at his wimpiest.\n",
        "Witless if well-meaning.\n",
        "It may be that the truly American tale here is the spectacle of an artist squandering his awesome gifts on the way to becoming a Hollywood institution.\n",
        "he movie has such vague ethnic grounds, however, that only a few children will understand or care that the Mousekewitzes are Jewish. And few of those are likely to be entertained by such a tragic, gloomy story.\n",
        "A bright-eyed tale of Jewish triumphs that will find a place in many young hearts.\n",
        "All of the special effects in the world, and all of the great makeup, and all of the great Muppet creatures can't save a movie that has no clear idea of its own mission and no joy in its own accomplishment.\n",
        "There's also a darkly handsome high school heartbreak kid (Michael Schoeffling), a merciful brisk pace, some quick humor (visual and verbal), and a solid music track.\n",
        "As the girl, Molly Ringwald is natural and appealing, but she's lost in a world of blunt, vicious caricatures.\n",
        "Sly humour and an appreciative ear for the demotic improv of teenage chat completes an attractive package.\n",
        "A sweet and funny movie about two of the worst things that can happen to a girl on her sixteenth birthday.\n",
        "Most of the the movie is cheerful and light, showcasing Mr. Hughes's knack for remembering all those aspects of middle-class American adolescent behavior that anyone else might want to forget.\n",
        "Some of the material works marvelously well, but the stuff that doesn't takes the movie down with it.\n",
        "Pretty in Pink is a rather intelligent (if not terribly original) look at adolescent insecurities.\n",
        "This is like every other Hughes film, just a little shoddier.\n",
        "To be able to give this kind of stuff new and sympathetic twists is a tribute to Hughes' skill with narrative, and to Ringwald's magnetism as a performer.\n",
        "Miss Ringwald's pouty naturalness remains her biggest asset, and her performance is once again appealing.\n",
        "Although it is not a great movie, it contains some moments when the audience is likely to think, yes, being 16 was exactly like that.\n",
        "This is Reader's Digest prehistory, though at least director Chapman (cameraman on Raging Bull) makes sure the murky caves look nice.\n",
        "The filmmakers made no effort to empathize with their prehistoric characters, to imagine what it might have really been like back then.\n",
        "The original film's director, Charles Martin Smith... has been replaced by Richard Martin, who brings a family-hour blandness to every scene.\n",
        "[The film is] marked by dumbfoundingly bad dialogue, cliche-driven plotting and groan-worthy predictability.\n",
        "As sequels go, Air Bud: Golden Receiver is barking up the wrong tree.\n",
        "The film is pleasantly sweet and occasionally sharp.\n",
        "Though the movie is inept in a number of key ways, what it really lacks is a lead actor who can carry his scenes with an un-doggish panache.\n",
        "It's a Styrofoam-cup comedy, lightweight and disposable, but this G-rated fantasy of suburban family life is a good bet for its intended audience of 12-year-olds and younger.\n",
        "Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver is a pale shadow of the entertaining 1997 family movie. It's a sequel that lacks the spirit and sweetness of the original.\n",
        "The movie meanders on and on, like a bad sexual dream, until you finally wake up mumbling: Stella, please: leave that groove thang alone.\n",
        "Delivers guilt-free escapism about pretty people having wicked-hot fun in pretty places.\n",
        "Stella may be frothy and paper-thin, but it's also another great success for star Angela Bassett, who transforms the film into an infomercial for her considerable abilities.\n",
        "I never felt Stella and Winston were on the same wavelength, that they could share their lives, that it would be a good idea for them to try.\n",
        "Consider this the big-screen equivalent of a beach read: Just turn off your brain and wallow in whatever turn-ons -- Whoopi and whoopee -- Stella offers.\n",
        "All formula gloss, a romance that tackles some difficult issues by missing them altogether.\n",
        "Ms. Bassett portrays this high-strung superwoman with such intensity that she makes her almost believable.\n",
        "Women of all ages and races will undoubtedly cheer Stella on as she wrestles with the dilemma of falling in love with a younger man, and by doing so, gets her groove back ... baby.\n",
        "The issues that arise from such a May/September male/female pairing are sensitively and intelligently explored.\n",
        "I'm not denying that a 40-year- old woman might be self-conscious about going around with someone this young. But the subject isn't interesting or provocative enough to sustain an entire movie.\n",
        "Funny, well acted comedy from a new director whose career shuld be watched\n",
        "Though hypocritical in the way it sensationalizes sexuality, this serious and funny 1998 movie about a 15-year-old coming to terms with her body and her family in 1976 is, refreshingly, never coy or ironic.\n",
        "A small film with plenty of incidental pleasures, writer/director Jenkins' debut feature puts a winning new spin on the adolescent comedy-drama.\n",
        "There's an alchemy that can transform personal experience into a great film, but it was nowhere nearby when Tamara Jenkins wrote and directed this lacklustre first feature.\n",
        "What lifts this brash comedy above the vulgar herd is Tamara Jenkins in a heartfelt feature debut as writer and director.\n",
        "Generally Jenkins shows few rookie jitters, and she got excellent performances from the rest of her cast.\n",
        "Dark, bitingly funny!\n",
        "Coming-of-age films don't get any warmer, funnier, raunchier, or more endearing than Tamara Jenkins's brightly feisty memoir, 'Slums of Beverly Hills'.\n",
        "The character's struggles with the pitfalls of adolescent development may be particular to women, but many of the emotional ramifications will strike a chord of familiarity for men, as well.\n",
        "The best-written comedy I've seen since The Opposite of Sex.\n",
        "All of [the cast members], especially Ms. Lyonne and Mr. Arkin, project a crazy sincerity that turns this personal and nostalgic comedy into a very true story indeed.\n",
        "A hilarious comedy that never strains to be funny.\n",
        "Basically I enjoyed Slums of Beverly Hills -- for the wisecracking, for the family squabbles, for the notion of squatters who stake a claim in a Beverly Hills where money, after all, is not the only currency.\n",
        "This honorable follow-up to LaBute's stunning debut, In the Company of Men, which also dissects sexual politics, is well acted by the entire ensemble.\n",
        "It is superbly executed and, for all its pitilessness, it's an intelligent dramatization of the impact that consumerist values have had on the psyche of the North American middle class at the end of the 20th century.\n",
        "With LaBute, you get a filmmaker who cuts to the timeless heart of sexual warfare.\n",
        "It's refreshing to see a movie like this -- something that's edgy and entertaining, and doesn't try to appeal to 'the masses.'\n",
        "Bleak, scathing, and utterly compelling!\n",
        "Hilarious!\n",
        "Confuses a kind of juvenile titillation with insight and treats the ability to make audiences squirm as a pinnacle of film art.\n",
        "LaBute's Your Friends and Neighbors is to In the Company of Men as Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction was to Reservoir Dogs.\n",
        "A fascinatingly mean-spirited erotic comedy set in a realm of self-absorbed fantasy and overdetermined intergender misunderstanding.\n",
        "Stay away!\n",
        "The entire thing, from beginning to end, can be boiled down into a three word sentence: 'I hate people.'\n",
        "LaBute's characters are just cold, pretty figures striking art film poses while spouting corrosive but predictably theatrical dialogues.\n",
        "Irresistibly entertaining!\n",
        "The web of lies, failures and brutal revelations here is strong stuff, and it's the work of an original filmmaker who takes no prisoners.\n",
        "Full of empty provocation!\n",
        "Hopelessly dated before its release.\n",
        "Though slick and diverting in some aspects, increasingly silly pic has trouble meshing disparate elements -- horror, superhero fantasy, straight-up action -- into a workable whole.\n",
        "An attempt to redefine cutting edge horror, this techno-vampire pic is spoiled by the same weak storytelling and flashy, computer game visuals.\n",
        "There are lots of stunts, chase sequences and so much computer morphing that the effects house must have been offering it at discount.\n",
        "Lots of exploding heads and oceans of blood, moves fast and with no discernible meaning but looks good.\n",
        "My question is, if audiences are trying so desperately to escape whatever's got them all worked up in their daily lives, how is this any better?\n",
        "The sort of glittering trash pile that makes you dread the words comic-book movie.\n",
        "Big as it is, Blade is meticulous and subtle, not just in its camera technique but in the way it works its themes and creates a mood.\n",
        "A cartoonish futuristic action-adventure yarn.\n",
        "Goyer's script predicably alternates from scenes of Snipes brooding and Snipes kicking vampire butt.\n",
        "Blade is one of those all-style, no-substance goth-mix adaptations that looks like The Crow, sounds like Spawn, and feels like Dark City.\n",
        "A two-hour collection of jokes, stunts, chases and bloodlettings in search of a story or at least one compelling character.\n",
        "Blade has the capacity to dazzle, but it also will leave many viewers dissatisfied.\n",
        "Pure visceral imagery.\n",
        "Eventually, Blade loses its edge.\n",
        "The fight scenes -- particularly Blade's first appearance -- are undeniably exciting.\n",
        "A dull Blade indeed!\n",
        "A pulsing, wooshing, visceral experience that amounts to great fun and an entirely disposable movie.\n",
        "Sultry, silly story!\n",
        "The real creative opportunities lie in visual and choreographic options, and Haines doesn't miss a beat in either department.\n",
        "The use of Plowright as a middle-aged frump wanting to get in on the sexy action is deeply patronizing.\n",
        "What is it about dance, that most joyous of arts, that inspires so many bad movies?\n",
        "Although the movie bubbles occasionally, it never boils.\n",
        "Throughout the film, Haines treats...banal moments as epiphanies, telegraphing every feeling and thought with annoying coyness.\n",
        "Although Dance With Me disappoints on almost every level, it still leaves you mildly elated...\n",
        "This film's storyline couldn't be more pedestrian if it tried.\n",
        "As far as feel-good movies go, this one works in spite of a bloated running length (over two hours) and a plot that could use an injection of originality.\n",
        "The movie sees Ruby, the Williams character, clearly and with surprising truthfulness; she has a depth associated with more serious movies.\n",
        "Promises to be one of the summer's best date movies.\n",
        "The best gags pop up in the closing credits, which should tell you something about what precedes the finale.\n",
        "Even the audience at the free promotional screening was hard-pressed to find many genuine laughs in this purportedly comic abomination.\n",
        "Beyond stupid.\n",
        "A mind- numbingly awful motion picture that has a better chance of making a viewer physically ill than of provoking a genuine laugh.\n",
        "Unfortunately, most of the jokes just aren't very funny.\n",
        "Next Stop, Wonderland isn't really much more than a beautifully acted, finely edited sitcom, but it creates and sustains an intelligent, seriocomic mood better than any recent film about the urban single life.\n",
        "A soulful, thoughtful comedy!\n",
        "A sweetly seductive romantic comedy!\n",
        "There's not much to stop for in Wonderland.\n",
        "Predictable!\n",
        "Beetlejuice means something good: that imaginative artists can bring a fading genre back from the dead.\n",
        "Luckily, Keaton pops up from his grave to liven things up when the antics pitting the good ghosts against the intruders become a trite cat & mouse game.\n",
        "Some of the most surprisingly enjoyable viewing in years.\n",
        "An appealing mess.\n",
        "[The] actors, not surprisingly, are limited by the stupidity of their material.\n",
        "Not since Ghostbusters have the spirits been so uplifting.\n",
        "The joy of Beetlejuice is its completely bizarre -- but perfectly realized -- view of the world.\n",
        "The movie is all anticlimax once we realize it's going to be about gimmicks, not characters.\n",
        "Take away a couple of neatly staged action sequences and you're left with a callously measured slab of US jingoism that deals with the most horrific human tragedies in the most lunk-headed and insulting way possible.\n",
        "I felt cheated.\n",
        "Nobody looks cooler walking in slow motion through a crime scene while wearing sunglasses than Denzel Washington -- but even the great Denzel can't save Deja Vu.\n",
        "The fleetingly satisfying Deja Vu is ultimately a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n",
        "Pretty dazzling, as action adventures go, even when it's wildly, almost defiantly, implausible.\n",
        "The movie manages the singular feat of placing a science-fiction premise in a realistic setting, only to render that premise even more far-fetched than it would have seemed otherwise.\n",
        "What gives the film its jolt of urgency is its New Orleans setting. Deja Vu is the first major movie to be shot there since the city's devastation.\n",
        "Deja Vu isn't as sleek a genre pleasure as Enemy of the State, but it does have a freaky little trick up its sleeve.\n",
        "Deja Vu attempts to explain the 'science' behind the movie's time-jumping, but in a drama that's contemporary and supposedly realistic, it comes off as cockamamie.\n",
        "The movie's saved by an appealing star, a swift pace and a vivid setting.\n",
        "[A] needlessly complicated and confusing thriller.\n",
        "Deja Vu is well worth seeing for its visual brio, particularly the boom-crash opera of the ferry explosion, and a chase scene in which Washington is dodging downtown traffic on two temporal planes simultaneously.\n",
        "Washington and Scott manage to make Deja Vu perfectly watchable, no matter how many times we've seen this before.\n",
        "Deja Vu starts out a lot like an expensive-looking episode of CSI before morphing into a solidly entertaining time-traveling romance.\n",
        "Ed Wood, notorious as the worst film director in history, could have made the $80 million Jerry Bruckheimer time-travel thriller Deja Vu for about $99.95 and it would have been just as believable.\n",

        "A quirk-filled, paranoid, blood-and-sweat thriller that offers perfect pulse-racing escape for a holiday weekend.\n",
        "DejA Vu is so cleverly thought out and is conceived, directed and acted that the leaps in both logic and scientific theory are more fun to make than they are to ponder.\n",
        "Apart from the tedium of waiting or someone to open that chest and discover the hidden body which the hosts have tucked away for the sake of a thrill, the unpunctuated flow of image becomes quite monotonous.\n",
        "Rope is not merely a stunt that is justified by the extraordinary career that contains it, but one of the movies that makes that career extraordinary.\n",
        "A rolling boil of sex and violence beneath the bland surfaces of suburban placidity.\n",
        "Hitchcock has a deviously complicated tale to tell, and he's going to tell it with labyrinthine detail, and he's not going to cheat.\n",
        "A witty, relaxed lark.\n",
        "This is the kind of thriller Hitchcock was making in the 1940s, filled with macabre details, incongruous humor, and the desperation of a man convicted of a crime he didn't commit.\n",
        "You can never be quite sure when you're going to start a terrifying new descent or take a sudden turn to the left or right. The agony is exquisite.\n",
        "Topaz is not only most entertaining. It is, like so many Hitchcock films, a cautionary fable by one of the most moral cynics of our time.\n",
        "Alfred Hitchcock's 1966 spy thriller has one of the lowest reputations of his late works. Coming after a masterpiece like Marnie, it almost had to be a disappointment. But Hitchcock was incapable of making an uninteresting film.\n",
        "Hitchcock freshens up his bag of tricks in a good potpourri which becomes a bit stale through a noticeable lack of zip and pacing.\n",
        "An above-average quota of glaringly shaky process work; but at least one classic sequence of protracted violence in a farmhouse kitchen.\n",
        "In these times, with James Bonds cutting capers and pallid spies coming in out of the cold, Mr. Hitchcock will have to give us something a good bit brighter to keep us amused.\n",
        "Universally despised on its first release, Marnie remains one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest and darkest achievements.\n",
        "Marnie is the character study of a thief and a liar, but what makes her tick remains clouded even after a climax reckoned to be shocking but somewhat missing its point.\n",
        "It's still thrilling to watch, lush, cool and oddly moving.\n",
        "At once a fascinating study of a sexual relationship and the master's most disappointing film in years.\n",
        "Frighteningly authentic, the story generates only a modicum of drama.\n",
        "The film is uncharacteristically rigid and pious for Hitchcock; it feels more like a work of duty than conviction.\n",
        "While drawing the footage out a bit long, he still keeps suspense working at all times and gets strong performances from the two stars and other cast members.\n",
        "Starting slowly amid colourful but rather superfluous travelogue-style Moroccan footage, the film improves no end as it progresses.\n",
        "Even in mammoth VistaVision, the old Hitchcock thriller-stuff has punch.\n",
        "This latest of Mr. Hitchcock's efforts is a curiously whimsical thing.\n",
        "The movie is more interesting than achieved: it's the most forthright statement of the transference theme in Hitchcock's work, but it's also the least nuanced.\n",
        "While Hitchcock short-changes on the expected round of suspense for which he is noted, he does bring out a number of topflight performances and gives the picture an interesting polish that is documentary at times.\n",
        "A good, workmanlike thriller, I Confess is only fair-to-middling Hitchcock.\n",
        "Alfred Hitchcock's famous talent for brewing a mood of fine suspense with clever direction and cutting is spent on a nigh suspenseless script.\n",
        "It's heavy going at times...\n",
        "Winds up with a scene in which a merry-go-round goes wild, spins like a pin wheel, and crashes in a gaudy blaze of explosions that no earthly carrousel could touch off. The movie itself is the same way: implausible but intriguing and great fun to ride.\n",
        "Perhaps Strangers on a Train still hasn't yielded all its secrets.\n",
        "Hitchcock erects a web of guilt around Granger, who 'agreed' to his wife's murder, a murder that suits him very well, and structures his film around a series of set pieces, ending with a paroxysm of violence on a circus carousel.\n",
        "Hitchcock was above all the master of great visual set pieces, and there are several famous sequences in Strangers on a Train.\n",
        "Given a good basis for a thriller in the Patricia Highsmith novel and a first-rate script, Hitchcock embroiders the plot into a gripping, palm-sweating piece of suspense.\n",
        "...his basic premise of fear fired by menace is so thin and so utterly unconvincing that the story just does not stand.\n",
        "Hitchcock conjures a deep-rooted, irony-rich complicity of father and daughter that seems borrowed from the films of Howard Hawks and suggests the inner compass that helps to guard against chasing the wrong man.\n",
        "Wyman is delightful as embryo actress but the choice femme spot goes to Dietrich.\n",
        "The issues aren't satisfactorily resolved, but Hitchcock seems to be exploring the ways in which various falsehoods -- the falsehoods of acting, storytelling, and art in general -- can lead to the truth\n",
        "A fairly routine thriller, noted chiefly for its cheating flashback, though with much more to enjoy than its detractors -- including Hitchcock -- make out.\n",
        "One is strongly suspicious, after watching this helter-skelter film, that Mr. Hitchcock was much less interested in his over-all story than in individual scenes.\n",
        "A more critical and resonant Hollywood movie about the glorious disco culture screams to be made.\n",

        "The movie is flat, logy, and amateurish -- a Scotch - tape- and - balsa - wood job.\n",
        "54 is an entertaining and surprisingly serious look at the infamous New York discotheque, with a genuine nostalgia for the late '70s and early '80s, tempered by a healthy dose of jaundice - but without a sense of condescension or superiority.\n",
        "Except for Myers, and for many he will make the movie worth watching. He's absolutely shagadelic and completely unexpected. This should have been his movie.\n",
        "You see garbage bags filled with cash, a lot of avid cocaine snorting and fleeting glimpses of Warhol and Truman Capote, but it all feels ho-hum.\n",
        "A disappointingly dull film.\n",

        "Where, under his stainless-steel incorruptibility, was Ness' gnawing flaw? To Mamet and De Palma, goodness and dullness seem inseparable.\n",
        "It's an action film without much personality or drive and without enough imaginative detail to make the action gripping or meaningful.\n",
        "It goes to that place that all films aspiring to greatness must attain: the country of myth, where all the figures must be larger and more vivid than life.\n",
        "The results are watchable enough, with a particularly adept use of Sean Connery, Chicago locations, and period details.\n",
        "The narrative thunders to its conclusion like a locomotive.\n",
        "It's vulgar, violent, funny and sometimes breathtakingly beautiful.\n",
        "An unqualified triumph.\n",
        "The Untouchables is a beautifully crafted portrait of Prohibition-era Chicago.\n",
        "...only marginally entertaining.\n",
        "...it does not have a great script, great performances or great direction.\n",
        "...an entertaining but incongruous mix of class and pulp.\n",
        "The outrageousness isn't consistently sustained, and the pic tends to peter out somewhere around the two thirds mark.\n",
        "Tasteless? Oh, yeah.\n",
        "A tone-deaf, scattershot and dispiritingly cheesy affair with more groans than laughs.\n",
        "A stupid lowdown vulgar comedy.\n",
        "Don't bother to hang around for the outtakes. They're not funny either.\n",
        "Though the jokey lines seem out of place, the somber tone of this 1998 action movie makes the political subtext more sincere and less grandiose than usual.\n",
        "The last blast of the summer is an exuberantly cheesy action opus featuring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Rob Schneider as an improbable pair of gung-ho heroes.\n",
        "For hardcore Van Damme and Sparks fans only.\n",
        "The plot is as incomprehensible as the dubbing, and many of the special effects are neither special nor effective.\n",
        "One of Van Damme's best movies ever.\n",
        "Almost worth attending for the experience of seeing how low film makers can sink in their never-ending quest to bilk the action picture audience out of a few hard-earned dollars.\n",
        "Something of a kaleidoscopic mess of a movie, but it has its moments.\n",
        "Was a film ever more appropriately titled than Knock Off?\n",
        "You've never seen so many pointlessly contrived optical effects shots in your life.\n",
        "Giddily atypical in its style even as it explores lurid new byways of Hitchcock's familiar obsessions.\n",
        "Under Capricorn is overlong and talky, with scant measure of the Alfred Hitchcock thriller tricks.\n",
        "A strangely unexciting but emotionally intriguing Hitchcock costume drama with echoes of Rebecca and Suspicion.\n",
        "It seems that neither Miss Bergman nor Mr. Hitchcock has tangled here with stuff of any better than penny-dreadful substance and superfical demands.\n",
        "Shot in astonishingly elaborate long takes, this is the kind of film that finds the most brilliant poetry in the slightest movement of the camera -- a paradigm of cinematic expression.\n",
        "To put it mildly, Mr. Hitchcock and his writers have really let themselves go. Melodramatic action is their forte, but they scoff at speed limits this trip.\n",
        "Mr. & Mrs. Smith works on almost every level and against all odds.\n",
        "The couple's dark, deadpan banter is amusing, particularly during a car chase in which they rapidly exchange some home truths. But there's a coldness to their characters that is never resolved.\n",
        "Have we lost our minds and souls so completely to celebrity worship that drivel like Mr. and Mrs. Smith can thrive and prosper?\n",
        "Very good.\n",
        "The studio must have reasoned that Jolie and Brad Pitt are movie stars, so anything they do would be seen as fun and attractive -- and what could be more fun and attractive than their trying to kill each other and just about everybody else in the movie?\n",
        "It's a love story not for the faint of heart. In other words, it's a lot like marriage.\n",
        "A movie so in love with itself it hardly needs us at all.\n",
        "Who knows what went on behind the screen between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, but what's on the screen is extremely entertaining.\n",
        "Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie look like they had a terrific time making Mr. and Mrs. Smith -- but I certainly didn't have a good time watching it. Neither, I suspect, will many of you.\n",
        "Mr. & Mrs. Smith will prove a long, hard slog for filmgoers who don't think that simply gazing at Pitt and Jolie constitutes a fun night out.\n",
        "Essentially, Mr. & Mrs. Smith exists for the purpose of showing off the gorgeous faces and physiques of its two stars, and for giving its audience the dubious pleasure of watching them beat each other up.\n",
        "A high-gloss, high-caliber domestic squabble, a lip-lock and load romance that might just as easily have been called 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith & Wesson.'\n",
        "Mr. & Mrs. Smith is an awful movie with two very good-looking people in it.\n",
        "Pitt and Jolie make sexy sparring partners, but they can't lift this leaden material.\n",
        "It's not perfect. It's like a marriage.\n",
        "Their much-hyped kiss-kiss, bang-bang movie is an expensive time-waster, full of slow-motion explosions and big-scene payoffs that turn out to be duds.\n",
        "There's no real kick to all the wanton destruction, no sense of real thrill or peril, because the movie, which was written by Simon Kinberg (and rewritten, and then rewritten some more during production) chickens out.\n",
        "A cute little romantic comedy buried under enough overblown action, gaudy firepower and special effects to fill a Jerry Bruckheimer picture.\n",
        "By common consent, one of Alfred Hitchcock's poorest and least personal works, though it has some compensations.\n",
        "Superb direction, excellent casting, expressive playing and fine production offset an uneven screenplay to make Jamaica Inn a gripping version of the Daphne du Maurier novel.\n",
        "The result is weird, but not wonderful.\n",
        "Having set his own standards, Alfred Hitchcock must be judged by them; and, by them, his Jamaica Inn is merely journeyman melodrama.\n",
        "This film, minus the deft and artistic handling of the director, Alfred Hitchcock, despite its cast and photography, would not stand up for Grade A candidacy.\n",
        "This is vintage Hitchcock, with the pacing and superb editing that marked not only his 30s style but eventually every film that had any aspirations whatever to achieving suspense and rhythm.\n",
        "Very much of its time (in a good way), and very enjoyable.\n",
        "Just in under the wire to challenge for a place on the year's best ten is The Lady Vanishes, latest of the melodramatic classics made by England's greatest director, Alfred Hitchcock.\n",
        "Not top-notch Hitchcock, but engrossing enough.\n",
        "Alfred Hitchcock, England's jovial and rotund master of melodrama, has turned out another crisply paced, excellently performed film.\n",
        "One of the most entertaining of Hitchcock's English films.\n",
        "We won't tell you what happens. That would be to cheat Mr. Hitchcock of his just reward, but it is a warning what you may expect -- which, as is the way of all Hitchcock melodramas, is the unexpected.\n",
        "A peculiar and neglected early Hitchcock stage adaptation.\n",
        "The plotting is half-baked and the special effects are so crude that they make the back projection in Marnie look like the last word in verisimilitude.\n",
        "And so it is: this early (1932) Hitchcock film shows more signs of the artist to come than any of his other British movies.\n",
        "The playing is exceptional, both men and women.\n",
        "Mr. Galsworthy's narrative is bound to enlist one's attention, but Mr. Hitchcock, who is responsible for the adaptation as well as the direction, cannot be said to have accomplished either task in a fashion the subject deserves.\n",
        "A rather stagy and creaky early talkie (1931) by Alfred Hitchcock.\n",
        "Three-quarters of the film is just photographed stage play -- excellently photographed, but slow in action.\n",
        "By its failure to blend the two poles of drama the film resolves itself into virtually two plays.\n",
        "A fairly deadly case of canned theater that's pretty close to what Hitchcock many years later would refer to as 'photographs of people talking.'\n",
        "It's no masterpiece, but it's certainly something to see: Hitchcock's early work is full of surprises, dramatic and stylistic.\n",
        "The Hall Caine novel from which this film was adapted is a weak one, but the director has done his best with it.\n",
        "Filled with enchanting scenes and the story itself is quite well told.\n",
        "A distinctly un-Hitchcockian melodrama.\n",
        "That Blackmail has merits is admitted by all who have seen it.\n",
        "Echoing the words of the great Porter song, Easy Virtue deliciously misbehaves.\n",
        "These are good actors telling a good story, so the virtue is indeed easy to grasp, and a fine time should be had by all.\n",
        "Easy Virtue has all the elements for a sprightly romp with serious underpinnings, and occasionally it achieves that balance. But it's marred by attempts at farce that are as belabored as they are ill-advised.\n",
        "A winning, witty fox trot through the Roaring 20s, when men were men, women were liberating themselves and the 'to the manner born' were losing their grip on their manners -- and manors.\n",
        "Jessica Biel gets more publicity for her body and her boyfriend than for her acting ability, but Easy Virtue may be cause for a reassessment.\n",
        "What might've been a scrumptious, chocolatey dessert of a movie -- a Noel Coward delite -- is instead a scoop of lemon ice, not filling, faintly sweet and mostly water.\n",
        "Full of forced jocularity and drawing-room hissy fits, with its cast parading around in vintage threads and antique cars, Easy Virtue is a close-to-insufferable souffle based on the 1925 Noel Coward play.\n",
        "It lumbers instead of dazzles, drags where it should feint and jab.\n",
        "The only characters who seem anchored in some form of reality are the hero's parents...all the others, from siblings to servants, are standard-issue eccentrics or the subjects of running gags.\n",
        "[Director] Elliott had a choice in Easy Virtue, to turn away from the horror or face it. He takes his time, but he eventually does face it -- and delivers up a good movie.\n",
        "Full of gorgeous architecture and sightlines but a bit too cold for comfort and with an all-too pervasive air of tedium.\n",
        "Elliott nearly turns the whole affair into a musical, with characters singing snatches of Coward and Cole Porter songs. But his sense of humor is extremely broad.\n",
        "There's supposed to be some distance between the main character and the family she marries into &#8212; but that distance probably shouldn't include acting styles.\n",
        "Those coming in cold may be forgiven for thinking they've wandered into Atonement remade as a farce.\n",
        "Easy Virtue has enough traces of Coward's wit to keep you hoping for the first hour or so, but then the film collapses under the weight of too many misguided innovations.\n",
        "Unusually for a play by Noel Coward, Love struggles while conquering All in Easy Virtue, a subversive view of British country-house society between the wars.\n",
        "Jessica Biel in a teacup-rattling '20s period piece? With her lewd pinup grin and husky flat voice, she sticks out like a sore starlet in Easy Virtue -- but that's the whole point in this loosely 'freshened up' version of a Noel Coward play.\n",
        "Funny, but ordinary.\n",
        "Biel delivers the best performance of her young career.\n",
        "It's a treasure hunt reduced to isolated jolts and more clues than you can shake a stick at (every fly on the wall and child's drawing bristles with unholy significance), and an utter waste of Watts.\n",
        "A stylish Hollywood remake of the Japanese horror sensation that unfortunately has little personality of its own.\n",
        "Elegantly shot by Bojan Bazelli and designed by Tom Duffield, with a chilling Hans Zimmer score, this visually stunning movie serves up generous dollops of designer creepiness.\n",
        "Not everything it might have been, then, but decent enough to have you tracking down the original.\n",
        "I found The Ring moderately absorbing, largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound.\n",
        "The boo! factor is waaaay up there -- a nine on a scale of 10. But the makes-sense factor is something like a three, at best.\n",
        "Creeps you out in high style, even if Nakata did it better.\n",
        "It's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just can't take it any more.\n",
        "The creepiest, clammiest, twitchiest squealfest in months.\n",
        "At times, the suspense is palpable, but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential.\n",
        "With its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere, The Ring makes its stupidity more than obvious. It's painful.\n",
        "Shows surprising restraint for an American remake, effective atmosphere from cinematographer Bojan Bazelli, good acting from Watts and some nice surprises.\n",
        "So good it's scary.\n",
        "Verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies.\n",
        "It's truly a fascinating mind game that twists and turns itself into your subconscious.\n",
        "A thought-provoking horror film that packs a visceral wallop.\n",
        "The most unsettling and inspired horror film since The Blair Witch Project.\n",
        "It's far better than most gimmicky horror films.\n",
        "Rarely has a more serious effort produced a less serious result.\n",
        "The cast works hard to make you believe they believe what the screenwriter tells them to believe. But in the end, it all seems contrived and silly.\n",
        "This strained, empty effort doesn't work as homage or update, and in its darkly violent sensibility has neither the glamour of Brian De Palma's referential nightmares or even the narrative fuel of the serial-killer-obsessed procedurals that dominate tv.\n",
        "Filled with second-rate Brian DePalma twists, noirishly blurred lights and usually solid actors mouthing potboiler brine, The Lodger resembles bottom-shelf '80s dreck.\n",
        "A good cast can't save The Lodger, the utterly wrongheaded fourth movie version of a 1910 novel inspired by Jack the Ripper that was most famously filmed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1926.\n",
        "What needed to be a taut, structurally sound psychothriller instead malfunctions from the start.\n",
        "The Lodger is a spooky story ruined by lumpen dialogue, cloddish performances and a director and writer (David Ondaatje) oblivious to both.\n",
        "Nodding, winking and sighing, The Lodger lumbers its way to a final twist so anticlimactic and silly as to warrant an incredulous titter.\n",
        "This serial-killer procedural is about a West Hollywood slasher who apes Jack the Ripper, but the real crime is the travesty writer-director David Ondaatje perpetrates on Hitchcock.\n",
        "The wholesome pup's poker face alone, however, hardly accounts for the film's failure to thrill. Damon's character doesn't really have that much stake in the story's outcome.\n",
        "Intermittently engaging but dramatically slack.\n",
        "Gretchen Mol, Edward Norton, John Turturro, Martin Landau, and Famke Janssen costar; they're all pretty good, but not good enough to make this 1998 feature worth seeing.\n",
        "The end result is still short of a winning hand, since the screenplay is so utterly predictable.\n",
        "Though it's a good-looking flick with some smart acting and a few flashy runs, it barely breaks even dramatically, and feels, overall, like a good chance wasted.\n",
        "In fighting to show the psychological complexities in Mike that the script ignores, Damon plays it like a rounder instead of a grinder. This kid still has surprises up his sleeve.\n",
        "Though Damon is an actor who's flatly impossible not to root for, the longer this film lasts the less patience we have to stay with him.\n",
        "A disappointing mediocrity.\n",
        "Mischievously entertaining!\n",
        "According to director John Dahl's Rounders, professional poker players are very, very interesting people -- for about five minutes.\n",
        "It's a movie of character and milieu, both of which it evokes brilliantly.\n",
        "A sure bet!\n",
        "No energy!\n",
        "Rounders cheerfully buys into compulsive gambling!\n",
        "Rounders' script is pretty shabby going. Well, not shabby, really, just simplistic.\n",
        "Rounders is not breakthrough material, but it makes for an entertaining evening out.\n",
        "A promising cast can't rescue a script without surprises!\n",
        "Damon, Norton are game, but Rounders script a letdown.\n",
        "Cube was named best Canadian debut feature at Toronto last year, and there's no questioning Natali, clearly a visionary, is an important new talent.\n",
        "Surprisingly gripping.\n",
        "If writer-director Vincenzo Natali, storyboard artist for Keanu Reeve's Johnny Mnemonic, were as comfortable with dialogue and dramatizing characters as he is with images, this first feature of his might have worked better.\n",
        "Whether he would have won at the next Olympics, we'll never know. What we do know is that Towne, a man of ruefully romantic temperament, has found a soulmate in Steve Prefontaine.\n",
        "With a very good part for a change, Sutherland invests the imposing Bowerman with a host of subtly expressed attitudes toward his most illustrious charge.\n",
        "he understated cinematography by Conrad Hall and sterling work from Crudup and Sutherland lend a patina of class, yet it's in the end a po-faced film.\n",
        "Without Limits wins as a sports film precisely because it's not really about sports or a great victory.\n",
        "Without Limits is an admirable departure from the norm, but its greatest strength doubles as an undermining weakness.\n",
        "As Pre, Billy Crudup is dynamite -- a magnetic star presence who's unafraid to show how Pre's drive also makes him a bit of a prick.\n",
        "Towne's most important contribution, aside from his gift for structure and willingness to direct this story in a classic, straight-ahead manner, is the power of his words.\n",
        "Definitely has its problems, but it's still one of the best sports movies I've ever seen.\n",
        "Its wisdom, and clearly Mr. Towne's, lies in the film's way of filtering a young man's headstrong nature through an older man's more rueful point of view.\n",
        "Sutherland's performance is the film's treasure.\n",
        "Beautifully made and features a marvelous performance by Donald Sutherland as the track coach Bill Bowerman, but the movie is no more than moderately interesting.\n",
        "Without Limits makes for an engrossing examination of the will to win, the importance of icons in American sports, and the interference of money in amateur athletics.\n",
        "It's not a bad film, but Towne and his star, the charismatic Billy Crudup, never fire the imagination in the way their inspirational, respectful biopic is obviously intended to.\n",
        "Where can a movie like this go except straight into a brick wall?\n",
        "In his directorial debut, Tony Bill assembles a truly remarkable cast of youngsters with little or no previous acting experience.\n",
        "A film of ingredients, rather than ideas realized and integrated: it panders on different, disjunctive levels.\n",
        "The message that accompanies the central theme -- Kids are basically Nice -- is that Brute Force Rules.\n",
        "This movie is fun to watch because it touches memories that are shared by most of us, and because its young characters are recognizable individuals, and not simplified cartoon figures like so many movie teen-agers.\n",
        "A sweet little movie about characters who really seem to be people, and that sort of verisimilitude is rarer than it ought to be nowadays.\n",
        "Director Laurent Cantet has pulled together a story that feels startlingly authentic, using Mike Leigh-like methods of extensive improvisation with a cast of real inner-city kids and a real teacher. To paraphrase the Buck Owens/Beatles hit, all they had\n",
        "All the performers are tops.\n",
        "Enormously entertaining.\n",
        "One of the best entertainments of 1987.\n",
        "Underpinning what is a charming, protean love-triangle is a serious statement about the function, value, and direction of television news.\n",
        "The movie is a sarcastic and carefully detailed picture of a world Mr. Brooks finds fascinating and also a little scary.\n",
        "Broadcast News has a lot of interesting things to say about television. But the thing it does best is look into a certain kind of personality and a certain kind of relationship.\n",
        "The film is so ingratiatingly high-spirited, and the performances so full of sass and vigor, that in the long run it doesn't really matter much.\n",
        "Brooks' observations are as keen as Woody Allen's but without the neurotic narcissism.\n",
        "Mrs. Hoffs should not make jokes about film making.\n",
        "Hard to say what this is really, except maybe an inadvertent documentary on child abuse.\n",
        "A perfectly dreadful film whose chief selling point is that it's the first starring role for Bangles lead singer Susanna Hoffs and that the director is none other than Mom, Tamar Simon Hoffs.\n",
        "How will the working class be educated to survive and thrive in the computer age? This intoxicating movie has an answer: let her strut her outer-borough wisdom from Wall Street to the Pacific Rim. Watch her fatten portfolios as she melts hearts.\n",
        "Griffith's talent, energy, and sexiness give it some drive and punch.\n",
        "Working Girl is enjoyable largely due to the fun of watching scrappy, sexy, unpredictable Melanie Griffith rise from Staten Island secretary to Wall Street whiz.\n",
        "The interaction between the female leads is so funny that you don't care if the leading man never turns up.\n",
        "Working Girl, always fun even when at its most frivolous, has the benefit of the cinematographer Michael Ballhaus's sharp visual sense of board room chic, and of supporting characters who help carry its class distinctions beyond simple caricature.\n",
        "This scrumptious romantic comedy with its blithe cast is as easy to watch as swirling ball gowns and dancing feet. But oh me, oh my, how much more demanding it is to be a fairy tale heroine these days.\n",
        "Working Girl is Nichols returning to the top of his form, and Griffith finding hers.\n",
        "Nichols' timing seems off.\n",
        "Pfeiffer is at her best, and there's plenty of action, although you may feel that some of the gags involving a scorned and vengeful wife (Mercedes Ruehl) are a bit shopworn.\n",
        "The enormous cast is a total delight, starting with Pfeiffer, with hair dyed dark, a New York accent and a continuously nervous edge.\n",
        "Amazingly, for all its hip anarchy, it's finally an oddly old-fashioned slice of entertainment. Preston Sturges might have approved.\n",
        "Miss Pfeiffer, who looks utterly ravishing in outfits that set the teeth on edge, turns Angela's plight into something funny, but she seems eminently sane even when the movie does not.\n",
        "Demme keeps his characters (scripted by Barry Strugatz and Mark R. Burns) from wandering into the Buffoon Zone.\n",
        "A mix of goofy ethnicity, romance and self-discovery, \"Married to the Mob\" is an offer you can't refuse.\n",
        "Cusack and Skye's relationship develops nicely and believably, but Crowe has not written an entirely convincing character for the latter to play.\n",
        "At last, a teenage love story with real characters instead of cliches, poses, and attitudes.\n",
        "he love story is as old-fashioned as the jokes are old hat, but Crowe's amusing script and unforced direction allow the actors to develop reasonably authentic characters from stereotypical roles.\n",
        "The film is all charming performances and grace notes, but there are plenty of worse things to be.\n",
        "The cast is irresistibly charming, down to the bit parts by Lili Taylor and Amy Brooks as Lloyd's best friends.\n",
        "Smart, well-developed characters, believable situations, and a solid emotional investment for us in the film's people and circumstances\n",
        "A movie like this is possible because its maker believes in the young characters, and in doing the right thing, and in staying true to oneself.\n",
        "Parasite is lethargic between its terror scenes, making it a test of patience for all but the fanatical followers of horror cheapies.\n",
        "Uninspired actors intone a banal script, reduced by clumsy pacing to a minimum of suspense.\n",
        "This is a badly acted B movie without much flair for involving its audience.\n",
        "Offputting, even at times nasty.\n",
        "A thin, cynical calculation.\n",
        "This movie is clearly intended to appeal to the prurient interests of dirty old men of all ages.\n",
        "Blame It on Rio is not simply humorless. It also spreads gloom.\n",
        "This is a terrible, terrible worthless movie that you shouldn't give any time to.\n",
        "I'm confident the material girl has more good material for movies ahead of her.\n",
        "Does anyone remember when Madonna was considered shocking?\n",
        "At 84 minutes, the movie feels both overpadded and underdeveloped.\n",
        "Message to the director: Don't quit your day job just yet, but in the category of multidisciplinary artists moonlighting as filmmakers, I'll take you over Julian Schnabel any day.\n",
        "Nothing in this cynical bit of claptrap feels remotely real.\n",
        "This is a movie that's just sort of there, and nobody much would have paid any attention to it without the Madonna connection. And chances are nobody much will even with that connection.\n",
        "For an artist who has spent so much of her career reinventing herself to lead pop culture, not to mention fatten her pocketbook, Madonna seems at her most sincere behind this camera. She coaxes genuine moments from the three principals.\n",
        "Madonna has made a career out of toying with image and ego, but this is a vanity project in the smallest sense possible.\n",
        "Madonna shoots it all like a home movie made by someone who has been on the other side of the camera so often, doing music videos, reality no longer feels remotely real.\n",
        "Impossibly arty and, at times, narratively incoherent, Filth and Wisdom still has its goofy charms.\n",
        "Madonna fans will probably want to go anyway -- hey, I can't stop you -- but I can tell you that the movie delivers on neither of the promises of its title.\n",
        "Madonna, making her directorial debut, aims for the romping irreverence of Richard Lester's 60s comedies, and though she lacks the formal control to pull it off, this is a charming mess.\n",
        "This is a very deeply non-caring movie. I liked Hutz when he sang. I imagine Gene Shalit ate his heart out when he saw Hutz's moustache.\n",
        "I sort of liked it.\n",
        "Filth and Wisdom is pretentious and structurally flawed, never truly coming together as a coherent work.\n",
        "Thoroughly inept in just about every aspect.\n",
        "[A] bright, occasionally imbecilic teen comedy.\n",
        "John Cusack and Demi Moore are such charming personalities that they are appealing even in so silly a setting. There is a good chemistry between them. It would be interesting to see them make a film together, instead of being stock figures.\n",
        "An extraordinarily well-made movie, which wastes no words or images in telling a conventional but compelling story.\n",
        "The same histrionic fireworks that gripped theater audiences will prove even more compelling to filmgoers due to the star power and dramatic screw-tightening.\n",
        "The intellectual cut-and-thrust of the courtroom is largely absent here, and the denouement seems slick, arbitrary, and derived from the Captain Queeg catalogue.\n",
        "The screenplay is a good one, directed with care and acted, for the most part, with terrific conviction.\n",
        "That the performances are uniformly outstanding is a tribute to Rob Reiner (Misery), who directs with masterly assurance, fusing suspense and character to create a movie that literally vibrates with energy.\n",
        "Men is full of loaded, manly moments, great clashes of will and excellent buzz cuts.\n",
        "A Few Good Men is one of those movies that tells you what it's going to do, does it, and then tells you what it did.\n",
        "It's a grand undertaking that wrangles with the heavy questions that cropped up at Nuremberg and My Lai, questions that deserve and get lots of imposing shots of monuments and not a little swashbuckling from the big stars.\n",
        "The movie gets credit for not making the high life seem colorful or funny.\n",
        "Unsettling and-yes-often scorchingly funny!\n",
        "Wicked sense of humor!\n",
        "As enveloping as it is darkly cautionary!\n",
        "The trouble is that it's hard to care!\n",
        "Stiller's attempted image makeover, though admirable, doesn't make it.\n",
        "Rollicking! A high-energy adaptation!\n",
        "The script shifts audience sympathies about quite adroitly, though it's a pity all the men had to be such humbugs.\n",
        "A well-oiled machine manufactured to tap our welled-up ducts.\n",
        "Even director Carl Franklin...can't prevent One True Thing from descending into chick-movie hell.\n",
        "One True Thing demonstrates that the power of simple things, the transcendent nature of the ordinary, can make for riveting filmmaking.\n",
        "It is the craftsmanship that elevates One True Thing above the level of a soaper.\n",
        "Meryl Streep is an actress of such transcendent skill and sympathy that she regularly elevates her material, taking it up several notches and giving us feelings, insights, feelings and textures the original writer may have just missed expressing.\n",
        "Yes, Meryl Streep is phenomenal again!\n",
        "Franklin seems ill-suited to this cast and this material.\n",
        "One True Thing celebrates the very things you don't miss, or even know exist, until they are gone.\n",
        "Streep's performance makes the movie worth seeing.\n",
        "Although the plot rarely excels, the actors bring enough to their roles to transform this motion picture into a satisfying weeper.\n",
        "An emotional drama!\n",
        "Its strong cast and restrained direction lift it above the Kleenex.\n",
        "Streep and Hurt, two of the best gestural actors working, let the showboating tics fly fast and thick.\n",
        "Streep is luminous as the hypermaternal Kate.\n",
        "Sensitively written, fluidly directed and expertly acted!\n",
        "Streep shines!\n",
        "One True Thing is real enough to be a film you can believe in.\n",
        "The contrast between Tucker's motormouth and Chan's man of few words should be funnier, but the plot -- which is cliched without quite becoming self-reflexive -- and the uneven pace dampen most of their moments.\n",
        "Much of the best dialogue, you suspect, was improvised by Tucker and Chan, who seem truly taken with each other and make a delightful, ordinary-extraordinary pair.\n",
        "Rush Hour is a righteous title for an action comedy, and that's only the beginning.\n",
        "Rush Hour effectively teams Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in a formulaic but funny action comedy that should please fans of both stars.\n",
        "A kick-happy buddy film!\n",
        "So why is that when Chan makes a real Hollywood movie the results are so disappointing?\n",
        "Raucously entertaining!\n",
        "Hollywood calculation can't match the primitive eager-to-please quality that made those Hong Kong films refreshing; they were appealing because they were so free of irony.\n",
        "What a lousy movie!\n",
        "The movie is no more than a well-produced confection designed for quick payoff in the big cities, but it's pretty consistently funny.\n",
        "As Chan moved from Hong Kong to Hollywood, something got lost in the translation.\n",
        "Classy and brassy, Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are a funky, well-matched duo in New Line's winning Rush Hour.\n",
        "Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker make an entertaining team!\n",
        "There's something fresher in this Merchant-Ivory film about an expatriate family in Paris in the 1970s: It's not as tasteful, stately, and restrained as their other literary adaptations.\n",
        "Ronin reps a pleasurable throwback to the sort of gritty, low-tech international thriller that was a staple of the 1960s.\n",
        "At times, amid this movie's flurry of robustly filmed heists, betrayals and car chases, it's so good, you begin to wonder if inspiration and depth aren't overrated.\n",
        "I enjoyed the film on two levels: for its skill and its silliness.\n",
        "Clunky and contrived!\n",
        "Ronin plays like death warmed over!\n",
        "Ronin is a generally familiar if murky and occasionally pretentious exercise.\n",
        "Frankenheimer propels this tale of intrigue through its tightly plotted paces with such conviction that he even makes an action hero out of Robert De Niro.\n",
        "A cunning spy thriller!\n",
        "The chases in Ronin are among the most dynamic road clashes the movies have offered in some time.\n",
        "Like Frankenstein's monster before the lightning strikes, it's all recycled cold flesh and bolts, without a twitch of originality.\n",
        "A low-voltage drive-in movie, made strictly by the book.\n",
        "It's just a weary sigh over how Scream's juicy archness has already turned into boilerplate.\n",
        "Competently made!\n",
        "Those of us with brain cells, however, will spit out this Scream retread like it was spider-egg-laced bubble gum.\n",
        "A routine slasher, and not a particularly scary one.\n",
        "A teen-age moviegoer's dream.\n",
        "A proud product of the Scream cookie-cutter!\n",
        "Can we please declare a moratorium on Scream rip-offs?\n",
        "it's just the old-fashioned, yikes-this-stinks variety.\n",
        "As interesting as the urban legend premise is, it's not enough to sustain the movie.\n",
        "This is an eye-filling and often stirring movie.\n",
        "The numerous, unflinchingly filmed scenes of public and gang rape make this a visceral, if gruelling, experience, especially when juxtaposed with sprawling, beautifully photographed vistas of the Indian deserts and mountain ranges.\n",
        "An astonishing, overpowering piece of rabble-rousing, consciousness-raising, epic-scale filmmaking.\n",
        "An exciting movie that brings Devi's story to life with passion but without passing judgment.\n",
        "Seema Biswas is convincing in the role: small, fierce, dark-eyed and indomitable.\n",
        "This film's a relentless right hook.\n",
        "At the center of the movie are two fine actresses who make Phoolan's unsettled character seem inevitable.\n",
        "This powerful but grueling Indian film is not only a tribute to her spirit, but also a searing indictment of a culture corrupted by the caste system and degraded by chauvinism.\n",
        "Devi is played by Seema Biswas as a fireball of unrelenting, white-hot fury -- a slap in the face to her country and its barbaric, outdated treatment of women.\n",
        "To watch the film -- directed with eye-opening vigor by Shekhar Kapur -- is to vicariously experience the social horrors of India's patriarchal system.\n",
        "An excellent examination of caste discrimination, human suffering, and the role of women in India's changing culture.\n",
        "Punchy, poetic pic that delves into the epic theme of youthful revolt.\n",
        "The film finally succumbs to its own abstraction with an ending that satisfies neither symbolism nor wish fulfillment.\n",
        "A film of tremendous resonance, coming when it did in 1968 with the force of a grenade.\n",
        "A modern classic in which Anderson minutely captures both the particular ethos of a public school and the general flavour of any structured community.\n",
        "If . . . is so good and strong that even those things in the movie that strike me as being first-class mistakes are of more interest than entire movies made by smoothly consistent, lesser directors.\n",
        "First-time directors David Moreau and Xavier Palud have crafted a highly effective horror film that combines a plausible narrative with accomplished use of sound and image.\n",
        "Moreau and Palud play on the way our minds fill in the gaps of the unknown and the very primal fear of things going bump in the night.\n",
        "A nerve-wracking finale, a 30-minute chase through the house's catacombs, followed by a closing image that will chill you to the bone.\n",
        "Those who like their horror served up neat, no chaser, can safely belly up to Them. It is a pared-down French thriller that trades splatter and gore for tense efficiency.\n",
        "Them is Haneke on training wheels.\n",
        "The fright is crafted well enough, but the twist at the end calls for more originality than filmmakers David Moreau and Xavier Palud wield.\n",
        "Them is more suspenseful than gory; there's little blood, but the tension gradually builds to a nail-biting level - an impressive feat, considering the movie is essentially one long chase.\n",
        "Taut and remorseless, Them, which is allegedly based on actual events, is the perfect antidote to the stomach-churning gore served up by so many in the current crop of horror films.\n",
        "It should scare up a bit of boxoffice as it does hearken back to the day when horror meant the imagination gone wild rather than severed body parts. Otherwise, the film is all too pointless.\n",
        "The movie Them revels in atmosphere, using long unbroken takes and ambient sound to lull you into complacency before unleashing nerve-jangling shocks.\n",
        "If you want an hour or so of terror, put your faith in Them.\n",
        "If you're going to imply that a French couple being terrorized in a remote Romanian mansion adds up to something more than an arbitrary (and rather repetitive) don't-go-in-the-basement thriller, then you'd better deliver the goods.\n",
        "Lensed with skill to no particular end.\n",
        "A 20-minute calling card short extended to a tolerance-stretching 74 minutes, this is an effectively directed but ultimately pointless wind-up exercise.\n",
        "[It's] supposed to be scathing, but the pleasure it affords is like what you get from watching the Oscars: celebrity spotting and in-jokes.\n",
        "Mercilessly satiric yet good-natured, this enormously entertaining slam dunk quite possibly is the most resonant Hollywood saga since the days of Sunset Blvd. and The Bad and the Beautiful.\n",
        "A movie about today's Hollywood -- hilarious and heartless in about equal measure, and often at the same time.\n",
        "Mr. Altman's most subversive message here is not that it's possible to get away with murder in Hollywood, but that the most grievous sin, in Hollywood terms anyway, is to make a film that flops.\n",
        "[Altman] sticks it to every target, himself and us included, with a wicked zest that hurts only when you laugh.\n",
        "The Player is a rare commodity. It's brilliant and a guilty pleasure.\n",
        "Altman loves practical jokes, and The Player is his craftiest prank, his jolly last laugh.\n",
        "Though there are laughs along the way, this is a truly mean-spirited picture.\n",
        "With its blunt, artless angst, the picture leaves you feeling depleted, squashed.\n",
        "One long cry of anguish about the price of fame comes perilously close to self-pity. And self-abuse.\n",
        "It's the first Woody Allen film in which impotence has become the situation rather than the problem. This is a movie about a guy who has given up.\n",
        "Invokes the mood of an early Fellini film as it swirls through the troubled recollections of a film director, played by Mr. Allen.\n",
        "An original movie, though not Tim Burton's best.\n",
        "A delightful and delicate comic fable.\n",
        "It remains curiously hollow.\n",
        "Mr. Burton invests awe-inspiring ingenuity into the process of reinventing something very small.\n",
        "Burton's richly entertaining update of the Frankenstein story is the year's most comic, romantic and haunting film fantasy.\n",
        "Enchantment on the cutting edge, a dark yet heartfelt portrait of the artist as a young mannequin.\n",
        "Burton has not yet found the storytelling and character-building strength to go along with his pictorial flair.\n",
        "The film has an unapologetically adolescent purity about it that transcends what would ordinarily be the shortcomings of its script.\n",
        "Depp is perfectly cast, Burton builds a surrealistically funny cul-de-sac world, and there are some very funny performances from grownups Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker and Alan Arkin.\n",
        "The romanticism has a personal dimension -- for Edward is, of course, Burton's surreal portrait of himself as an artist: a wounded child converting his private darkness into outlandish pop visions. Like Edward, he finds the light.\n",
        "Kids may be puzzled by rebellious worker ants chanting Marxist slogans, but their parental guides may welcome the relief from the prevailing blandness of family films.\n",
        "Visually striking and dynamically shot, this has strong characters and no shortage of incident.\n",
        "The filmmakers seem to have deliberately snubbed the traditional audience for animated features.\n",
        "It's a perfect picnic, without the pesky human interference.\n",
        "Antz is refreshingly naughty and nice.\n",
        "Antz is brief enough, clocking in at 83 minutes, but its story is too predictable to make an impact even in such a short space.\n",
        "A kids' movie that will leave grown-ups quoting the best lines to one another.\n",
        "The computer animation is first rate and filled with the kind of \"Wow! Look at that!\" wizardry that is eventually going to make Toy Story look about as technically sophisticated as South Park.\n",
        "Antz is about the relief felt by star actors freed from the constraints of their physical selves and the egos that go with them.\n",
        "It's a well-written, witty tale, expertly executed!\n",
        "An excellent piece of work!\n",
        "Visually, it's more impressive than Disney's Toy Story. On a script level, it was developed as much with a mature audience in mind as with the usual pre-pubescent crowd.\n",
        "Distinctive, delightful!\n",
        "Antz works best just showing off its prodigious voice talent and playing lightheartedly with the curious possibilities of a buggy world.\n",
        "It's fresh, exhilarating, funny, able to tell an old story in a beguiling new way!\n",
        "It enters into a microscopic world and makes it into a world so vast and threatening that comparisons with Star Wars are not unjustified!\n",
        "The kids will like it. You'll laugh.\n",
        "Antz takes a huge step forward for computer animation!\n",
        "A dazzling delight!\n",
        "Allen provides plenty of comic relief, and the computer-generated animation is pretty impressive.\n",
        "The performances are solid, with Sinise's sobriety and lack of histrionics, especially, making him an anchoring and sympathetic presence.\n",
        "A worthy successor to those sci-fi B-movies of old even if it is nowhere in the league of such Dick-inspired films as Total Recall and Blade Runner.\n",
        "Feels less like a cousin to Blade Runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the Escape From New York series.\n",
        "Pushes the same old cliches in Blade Runner packaging.\n",
        "Everything about Impostor ... is both familiar and profoundly unoriginal.\n",
        "In the end, alas, the obvious interests of an actor of Sinise's range and depth are subsumed to the blunt demands of a standardized chase movie.\n",
        "Unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction, Impostor is opening today at a theater near you.\n",
        "Impostor isn't really a movie, it's only impersonating one.\n",
        "Includes too much obvious padding.\n",
        "In the transition from prescient work of fiction to pummelling popcorn flick, Impostor seems to have had its soul hijacked.\n",
        "It's another clone that looks good but has no soul.\n",
        "This movie is something of an impostor itself, stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work.\n",
        "Impostor is a step down for director Gary Fleder.\n",
        "It's a big production, but the movie feels somewhat counterfeit.\n",
        "Impostor doesn't do much with its template, despite a remarkably strong cast.\n",
        "The movie is so thoughtlessly assembled.\n",
        "Impostor is really little more than an extended Outer Limits episode.\n",
        "Looks like a nifty little sci-fi film noir but is actually a noisy mess.\n",
        "You will spend an hour and a half feeling adequately entertained if you're a sucker for sci-fi-run-run-run flicks.\n",
        "Impostor is likely to be best appreciated by dedicated sci-fi fans, admirers of Dick in particular.\n",

        "More schmaltzy than funny.\n",
        "Shun this witless showcase for the Saturday Night Live double act of Ferrell and Kattan.\n",
        "A Night at the Roxbury probably never had a shot at being funny anyway, but I don't think it planned to be pathetic. It's the first comedy I've attended where you feel that to laugh would be cruel to the characters.\n",
        "Basically a longer version of its poster.\n",
        "Anyone who is more than momentarily diverted by this motion picture has such a radically different idea from me of what constitutes 'entertainment' that we may never agree on anything.\n",
        "Let's look at the bright side. America is still the land of opportunity if Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan can make a movie.\n",
        "The director, John Fortenberry, whose background is in television, has probably done the best that can be done with characters who were never meant to speak.\n",
        "The afterlife movie soars to new visionary heights in 'What Dreams May Come.'\n",
        "If the film's morose sentimentality sidesteps ludicrousness, it's also not very dramatic.\n",
        "In both concept and execution, they testify to painfully banal sensibilities.\n",
        "A visual blast.\n",
        "`What Dreams May Come' is so breathtaking, so beautiful, so bold in its imagination!\n",
        "Dripping with bold visual aplomb and sugar-coated mysticism, Vincent Ward's film is a staunch romantic's romance for those who believe-or want to believe-in eternal love.\n",
        "A visual feast not to be passed up and bound to pack an emotional punch for many viewers!\n",
        "Director Vincent Ward's view of heaven is surreal and spectacular!\n",
        "Few films delight the eye the way Vincent Ward's What Dreams May Come does!\n",
        "As rare and odd, and visually breathtaking, as modern filmmaking gets!\n",
        "A heaping serving of metaphysical gobbledygook wrapped in a physically striking package.\n",
        "All the weeping and hugging the characters do can't make up for the film's fatal lack of texture and psychological nuance.\n",
        "It's a disturbing, hopeless, irredeemable series of images that will scar you if you wander into it unprepared.\n",
        "Tomei, sashaying through the proceedings as kind of a sexy hood ornament, creates a buoyant chemistry with her combative b.f.\n",
        "While it's easy to imagine an infinite number of bad courtroom comedies based on this scenario, this movie turns out to be wonderful -- broad and low character comedy that's solidly imagined and beautifully played.\n",
        "It's a small, surprisingly gentle affair, prone to fits and starts, but fun.\n",
        "Easily the most inventive and enjoyable American film farce in a long time, even during those extended patches when it seems to be marking time or when it continues with a running gag that can't stay the distance.\n",
        "You might not remember much about My Cousin Vinny an hour later, but the cast makes the jokes (even the bad ones) go down easy.\n",
        "Joe Pesci is a total screen pleasure. He grabs whatever comes his way -- from GoodFellas to Home Alone</ -- and bullies it into something great. He's charming, menacing, and pitbullish all at the same time, a tenor-voiced imp of ceaseless energy.\n",
        "It's the kind of movie home video was invented for: Not worth the trip to the theater, but slam it into the VCR and you get your rental's worth.\n",
        "Weighed down by a dull setup featuring Ralph 'Karate Kid' Macchio, the movie gets a much-needed charge from Pesci, a bundle of bandy-legged impudence as Macchio's lawyer cousin, Vincent Gambini.\n",
        "I hate to go out on a limb after only one viewing, but Nashville strikes me as Altman's best film, and the most exciting dramatic musical since Blue Angel.\n",
        "I think that the power and the theme of the film lie in the fact that while some characters are more \"major\" than others, they are all subordinated to the music itself. It's like a river, running through the film, running through their life.\n",
        "A rare and puzzling movie: beautiful and cruel, passionate but strangely shallow.\n",
        "Nashville is one of Altman's best films, free of the rambling insider fooling around that sometimes mars entire chunks of every second or third picture.\n",
        "A masterpiece.\n",
        "It's a film that a lot of other directors will wish they'd had the brilliance to make.\n",
        "The acting is entirely unaffected. Every performance rings true, whether from an experienced actor or a neophyte.\n",
        "More than anything else, it is a tender poem to the wounded and the sad.\n",
        "It may not be earthshaking, but this calmly competent feel-good movie shows that a little sincerity can go a long way.\n",
        "The material lacks a biting edge.\n",

        "God only knows what was going through the filmmakers' minds when they came up with this one.\n",
        "While Murphy probably has what it takes to make the comedian-to-serious actor transition, he needs to do what Martin, Williams, and Carrey did: hold out for a good script.\n",
        "This screenplay was in no shape to be filmed; perhaps the filmmakers assumed that the mere presence of Eddie Murphy would repair its wrongs and give them a big opening weekend.\n",
        "The film never really explains where G came from or where he's going.\n",
        "A gritty, disturbing evocation of the ambiguities of big-city police work.\n",
        "As an example of the genre the French call a policier, the film is unexceptional.\n",
        "Flash: There is intelligent life in outer space. More, anyway, than in this amiable footnote of a movie.\n",
        "A hodge-podge of bits and pieces.\n",
        "Hyams' sequel to Kubrick's big daddy of sci-fi movies may not have the novelty of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but it is still a better film than anyone could have dared to expect.\n",
        "A good-looking, sharp-edged, entertaining, exciting space opera.\n",
        "A lot of care has gone into it, but it has no satirical substructure to match that of the Kubrick film, and which was eventually responsible for that film's continuing popularity.\n",
        "Now that enough time has elapsed since the release of 2010 for outraged 2001 fans to calm down, it can be seen that, while there was no decisive creative reason for Hyams' sequel to exist, it's not a bad movie.\n",
        "Children of a Lesser God, though given a handsome openness in Director Haines' production, cannot transcend the banalities of the play. But Matlin does. She is, one might say, a miracle worker.\n",
        "Hurt seems to be bucking for at least two Oscar nominations here: one for his performance, the other for best echo effects by an interpreter of signed speech.\n",
        "A touching and universal love story.\n",
        "A genuinely touching love story and a clever gloss on the barriers and extensions of language.\n",
        "There's scarcely a single moment in it that seems to be spontaneous.\n",
        "This is romance the way Hollywood used to make it, with both conflict and tenderness, at times capturing the texture of the day-to-day, at times finding the lyrical moments when two lovers find that time stops.\n",
        "The polemic drama of deaf rights translates into a heart-pounding love story -- the most passionately performed since Officer and a Gentleman.\n",
        "The performances are strong and wonderful.\n",
        "This is a tale of redemption and transcendence, of the hunchback of London Hospital, of the noble phantom who wanted to go to the opera, of Beauty and the Beast.\n",
        "Lynch's powerful depiction of Merrick (played by John Hurt) moves a viewer from revulsion and fear to empathy and tenderness. That's the very movement of the story itself.\n",
        "The picture itself is a strange trade-off between Lynch's personal themes -- the night world of obscure, disturbing sexual obsessions -- and the requirements of a middlebrow message movie.\n",
        "Director David Lynch has created an eerily compelling atmosphere in recounting a hideously deformed man's perilous life in Victorian England.\n",
        "A marvellous movie, shot in stunning black-and-white by Freddie Francis.\n",
        "I kept asking myself what the film was really trying to say about the human condition as reflected by John Merrick, and I kept drawing blanks.\n",
        "What we eventually see underneath this shell is not 'the study in dignity' that Ashley Montagu wrote about, but something far more poignant, a study in genteelness that somehow suppressed all rage.\n",
        "A movie that requires the viewer to meet it halfway. Those willing to make the effort will be rewarded with an exquisitely photographed and intricately layered drama.\n",
        "Something rare: a brave film about the emotional toll of slavery, the anguish of memory and the cruel divisions that still sear African American lives.\n",
        "Demme's potent adaptation of Morrison's novel may be substantial, but it is also engrossing.\n",
        "A knot of fierce emotions that is left for the viewer to untangle. Make the effort.\n",
        "Once this film gets its bearings, the unsentimental fierceness of its vision brushes obstacles and quibbles from its path.\n",
        "Demme succeeds uncannily well in bringing the novel's pulse to the screen.\n",
        "It is an urgently intimate epic of the heart, a dramatization of a monumental journey of pain, love and, tentatively, hope that has scorching emotional impact.\n",
        "I was sometimes confused about events as they happened, but all the pieces are there, and the film creates an emotional whole.\n",
        "Beloved has power and impressive artistry to spare!\n",
        "Everywhere you look in Beloved are signs of Demme's decay as a director -- the inattention to performances, the grindingly slow pacing, the sloppy, at times incoherent, story line and the straining grandiloquence of the tone.\n",
        "An overlong misfire that has only flashes of staggering power.\n",
        "A dense, jangled cataclysm of enigma and outrage.\n",
        "This screeching, grotesque display of shattered human dignity is about as subtle as five or ten thousand kicks in the head from a mule, with the kicks getting exceedingly baroque as the movie progresses.\n",
        "A powerful and disturbing motion picture!\n",
        "A remarkable movie!\n",
        "Beloved is a movie that swims in your bloodstream, echoes through your bones!\n",
        "Moves in leisurely fits and -- unencumbered by style or narrative complexity -- never loses its forward momentum.\n",
        "Although I enjoyed portions of the movie, I can't wholeheartedly recommend something with such an unfortunate and dissatisfying conclusion!\n",
        "A disappointing brew of slick commercial moviemaking and old-fashioned romantic fantasy!\n",
        "A saga that lacks the courage of its own odd convictions.\n",
        "Part comedy, part family drama, part romance, part special-effects mystery-adventure, and not entirely satisfying on any of these levels.\n",
        "A witch comedy so slapdash, plodding, and muddled it seems to have had a hex put on it.\n",
        "The trio of credited writers exhibits a complete failure of imagination!\n",
        "The movie doesn't seem sure what tone to adopt, veering uncertainly from horror to laughs to romance.\n",
        "The only thing unpredictable about Practical Magic is the unpleasant surprise one feels when the movie reveals itself as a irritatingly creepy supernatural thriller, rather than the offbeat romantic comedy the ads make it out to be.\n",
        "Practical Magic doesn't cast much of a spell!\n",
        "I, for one, would be thrilled to see Solondz's heart open in his future work. But it would be a mistake to flinch from the greatness of Happiness in the meantime.\n",
        "A creepy, well-acted story of contagious evil!\n",
        "A tense, psychological study of evil!\n",
        "Apt Pupil is a welcome attempt to reclaim the horror film genre from teen-driven slasher flick formulas!\n",
        "The most disappointing thing about Apt Pupil is the lack of sustained tension generated by director Bryan Singer.\n",
        "Apt Pupil is most compelling for its moral dimension.\n",
        "More disturbing than anything Keyser Soze could provide.\n",
        "When bodies are buried in cellars and cats are thrown into lighted ovens, the film reveals itself as unworthy of its subject matter.\n",

        "Nothing about the movie even makes sense!\n",
        "Major junk!\n",
        "Effective but not overwhelming, bone-chilling but not blood-freezing, Apt Pupil is a good shocker that misses the ultimate horror.\n",
        "Mr. McKellen, surely the finest living British actor, is the best reason to see Apt Pupil.\n",
        "Flat, undistinguished workmanship!\n",
        "Brought off with such skill and commitment that there isn't any time to snicker at its obviousness!\n",
        "The lighthearted fable Pleasantville takes some pointed swipes at the make-believe world of 1950s TV -- and none too soon.\n",
        "There's a terrific idea at the heart of Pleasantville, and it's a shame that its creator, Big screenwriter Gary Ross, can't figure where to take it.\n",
        "Endearing it definitely is, so much so that it's easy to overlook the simplicity, and the sly confidence trick that gets played on us.\n",
        "Ends up having more on its mind than it can successfully handle.\n",
        "An immensely intelligent entertainment!\n",
        "One of the year's best and most original films!\n",
        "This wonderful film speaks volumes about prejudice, the freedom of ideas, and the joys of diversity.\n",
        "Wildly ambitious!\n",
        "Technical elegance and fine performances mask the shallowness of a story as simpleminded as the '50s TV to which it condescends.\n",
        "Funny for about half an hour, Pleasantville thereafter becomes an increasingly lugubrious, ultimately exasperating mix of technological wonder and ideological idiocy.\n",
        "Pleasant, but not much more!\n",
        "Much of the interest here is in watching how the black-and-white scenes (filmed on color stock) begin to flower.\n",
        "A movie of unique ideological derangement that simultaneously demands and defies precise decoding.\n",
        "One of the year's delights!\n",
        "Lush, seductive!\n",
        "A most original film!\n",
        "This appealing formulaic action adventure (1998) displays a lot of conviction in its not-too-flashy action scenes and a little levity in the gradual socialization of Russell's character.\n",
        "The action is handled fairly well, but it's routine, and there's no satisfaction in seeing Todd waste men who are no more bloodthirsty than he is.\n",
        "I doubt that Kurt Russell has ever had less dialogue to work with than he has in this film.\n",
        "A potent comic-book-style action-adventure.\n",
        "Action is everything in this sinewy, visually impressive sci-fi military adventure!\n",
        "Soldier is little more than dumb genre stuff!\n",
        "Has there ever been a more insipid sci-fi action film than Soldier? Probably, although it's hard to imagine.\n",
        "Soldier is so mediocre, it might have been more mindless fun if it had been even worse.\n",
        "Soldier doesn't work, although it has potential.\n",
        "It's a big, clanging, brutal, actioner in which we search the murk in vain for the sparks of humanity the moviemakers keep promising us.\n",
        "A waste of snappy set decoration!\n",
        "With a cheerful disregard for characterization and visual texture, Anderson relies on his cgi-jocks and set dressers to flesh out David Webb Peoples's by-the-numbers script.\n",
        "When it comes to details like plot, character development, and genuine excitement, the film is lost in space.\n",
        "The action is strictly routine.\n",
        "Valkyrie, as field-commanded by director Bryan Singer, succeeds on its own terms as a handsome hybrid of conspiracy thriller and history lesson, of Mission: Impossible and The Day of the Jackal.\n",
        "As old-fashioned historical escapism goes, this is solid, compelling stuff.\n",
        "Surely there is some middle ground between a history lesson and mindless action-adventure. The people who made Valkyrie not only didn't find that ground; they weren't even looking for it.\n",
        "It is a well-made film that raises timeless questions about the demands of military duty when they are placed in conflict with higher principles.\n",
        "What if this lesser-known chapter of German resistance had been more deeply captured? What if the moral conflicts running through this movie about love of country and revolt said more about Germany, war and, yes, genocide?\n",
        "Singer keeps the conspiracy racing to its fated conclusion.\n",
        "As a suspense movie, this works pretty well.\n",
        "Valkyrie is made with impeccable professionalism and, flying in the face of years of Internet hysteria, is a perfectly acceptable motion picture. The only thing that keeps it from even greater accomplishments may be inherent in the story itself.\n",
        "The screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander introduces a seemingly endless series of characters, but there's no time to flesh any of them out enough to make you worry about their fate.\n",
        "Valkyrie doesn't whip you up like that Jewish vigilante avenger picture Defiance, but in this season of throat-grabbing Holocaust movies, its gentlemanliness is most welcome.\n",
        "Valkyrie transforms World War II into a boy's adventure.\n",
        "There are some powerful moments and [it's] an interesting true story.\n",
        "Everybody is I think is good in the film, except Tom Cruise.\n",
        "The problem is not that we know the outcome. The problem is the buildup.\n",
        "You just can't quite enter the world of this film, not in the way that you might have if a more nuanced and less iconic actor had played the central role.\n",
        "Mr. Cruise's performance turns out to be brisk and reasonably plausible, though unexceptional, while the production as a whole succeeds as an elaborate procedural, impressively staged in historical locations.\n",
        "Valkyrie is a brutally efficient bit of storytelling, and it makes no unforced errors.\n",
        "Think of Valkyrie as a reasonably entertaining drama about the time Tom Cruise tried to kill Hitler. Do that, and it becomes possible to enjoy the movie.\n",
        "What you miss in both Defiance and Valkyrie is inner conflict. Their protagonists have not an instant of self-doubt. They're figures in historical pageants, not characters in a drama.\n",
        "The movie... fails by the standards of $100 million Hollywood star action vehicles, and by the standards of World War II Oscar-bait epics. But by the standards of anticipated career-crushing trainwrecks, it's pretty good.\n",
        "Yes, there are heaps of charm and poignancy in this trifle, but it's a trifle nonetheless -- light-and-bright, for sure, but also slight-and-trite.\n",
        "Its sentiment is inescapable, but genuine poignancy and pathos are also present, and an overarching sincerity is visible too.\n",
        "Benigni certainly knew the risk he was taking with his idea, but the circumstances overwhelm him.\n",
        "It's a high-wire act without a net, and Benigni pulls it off with astounding grace and sensitivity.\n",
        "Sentimentality is a kind of fascism too, robbing us of judgment and moral acuity, and it needs to be resisted. Life Is Beautiful is a good place to start.\n",
        "Life is Beautiful has come under attack in some circles for mocking the Holocaust. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n",
        "he film's absurdist account of fascism gives the first half rich comic flavors that grow darker as the story progresses.\n",
        "Art-house sentimentalists will likely go for Beautiful in a big way, but even those who aggressively resist manipulation can find a lot to admire.\n",
        "The picture doesn't work, at least not to the extent it was intended to.\n",
        "The lesson that Benigni ultimately imparts is that it's easy to convince a child horror doesn't exist as long as it stays out of the way while the two of you are goofing off.\n",
        "Roberto Benigni's comic fable about one family's struggle to survive in a Nazi concentration camp is in offensively poor taste.\n",
        "In the real death camps there would be no role for Guido. But Life Is Beautiful is not about Nazis and Fascists, but about the human spirit.\n",
        "dares to laugh in the face of the unthinkable. And because Benigni can be heart-rending without a trace of the maudlin, it works.\n",
        "Benigni's movie made me want to throw up.\n",
        "You'll laugh! You'll cry! You'll smile through the evils of genocide!\n",
        "A strenuous effort to be an inventive comedy with perversely wicked humor, this midnight movie (premiering at Toronto Fest) showcases the talents of Trey Parker as writer-director-star; hopefully, his next film will be more successful\n",
        "Harrison never quite transcends the inherently limited format.\n",
        "hanks to casting that is savvier than the horror norm, and to direction by John Harrison that is workmanlike and sometimes even witty, at least it's fun.\n",
        "This is just another miss along the lines of Creepshow and Twilight Zone: The Movie.\n",
        "Norton is an amazing actor, a hot-dog whose delight in transformation is infectious.\n",
        "Two things hold the interest: Norton's astounding performance, and a feeling for the male reality of reactionary working class environments.\n",
        "The problem is that Kaye, who's used to selling cars on TV, shoots Derek the Hater as lovingly as he would a new Volkswagen.\n",
        "What partly redeems American History X from its most preachy excesses -- and makes it worth seeing -- is a brilliant, career-high performance by actor Edward Norton.\n",
        "Though well-intentioned, turns out to be a simplistic and unconvincing look at a serious problem.\n",
        "The tone is so muddled that there's a whiff of exploitation to this movie that's unsettling at best.\n",
        "The film is always interesting and sometimes compelling, and it contains more actual provocative thought than any American film on race since Do the Right Thing.\n",
        "This jolting, superbly acted film will draw serious-minded upscale viewers interested in cutting-edge fare and the latest outstanding performance by Edward Norton.\n",
        "When Hollywood attacks a volatile issue, it inevitably spoon-feeds you the main components of the issue several times over.\n",
        "A compelling, if somewhat choppy, tragic drama!\n",
        "Kaye wants to say something about what produces a skinhead today, and though he doesn't succeed fully in this endeavor, he does take us a significant part of the way.\n",
        "American History X may be flawed, but it's not easily forgotten.\n",
        "An intelligently provocative film!\n",
        "American History X has enough fiery acting and provocative bombast to make its impact felt!\n",
        "Riveting!\n",
        "A very good film with some dazzling moments and one truly outstanding performance!\n",
        "Shockingly powerful!\n",
        "This journey to unpleasantville is too often manipulative and strains to maintain tension.\n",
        "The ending is a misfire.\n",
        "American History X pulls open the wound of American racism and peers inside!\n",
        "On the one hand, the Hands on a Hard Body contest seems a horrible exploitation of needy people as a publicity stunt to promote a car dealership; on the other, the film reveals an endearing piece of Americana.\n",
        "Scrappy, likable, and immensely absorbing.\n",
        "These may not be people whom moviegoers think they want to spend time with, but this is accomplished documentary making, finding universal lessons in determination, struggle, planning, persistence and the relationship of mind and body.\n",
        "Bindler's attitude is absolutely right. He doesn't satirize: he observes, and leaves the satirical view as an option for us.\n",
        "It's engaging as a non-drama of people doing nothing, but suffering a lot.\n",
        "This feminist comedy shot through with fantasies about the travails of newly single womanhood strikes some rich chords, but doesn't quite put together a complete tune.\n",
        "McKellen, nevertheless, provides plenty of electricity -- even if the monster never quite gets off the table and walks.\n",
        "It's difficult to sustain a responsible subtext when you're delivering the jolts required to keep butts in the seats.\n",
        "Even at its most unbelievable, The Siege has the performances of Washington and Bening to fall back on, and a theme that understands that what's difficult is not choosing right from wrong but 'choosing the wrong that's more right.'\n",
        "The Siege is many things at once: tense, exciting, disturbing, and thought provoking.\n",
        "[Benning] is the only fresh, compelling character in the film.\n",
        "Just about distinguishable from several dozen predecessors in the same apocalyptic vein.\n",
        "Washington and Ms. Bening play smart, interesting characters who never quite connect, while Willis turns himself into the loosest military cannon this side of Dr. Strangelove.\n",
        "The prejudicial attitudes embodied in the film are insidious, like the anti-Semitism that infected fiction and journalism in the 1930s--not just in Germany, but in Britain and America.\n",
        "Typical summer popcorn fare.\n",
        "The script is too muddled to be remedied by vigorous filmmaking.\n",
        "The Siege is clumsily put together. Zwick is careless about plot details, so the movie is often needlessly confusing.\n",
        "The formulaic mix of mirth and mayhem is aimed way down the MTV food chain...\n",
        "The direction is as blunt and vacant as the plotting, the jokes are obvious and the performances (with a couple of exceptions) charmless.\n",
        "The film is amiably goofy.\n",
        "As a satire on the only true religion of the American South -- football -- The Waterboy is delightful.\n",
        "We've got somewhat entertaining trash here.\n",
        "Sandler makes the laughs go down easy, even if The Waterboy isn't exactly quality H2O.\n",
        "A character whose manner and voice has the effect of fingernails on a blackboard!\n",
        "You can lead Adam Sandler fans to \"The Waterboy,\" but you can't make them think.\n",
        "Dehydrated!\n",
        "As a whole, it's not so much stupid as it is boring.\n",
        "The trailer for 'The Waterboy' contains anything and everything from the film that might captivate an audience-the rest is just chafe.\n",
        "It's definitely for the fans!\n",
        "The peculiar comic energy of Sandler's idiot character gets lost because he's off screen for a good deal of the movie.\n",
        "Formulaic!\n",
        "The Waterboy is arguably Sandler's most enjoyable motion picture to date, but it's still far from a masterpiece.\n",
        "A series of quickly repetitious sight gags!\n",
        "Long on crude, cheap humor and short on, well, anything else.\n",
        "This escapist comedy is so cheerfully outlandish that it's hard to resist, and so good-hearted that it's genuinely endearing.\n",
        "Without [Blanchett], Kapur's extravagant history lesson (written by Michael Hirst) blurs into dark doings among men in tights.\n",
        "\"Elizabeth\" is superior historical soap opera that shrewdly sidesteps all the cliches of British costume drama with its bold, often modern approach.\n",
        "Kapur cunningly confuses gender roles, equates sex with death, and rattles through dark, stony passions with some considerable panache.\n",
        "It's almost guaranteed to get a couple of Oscar nominations in the technical categories, and I think Blanchett deserves one, too.\n",
        "This followup to last year's successful teens-in-jeopardy opus piles on the chills, thrills and body count.\n",
        "Our enjoyment is supposed to lie in making fun of the obvious red herrings, contrived opportunities to show cleavage, melodramatic dialogue, gullible characters, and inevitable to-be-continued ending.\n",
        "Irredeemably dire.\n",
        "Neither Trey Callaway, who wrote the script, nor Danny Cannon, who directed the sequel, bring any new ideas to the genre. Cut 'em some slack: That surely was their marching orders.\n",
        "It's not a bad film for what it is.\n",
        "When Bad Things Happen to Stupid People might have been a better title.\n",
        "A lazy, hasty effort that offers little beyond a few jack-in-the-box startles and a high body count, including Hewitt's bouncing about in a shirt half-unbuttoned over a bikini top.\n",
        "Merely a fairly silly and ultra-gory schlocker/shocker.\n",
        "A box office-driven sequel that re-hashes the already-tired approach and storyline of its predecessor.\n",

        "The movie's R rating mentions 'intense terror violence and gore,' but only its publicity team could consider it intense or terrifying. Gore it has.\n",
        "This family comedy finds unearned laughs in old women and dog flatulence.\n",
        "Arrogance gives way to humility, making this an appropriate, if thoroughly cliched, Christmas morality tale that's sugar-coated with an attractive cast spouting sitcom-quality dialogue.\n",
        "None of the cast comes off well, but they have little to work with, since the dialogue sounds like it was made up on the spot and performed without rehearsal.\n",
        "A Christmas turkey.\n",
        "Adequate in every way and oddly subversive in spots, but that's about it.\n",

        "Somehow one leaves aside the blatant implausibilities, the coincidences, even Eric Roberts, and takes great pleasure in a breakneck ride to the end of the line.\n",
        "The nihilism and the vicious intensity of Mr. Voight's performance here are entirely different from anything else he has done on screen; it's a shame those qualities emerge in such a vigorous but disjointed film.\n",

        "None of it appears to be well thought out, or thought through, and it's consequently never remotely believable.\n",
        "Henceforth, I fear Stepford may acquire new metaphorical implications. It will mean interesting old movies remade into lobotomized new ones.\n",
        "A great Provincetown drag show of The Stepford Wives.\n",
        "Before it degenerates into a complete mess, it's an entertaining mess, and something about its willingness to please maintains the audience's goodwill throughout.\n",
        "If the film is to work on any level, even a comedic one, it's necessary for the viewers to sympathize with Joanna and Walter. However, the script and scattershot performances keep them at arm's length.\n",
        "A comedy that's just too erratic and goofy to qualify as satire.\n",
        "It's the supporting actors who are the most fun.\n",
        "Its tonal schizophrenia gets the best of it -- the material careens wildly between sly comedy and creeping suspense, with some ill-advised detours into Borscht-belt humor.\n",

        "Sid and Nancy is the definitive pic on the punk phenomenon.\n",
        "A few too many moralistic foreshadowings, but most of the time Cox's situations and characters develop on their own eloquently entropic terms.\n",
        "Why then should anyone of sane disposition wish to see the film? Because it is still a love story, and a very touching one at that.\n",
        "It's not every film maker who credits special thanks to both Luis Bunuel and Dee Dee Ramone, but then Mr. Cox doesn't fit any recognizable mold.\n",
        "[Cox] and his actors pull off the neat trick of creating a movie full of noise and fury, and telling a meticulous story right in the middle of it.\n",
        "The only thing that is sustained in Sid and Nancy is a tone of clinical disinterest that leaves you asking why Cox would want to make a movie about them.\n",
        "Though dark and harrowing, explicit and unsparing, the movie proves a riveting biography of these burnt-out icons and their iconoclastic half-decade.\n",

        "Like the turtleneck cashmere sweaters and girdles that tie down these promising women, the movie is trite and trussed.\n",
        "Rather than being a fascinating exploration of a much more constrained time in our social history, the film simply feels anachronistic.\n",
        "[Roberts] is an anachronistic pop-feminist on a mission.\n",
        "There seems to be an odd idealization, or trivialization, of the characters that makes the movie ultimately unsatisfying.\n",

        "Sanctimonious, relentlessly predictable and willfully ignorant of the period it's set in.\n",
        "This is not a feminist movie. It even feels at times like a step back, partly because the cliches are so tired.\n",
        "There are a few reasons to enjoy the film, namely its likable cast, its noble aim -- of dramatizing one of the many small steps that led to the overhaul of women's higher education -- and its unexpected ability to surprise you.\n",
        "A Dead Poets Society for girls, substituting Roberts' luminosity for Robin Williams' mania.\n",
        "Such a mixed-up child, but not without worthy intentions and glimmers of realized potential -- sorry, but I just can't bring myself to come down too hard.\n",
        "An under-achieving film about how much women can achieve, featuring actors of such potential, seems more than a bit cynical even by Hollywood standards.\n",
        "A classy, handsome and serviceable entertainment that may not change your life, but could help you appreciate how you came to have it.\n",
        "The movie is all over the map, trying whatever seems to work at the moment.\n",
        "The film is caught somewhere between seriousness and cheesy exploitation.\n",
        "In 1957, Fellini was still as indebted to neo-realism as to surrealism, and this melancholy tale of a prostitute working the outskirts of Rome is notable for its straightforward depiction of destitution.\n",
        "What makes the character so poignant is that her final fortification is not her street wisdom -- that's all surface -- but her innocence. Her ultimate protection is our sympathy for her.\n",
        "Even in the mutilated version of the film, Masina shone and sparkled in her shabby role.\n",
        "Through [Masina's] unforgettable performance, Cabiria will endure as long as anyone cares to watch transcendence projected on a screen.\n",
        "The gift of Cabiria's essence, freed from the determinism of stories, is to return us to our own.\n",
        "Masina is immensely touching, through an extraordinary range of emotions.\n",
        "As artificial as Cabiria's behavior sometimes seems, it always seems her own, and this little woman carries herself proudly through the gutters of Rome.\n",
        "The most perfectly beautiful and touching of Fellini's movies.\n",
        "It's fascinating. Part of the fascination is in seeing how much of it is intrinsic, untarnished gold; and, as with most earlier works of masters, part of it now is in seeing the hints of the Fellini to come.\n",
        "A deep, wrenching and eloquent filmgoing experience.\n",
        "One of the finest collaborations between husband and wife ever committed to film.\n",
        "Characters are generally middle-of-the-roaders, and pic lacks a tough-minded spokesman who might bring them all up short for a moment.\n",
        "An irresistibly satisfying cultural artifact.\n",
        "There is no place for depth or nuance in this slickly engineered complacency machine.\n",
        "Funny and ferociously smart.\n",
        "It's perceptive, affectionate and often very funny.\n",
        "It has all the right moves. It knows all the right words. Its characters have all the right clothes, expressions, fears, lusts and ambitions. But there's no payoff and it doesn't lead anywhere.\n",
        "The performances represent ensemble playing of an order Hollywood films seldom have time for, with the screenplay providing each character with at least one big scene.\n",
        "[Its] spirited action is balanced by an almost contemplative attitude toward surveillance phobias and the movie cliches they've spawned.\n",
        "Add Smith's lippy innocent and a host of subcontracted indie fresh faces, and you have the Bruckheimer formula: loud, lavish, seemingly efficient; over-large, over-long, over-plotted. Safe and sorry.\n",
        "Since Scott could not make this film snap, crackle or pop faster or more loudly, you might find the evening a bit light.\n",
        "Hard to sit through.\n",
        "From there, with the mystery entirely gone and the thrills fading fast, the rest is pretty much a two-hour chase sequence, culminating in a hilariously maladroit shoot-out.\n",
        "What do you say about a movie that sends you home in a frenzy to search for bugs? In the new age of Big Brother, that's entertainment.\n",
        "Practically an elder statesman compared to the technobrats Bruckheimer usually employs, Scott also pays attention to the acting and it pays off.\n",
        "It has a hurtling pace, nonstop intensity and a stylish, appealing performance by Will Smith!\n",
        "The movie is fast-paced, centered around two big chase scenes, and ending in a clever double-cross that leads to a big shootout.\n",
        "An exciting if often overheated thriller!\n",
        "How idiotic!\n",
        "A solid two hours of pure, escapist entertainment.\n",
        "Watching this movie is like being wired to a TV set on permanent channel-surf mode!\n",
        "A briskly paced actioner!\n",
        "My mistake was bringing my head into the theater in the first place.\n",
        "The net result is fairly low-tension yet satisfyingly off-kilter.\n",
        "Another hackneyed, high-concept action flick!\n",
        "A high-adrenaline, high-concept action thriller!\n",
        "If the creation of paranoia is entertainment, Enemy of the State works.\n",
        "It actually wears you out after a while. Just like Scott's other movies, this one plays more like a hugely conceived wind-sprint. Rest periods are few and far between.\n",
        "Makes little effort to reach beyond its target audience.\n",
        "The dialogue reproduces infantile idiom even as it parodies the baby talk of adults, and a touching, didactic scene involving a baby blanket that's become the object of sibling rivalry may appeal to a broad age range.\n",
        "Those unfamiliar with the series will have a chance to marvel at Klasky and Csupo's refreshing innovations: their affectionate play with traditional presentations of 'sweet' baby behaviour and 'pretty' toddler looks.\n",
        "Although it works on two levels, one thing makes it work for any age: the sense of the id unloosed.\n",
        "It's a fun-filled oddity among G- rated animated movies. But some folks may conclude that the babies' creators have gone off the deep end to satisfy a '90s sensibility that favors edgy entertainment.\n",
        "What is most likely to impress adults is that the world of the Rugrats is not idealized or homogenized.\n",
        "Is it bright, colorful and fast-moving? Yes. Is it for me? No.\n",
        "An embarrassingly juvenile production that would seem more at home in the midst of Saturday morning cartoons than on a big screen.\n",
        "The pleasant surprise is that the film is a delight.\n",
        "A Bug's Life may be the single most amazing film I've ever seen that I couldn't fall in love with.\n",
        "This animated fable teems with vivid creatures standing on their own countless feet.\n",
        "The plot matures handsomely; the characters neatly converge and combust; the gags pay off with emotional resonance.\n",
        "Full of adventure, spectacle, light romance, and the kind of suspense that doesn't require an unpredictable outcome to make your spine tingle.\n",
        "Pixel perfect.\n",
        "One of the great movies -- a triumph of storytelling and character development, and a whole new ballgame for computer animation.\n",
        "The Lawrence of Arabia of bug movies.\n",
        "What A Bug's Life demonstrates is that when it comes to bugs, the most fun ones to hang out with hang exclusively with the gang at Pixar.\n",
        "Entertaining and Enchanting!\n",
        "I enjoyed the use of animation to visualize a world that could not be seen in live action and could not be created with special effects.\n",
        "The giddiest, most inventive family movie of the year!\n",
        "Even more fun than Antz!\n",
        "The little kids' version of Antz: sweeter, funnier, simpler to follow.\n",
        "Clever as it is, the film lacks charm.\n",
        "If this movie doesn't make you smile you may not know how.\n",
        "More than anything, it just looks incredible. It's impossible not to be utterly blown away by Pixar's animation.\n",
        "The best ant colony movie of the year!\n",
        "A Bug's Life, like Toy Story, develops protagonists we can root for, and places them in the midst of a fast-moving, energetic adventure.\n",
        "Lasseter and Pixar broke new technical and aesthetic ground in the animation field with Toy Story, and here they surpass it in both scope and complexity of movement while telling a story that overlaps Antz in numerous ways.\n",
        "As beautiful as it is wrenching.\n",
        "The movie's success rests largely on the shoulders of Fernanda Montenegro, an actress who successfully defeats any temptation to allow sentimentality to wreck her relationship with the child.\n",
        "its blatantly manipulative pairing of an adorable young boy and a selfish, honesty-challenged older woman ... so calculating that I could never get emotionally involved.\n",
        "It'll probably work better if you're not terribly familiar with the movies that inspired it.\n",
        "Salles directs simply and watchfully, with an eye that seems to penetrate all the characters who are encountered on Dora's and Josue's journey.\n",
        "Central Station is both literate and emotionally-powerful -- an increasingly rare combination.\n",
        "Fernanda Montenegro gives a landmark performance in the Brazilian film Central Station.\n",
        "What gives the film its strength is that cutting away the first layer only reveals more levels of toughness; it takes time to discover the pure soul beneath.\n",
        "[Salles'] imagery, like his storytelling, is clear, often unaffectedly lovely, and quietly, powerfully haunting.\n",
        "A richly tender and moving experience.\n",
        "A genial, feel-good item.\n",
        "Though it strives for broad humor, pushing cuteness and light irony, this bland 1998 movie isn't exactly a comedy.\n",
        "Charming performances and easygoing humour are the strengths of Jones's enjoyable Oirish romp.\n",
        "Completely delightful movie.\n",
        "Breezy little comedy.\n",
        "There is some nudity in Ned Devine, but it's the funniest nudity in movies in ages.\n",
        "If this film doesn't make you want to smile, you've no one to blame but yourself.\n",
        "It's instructive that Waking Ned Devine is being so aggressively sold as a feel-good comedy; the \"good\" feeling in question is called condescension.\n",
        "Although his movie is not entirely without substance (themes about religion, morality, and spirituality abound, as one can guess from the title character's name), it's basically designed to allow the audience to have fun.\n",
        "Another one of those delightful village comedies that seem to spin out of the British isles annually.\n",
        "Perfectly competent new Irish working-class comedy.\n",
        "Delightful.\n",
        "Waters works best with some restrictions on his license. He's much better as a subversive than he is an anarchist.\n",
        "I am not giving a star rating to Pink Flamingos, because stars simply seem not to apply. It should be considered not as a film but as a fact, or perhaps as an object.\n",
        "This well-meaning disaster, rescued from the obscurity it surely craves, is without doubt a candidate for one of the worst films ever made.\n",
        "It isn't quite a camp classic, although it's dreadful enough to have a certain comic appeal. ''Glen or Glenda'' is also a film of great conviction in its way, and that tends to interfere with the fun.\n",
        "While the acting is hit-and-miss and the story jumps around somewhat confusingly, Honda's film is a one-of-a-kind experience all the way through, one that stands the test of time better than I had expected.\n",
        "Clever storytelling manages to confront tragedy from any number of angles, and sometimes swinging at it from the side can be the most affecting.\n",
        "Honda's satire is cutting, with several characters resigned to living with the threat of constant cataclysm.\n",
        "Seen afresh in this cut, with Honda's pulp poetry restored, this ballad of destruction reveals itself as one of the most exciting, enjoyable and moving of them all.\n",
        "Honda may not have created the most convincing-looking monster in cinema history, but he managed to give his sci-fi/horror movie a social relevance, particularly in postwar Japan.\n",
        "The rampaging reptile is back to remind us that monsters have meaning.\n",
        "Maybe it's 50 years late, but we're finally getting to see Godzilla as it was meant to be seen.\n",
        "Rialto ... has done a commendable job of putting the picture back together, while adding fresh subtitles that occasionally mystify.\n",
        "This is a bad movie, but it has earned its place in history, and the enduring popularity of Godzilla and other monsters shows that it struck a chord.\n",
        "It's less of a monster movie and more of a morality play about the dangers of nuclear experimentation.\n",
        "Godzilla has never looked as good as in Honda's original conception, and few sci-fi creatures have equaled the size or impact of its first footsteps.\n",
        "The most emotionally authentic fake monster movie ever made.\n",
        "A great boon to monster movie fans, but will have limited appeal to others.\n",
        "Political charge elevates Godzilla far above its reputation for cheesiness, but not so far that it should be mistaken for political satire.\n",
        "Morally compelling aspects of Honda's film lost to Americans are now restored.\n",
        "There's a surprisingly powerful thrust to this film.\n",
        "Its images of the destruction of the cities is far more powerful than in American films, where the cities are trashed for the pure pleasure of destruction, without any real sense of human loss.\n",
        "An interesting exercise in nostalgia as well as an informative look at the origins of a sci-fi giant who's stamped through nearly 30 films.\n",
        "Can now be appreciated not just as a minor classic of tragic destruction, but also as a somber exploration of conflicted postwar emotions.\n",
        "A collective metaphor and a collective nightmare, a message film that says more than its message, that captures, with a horrified poetry, the terrors that stomped through the minds of people 50 years ago.\n",
        "The one mild surprise of this cheap reprise of earlier Hollywood and Japanese horror films is the ineptitude of its fakery.\n",
        "It clocks in at over three hours, but Peter Jackson's remake of the 1933 classic is gripping nonetheless.\n",
        "It takes a while to get everybody to Skull Island, about 70 minutes, but it's time extremely well-spent.\n",
        "Kong is a showy, state-of-the-art popcorn movie, faithful to the spirit of the 1933 original but generously adrenalized with the best effects money can buy.\n",
        "Our response to the ape's doom, once touched by authentic tragedy, is now marked by relief that this wretchedly excessive movie is finally over.\n",
        "Kong has heart, and he's willing to show it in a movie made with wit, excitement and moments of visionary beauty.\n",
        "King Kong isn't terrible, but it's something that none of Jackson's previous movies ever was -- it's enervating.\n",
        "Jackson took a huge risk with King Kong. But the movie that no film lover wanted him to make is sure to become the blockbuster that everyone is going to want to see, and with good reason.\n",
        "One hundred eighty-seven minutes of mesmerization, astonishment, thrills, chills, spills, kills and ills, Peter Jackson's big monkey picture show is certainly the best popular entertainment of the year.\n",
        "The unrelenting computer-animated action suffocates what seems to have been the movie's main purpose, to expand on the Kong-Ann relationship.\n",
        "Although King Kong is spectacular, its power doesn't reside in its glittering vision of 1933 Manhattan, Jackson's virtuoso flourishes or his computer-generated effects. It's so much simpler: When the gorilla touches the girl, he touches our hearts.\n",
        "It starts too slowly and suffers from weak dialogue and less-than-epic acting. But as popcorn movies go, this is the year's popcorniest.\n",
        "Silly, pointless and obscenely overproduced.\n",
        "Serkis' contribution truly is something we've never seen, an entirely new category of computer-enhanced acting. With not a word of dialogue, he brings to life a close cousin to man with whom we can empathize, yet is never too human-like.\n",
        "There are some dazzling moments and remarkably clunky ones, a stitched together mixture of old and new, a genre tour that jumps in tone from jaunty comedy to sci-fi horror to laboured social commentary.\n",
        "Good things do come in big packages. The trick for any filmmaker is to find the small movie within the big one, which is exactly what Peter Jackson does in King Kong.\n",
        "It's the rare kind of movie that makes too much seem like a good idea.\n",
        "In a word, Jackson's King Kong is spectacular, awesome, phenomenal and breathtaking. OK, so I can't boil it down to one word.\n",
        "At three hours, Jackson's Kong is too bloated and digressive to match the pure adrenaline of the first film, perhaps the finest B-movie ever made.\n",
        "There's no denying the monumentality of Jackson's achievement, which intermittently lives up to Denham's showbiz credo: 'Magic for the price of a ticket.'\n",
        "Too big for its own good, too pure of heart to diminish, brawling, magnificent, heroic and flawed: That's King Kong, and that's King Kong.\n",
        "King Kong Lives ... has a dull cast and a plot that's even duller, but the ape himself is in good form.\n",
        "All of this is cause for consistent smiling and a few outright laughs, without ever building to complete comedy.\n",
        "The film acquires a pleasant, syncopated rhythm as it bounces from one unlikely event to another.\n",
        "Even if the plotting (a mistaken identity farce involving that old chestnut, amnesia brought on by a bump to the head) is square as a square peg. Madonna has never found a better fit than the role of Susan.\n",
        "It has its moments, and many of them involve the different kinds of special appeal that Arquette and Madonna are able to generate.\n",
        "A breezy, peppy frolic and a tour de force for Chase.\n",
        "Michael Ritchie's 1985 mystery comedy has the pleasant, modest feel of a Fox B picture from the 30s.\n",
        "This could be Bob Hope material c1942 and Chase does acquit himself well (though with cool reserve) in the gags-to-plot transitions. What dulls the enterprise is that Ritchie so keeps his distance from every character.\n",
        "Whenever the move threatens to work, there's Chevy Chase with his monotone, deadpan cynicism, distancing himself from the material.\n",
        "A lightweight, breezy experience that, by never pretending to be anything more than what it is, disarms criticism.\n",
        "Its tone swings violently from pratfall to preachment, from an indictment of featherbed laziness to an extended beer-commercial celebration of the mythical American worker.\n",
        "Drawn from real life, the conflict between cultures is good for both a laugh and a sober thought along the way.\n",
        "The hero, though funny, is ultimately unsympathetic, securing through his cosy pacts nobody's position but his own, while the upbeat ending justifies strike-breaking. With comrades like this, who needs class enemies?\n",
        "It's more cheerful than funny, and so insistently ungrudging about Americans and Japanese alike that its satire cuts like a wet sponge.\n",
        "A disappointment, a movie in which the Japanese are mostly used for the mechanical requirements of the plot, and the Americans are constructed from durable but boring stereotypes.\n",
        "This one, directed by John Glen, just follows the numbers, plodding from one unimaginative set piece to the next.\n",
        "It is exhausted and exhausting, an old joke retold once too often.\n",
        "While Bond pics have always traded heavily on the camp value of its characters, A View to a Kill almost attacks the humor, practically winking at the audience with every move.\n",
        "Once 007 was licensed to kill; now he not only eats quiche, he cooks it himself.\n",
        "As lavishly escapist as they are, the latest James Bond films have become strenuous to watch, now that the business of maintaining Bond's casual savoir-faire looks like such a monumental chore.\n",
        "A View to a Kill is often numbered among the worst of the series, but, upon closer inspection, this film is a vast improvement over Octopussy.\n",
        "It's perfectly serviceable.\n",
        "Script is merely a collection of gags tied together by the slightest suggestion of a story.\n",
        "More of the same from the wackiest police force on the streets, and their newly recruited civilian helpers.\n",
        "The new players, like the original ones (who are still here in full force), are limited to one-shtick roles and are sometimes even more limited than that.\n",
        "Just when you think American film comedy has hit the bottom of the barrel, it makes a supreme effort and keeps sinking.\n",
        "Miami field trip only brings a pastel backdrop to the insipid infighting of the boobs in blue.\n",
        "It's business as usual: fart jokes.\n",
        "The real culprit is producer Paul Maslansky, the creator of the Academy films, clearly a man who can never be stopped, not even by a SWAT team of movie critics with blood in their eyes.\n",
        "It's George Miller's masterpiece, maybe even the best commercial film of 1998.\n",
        "Darkly funny!\n",
        "So distressingly dark, grim, and cynical it's likely to make kids cry!\n",
        "A sequel that lacks the quiet beauty and subtlety of the original!\n",
        "More magical than the original!\n",
        "Brilliant!\n",
        "The new saga basks in imaginative charm!\n",
        "BABE has all but lost its bearings.\n",
        "Berg is so in love with his escalating shock tactics that they quickly cease to shock.\n",
        "...hollow, simple-minded and about as profound an experience as stepping in a pile of road kill.\n",
        "Peter Berg's Very Bad Things isn't a bad movie, just a reprehensible one.\n",
        "...Berg's listless direction brings the film so little point of view that it doesn't much matter who lives or dies.\n",
        "The gross-out humor lacks edge, the guilt never kicks in, and the outrages are predictable. It's one flat brewski.\n",
        "It's entertaining to a degree, but lacks all of the elements necessary to form a truly compelling motion picture.\n",
        "...uneven but frequently funny...\n",
        "Berg ... brings wit, energy and a twisted kind of joy to a story that's little more than a tasteless anecdote.\n",
        "It's extremely lousy material, but these guys make the most of it.\n",
        "A small picture with a big heart.\n",
        "A lively if finally rather cruel comic fantasy.\n",
        "At its center is Jane Horrocks, who, in the title role, gives the best female performance of the year.\n",
        "Horrocks' gift for impersonation is remarkable. If her acting career ever stalls, she can take her singing act on the road. Her Garland impression alone would fill every gay bar in the world.\n",
        "Here everything leads up to (and wilts after) Horrocks' showstopper. But she is amazing. Absolutely fabulous.\n",
        "A Simple Plan is lean, elegant, and emotionally complex - a marvel of backwoods classicism.\n",
        "Perfect capers gone horribly, inexorably awry have always kept audiences squirming. But just when we think we've seen it all, Raimi offers a few new wrinkles.\n",
        "Raimi takes the old story about dishonour among thieves and renders it fresh through the calm, cool, steady assurance of the telling.\n",
        "As straightforward in narrative as it is gut-wrenching in effect, A Simple Plan is a sort of slow-motion skid down an icy blacktop- it's a movie you watch with a mounting sense of dread.\n",
        "Jack Frost is so treacly and fake it makes you feel like you're trapped in a winter-wonderland paperweight.\n",
        "Let it melt!\n",
        "No story, not enough humor, a silly setup, and a guy in the snowman suit who looks like he didn't make the first cut at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.\n",
        "A slickly packaged and engagingly sentimental fantasy-comedy that stands out as one of the season's most pleasant surprises!\n",
        "The snowman, which is the work of Jim Henson's Creature Shop, is the most glaring problem. It looks about as real as a man in a costume, and it's tough to suspend disbelief when you're trying to locate the zipper.\n",
        "Its heart is in the right place.\n",
        "Jack Frost oozes the kind of fake warmth that gives family films a bad name.\n",
        "Predictable!\n",
        "Now we have proof: It's possible for the Jim Henson folks and Industrial Light and Magic to put their heads together and come up with the most repulsive single creature in the history of special effects!\n",
        "Its sentiment is rote, its truths are culled from a trip down the aisles of a greeting-card shop.\n",
        "Formulaic and charmless!\n",
        "It's just cheerful and bogus enough to keep children reasonably entertained.\n",
        "A very minor parable on paying attention to family while you can, Frost offers a wide range of passing diversions, from snowboarding derring-do to a minimally annoying computerized title character to lots of tender snowman-son bonding moments.\n",
        "The extravagant makeup and special effects are actually unobtrusive because they're demanded by the pleasantly formulaic story, whose conflicts--and broad, innocuous political allegory -- justify the heartwarming resolution.\n",
        "Strikes a deft balance of predictable heroics and quirky humor.\n",
        "Despite the usual strained stabs at topical social significance, Frakes maintains a brisk pace, staging the battle scenes with panache and undercutting the absurd techno gibberish with crass but leavening humour.\n",
        "Fun for most folks, heaven for Trekkers.\n",
        "More of the the same-old -same-old.\n",
        "The latest and ninth installment in that line, Star Trek: Insurrection, lacks the adrenalized oomph of its predecessor, but no adventure of the Starship Enterprise is without its gee-whiz affability.\n",
        "An appealing millennial throwback to the hippie dream that is part and parcel of Star Trek's utopian ethos.\n",
        "The story has enough plot switchbacks, space battles and gizmo wizardry to ensure that most viewers won't forget the film until at least the next morning.\n",
        "In two outings as director, Jonathan Frakes has proven that he understands what makes Star Trek work on the big screen.\n",
        "Doesn't exactly boldly go where no one has gone before.\n",
        "Inert and unconvincing.\n",
        "The movie's proudest accomplishment is that it revises our version of Moses toward something more immediate and believable, more humanly knowable.\n",
        "This is sensational cinema: crowds swarming among pyramids in eye-popping 3-D, camerawork that's distinctly Spielbergian in its fluidity.\n",
        "The blend of animation techniques somehow demonstrates mastery modestly, while the special effects are nothing short of magnificent.\n",
        "As epic, emotionally satisfying spectacle, it's way up there with the very best in mainstream animation.\n",
        "The handsomely animated Prince of Egypt is an amalgam of Hollywood biblical epic, Broadway supermusical and nice Sunday school lesson.\n",
        "Takes itself too seriously.\n",
        "An inspiring translation of biblical grandeur, turning the story of one of history's greatest heroes into an entertaining, visually dazzling cartoon.\n",
        "The 400-member-strong Prince of Egypt team (led by directors Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells and ramrodded by executive producer Jeffrey Katzenberg) have created a succession of visual wonders.\n",
        "This movie is worth a trip to the local multiplex by viewers of all ages, races, and religious persuasions.\n",
        "It's sophisticated, both intellectually and morally!\n",
        "The Prince of Egypt is middlebrow kitsch, but kitsch straining for respectability and therefore without the energy that can make kitsch entertaining.\n",
        "The Prince of Egypt goes beyond fanciful and magical. It is the first spiritual animated film ever, as deep and resonant as it is soaringly inventive!\n",
        "A visually breathtaking film!\n",
        "A well-made work with much to recommend it!\n",
        "If The Prince of Egypt falls short in its song and story, it succeeds gloriously in its epic grandeur and visual splendor.\n",
        "Rather than Jerry Falwell, I'd have had the production vetted by Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks.\n",
        "The film lacks creative exuberance, any side pockets of joy.\n",
        "I wish DreamWorks had been more truly daring instead of merely competitive and worked a little longer at evolving a drawing style that departed more radically from the Disney house style than this film does.\n",
        "For a cartoon, the movie is overpowering!\n",
        "If de Mille had seen this film, he would have gone back to the drawing board!\n",
        "Schwartzman is cautious but stubbornly optimistic, while Murray is possessed by the mania of near-despair... They make the best and most disconcerting odd couple that American movies have produced in a long while.\n",
        "Rushmore is an almost indefinable genre of its own. A comedy with a menacing edge? An ironic romance? Hard to call. Anderson, the director and co-writer, and Wilson, co-writer, have a vision like no one else's.\n",
        "A quirky, sometimes hilarious and often touching comic fable.\n",
        "There's an unshakable confidence about this coming-of-age fable that matches that of its central character, Max Fischer.\n",
        "If happiness is finding something you love to do and doing it forever, one of my somethings might just be watching this oddly uproarious little flick.\n",
        "There's a danger of overselling Anderson's sweet-hearted, loony little fantasy, but everything -- from the soundtrack of '60s Brit bands with their jangly anthems of angsty love to Robert Yeoman's slightly hyper-real photography -- fits perfectly.\n",
        "An inspired second feature from director Wes Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson, the picture shares the offbeat rhythms and disarming humor of their overlooked debut, Bottle Rocket.\n",
        "One of the freshest, richest, most original films to come out of Hollywood in a very long time.\n",
        "The director treats eccentricity with compassionate respect: no winking, no nudges to even like the boy. The filmmaking, meanwhile, is beautifully disciplined.\n",
        "You also have to admire the creepy arrogance of Schwartzman's performance.\n",
        "What I wanted was a larger perspective, something more insightful than the one-thing-after-another existential whimsy.\n",
        "A wickedly funny high school comedy for most of its running time, Rushmore is a bracingly fresh and original outing.\n",
        "A peculiar, poignant comedy, with an outstanding character turn from Murray.\n",
        "This film is so not-from-the-cookie-cutter, so unaccommodating of our expectations, that we can't anticipate where Anderson's going to take us. Every scene is a discovery or sly diversion.\n",
        "A true original: a film that stands apart from the crowd, goes its own way and all but dares you not to like it.\n",
        "One of the most original, good-hearted comedies in a long time, Rushmore is the sort of movie where the strangest sequences of discords somehow keep managing to reach giddily improbable resolutions.\n",
        "To call Rushmore a romantic triangle about clinical depressives doesn't allow for the film's bracing humanism.\n",
        "...Anderson has an idiosyncratic sensibility, the rare ability to create a world that is completely his own. Unique worlds, however, can be off-putting enough to discourage civilians from spending time there.\n",
        "[Rushmore is] structured like a comedy, but there are undertones of darker themes, and I almost wish they'd allowed the plot to lead them into those shadows.\n",
        "[An] inordinately clever, sprightly romantic comedy.\n",
        "It restores to centrality of consciousness one of the great geniuses of our civilization. It makes us care for his greatness, for his passion, for his worth. In no uncertain terms, it tells us Willie Boy is still here.\n",
        "Scene after scene engages us as cheerful groundlings, tosses us jokes, toys with our expectations, then sweeps away the boundaries between film and stage, comedy and tragedy so we're open to the power of language and the feelings behind it.\n",
        "A triumph of talent and style over silliness.\n",
        "Hilarious, sexy, clever, playful and as initially teasing as it is ultimately satisfying.\n",
        "I just wish that the script wasn't so insistent on showing off. Shakespeare, even when he kowtowed to the peasants, knew when to quit.\n",
        "You can't miss with a movie that speaks the language of love with such hotblooded delight. And in iambic pentameter, too.\n",
        "In addition to Fiennes, who does a star-making job here, and the radiant Paltrow, Shakespeare in Love teems with wonderful performances.\n",
        "A ripely emotional comedy-fantasia.\n",
        "Accessible, entertaining and fun for modern audiences. Exquisitely acted, tightly directed and impressively assembled, this lively period piece is the kind of arty gem with potentially broad appeal that Miramax certainly knows how to sell.\n",
        "Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard have written one of the year's smartest scripts, and Mrs. Brown director John Madden gets a chance to show a funny side that's previously been submerged.\n",
        "It's easy to suspend disbelief and embrace this historically creative fiction, whose clever relationship to what's known and what's unresolved is part of what makes it so intriguing and so romantic.\n",
        "It's Tom Stoppard's witty, intelligent script which proves so satisfying.\n",
        "It's a literary burlesque, remarkably clever and quick on its feet. It is ardently romantic but is at its best when it is funny. And it's funny.\n",
        "Seems the Bard is badly blocked.\n",
        "A happy conceit smoothly executed, this is one of those entertaining confections that's so pleasing to the eye and ear you'd have to be a genuine Scrooge to struggle against it.\n",
        "If, for the playwright himself, all the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players, then this splendrous new movie gives as much of his world as a simple stage or screen can hold.\n",
        "With glittering shows of erudition and playfulness, Shakespeare in Love mixes history, fiction, comedy and romance to create a pure joy of a movie!\n",
        "I was carried along by the wit, the energy and a surprising sweetness.\n",
        "Like some of Shakespeare's own, unclassifiable plays that bounce between comedy and tragedy, it's a wonderful mess.\n",
        "Its plodding competence can't provide that effortless magical touch that Christmas classics are made of.\n",
        "Harrell's brash debut, the use of animism and the story's sincerity add interest.\n",
        "Smaller kids will identify with Jessica's fierce resolve to get Prancer back into action, and older viewers will appreciate the fact that the movie takes place in an approximation of the real world.\n",
        "A thoroughly unpleasant project, quite apart from its creepy populist posturing (Stallone seemed determined to become the Huey Long of the movies).\n",
        "The body count is rising, Sly's pecs are blowing up, and Rambo himself is becoming more of a brand-name than a character, a mascot for masochism and murderous self-assertion.\n",
        "To anyone who doesn't share the camera's adoration, this sort of behavior becomes so comic that Rambo turns into something of a camp classic.\n",
        "The darker tone, somber subtext, and generally non-exploitative violence allow viewers to enjoy the film not only as an action/thriller but as something with a degree of intelligence and substance.\n",
        "This action film hangs on an interesting reversal, taking the crazed-killer-in-the-woods theme from Friday the 13th and turning it inside out-- the psychopath is now our hero, a maladjusted ex-Green Beret played by Sylvester Stallone.\n",
        "Director Ted Kotcheff has all sorts of trouble with this mess, aside from credibility.\n",
        "As a Stallone vehicle this is sleek, slick and not unexciting, but crassly castrates the David Morrell novel on which it is based.\n",
        "Sylvester Stallone is one of the great physical actors in the movies, with a gift for throwing himself so fearlessly into an action scene that we can't understand why somebody doesn't really get hurt.\n",
        "First Blood is ragged and flashy; it ought to be a big success with audiences that value action for its own sake.\n",
        "Always at ground zero in the chaos is Rambo -- gloriously, inhumanly impervious to fear and danger -- whose character is inhabited by Stallone with messianic intensity.\n",
        "Saturday Morning Picture Club stuff, only dearer.\n",
        "Mr. Stallone has by now made Rambo parody-proof, since the character is every bit as laughable as he is grandiose; that's part of the fun.\n",
        "Rambo may, in fact, have outlived his usefulness. His moment may have passed.\n",
        "Stallone scripts the wall-to-wall explosions too haphazardly and unimaginatively.\n",
        "Turner is like a lot of unwitting screen heroines ahead of her, guaranteed that her drab existence is about to be transformed -- probably by a man, preferably handsome and adventurous.\n",
        "Director Robert Zemeckis displays such dazzling cinematic know-how that it's genuinely depressing when this 1984 film falls off into the usual self-ridicule.\n",
        "The script is sharp and funny, the direction sure-footed on both the comedy and action fronts, and the whole thing adds up to rather more concerted fun than Indiana Jones' flab-ridden escapade in the Temple of Doom.\n",
        "After all the Raiders rip-offs, it's fun to find an adventure film that deserves the comparison, that has the same spirit and sense of humor.\n",
        "An elaborately produced, mostly charmless adventure-comedy that intends to make fun of a kind of romantic fiction that's one step removed from what the movie is all about.\n",
        "An amiable, life-affirming fantasy-comedy about the rejuvenation of crotchery oldsters whose main distinction is offering roles to senior actors like Don Ameche (who won an Oscar), Hume Cronyn, and Jessica Tandy\n",
        "Cocoon weaves a mesmerizing tale.\n",
        "Director Ron Howard brings a quality of gentleness and whimsy to the performances, but basically this is a highly calculated project brought in by those two old pros, producers Richard Zanuck and David Brown.\n",
        "Essentially, this is sci-fi with a heart, albeit one made entirely of cheese.\n",
        "It has no real competition as this season's reigning fairy tale.\n",
        "Sylvester Stallone is really sloughing it off shamelessly in Rocky IV, but it's still impossible not to root for old Rocky Balboa to get up off the canvas and whup that bully one more time.\n",
        "The crazed flag-waving would be a lot easier to take if it weren't so clearly a commercial calculation meant to salvage what is otherwise a crass, careless, shamelessly padded film.\n",
        "Film reduced to the barest of three acts.\n",
        "Even the hint of political power that Rocky garners by the end of this latest battle is made to seem like more of the same empty glory.\n",
        "Even Sylvester Stallone seems to be getting tired of the series; as the writer and director, as well as the star, he puts himself through the same old paces.\n",
        "The dramatic moves are so obvious and shopworn that not even the star's mournful basset-hound expressions can redeem them.\n",
        "Whereas the first and far superior Rocky had real heart, this tries and fails to have brains.\n",
        "A sloppy but good-natured reminder of just what it is that has kept Rocky Balboa afloat for 14 years.\n",
        "In Rock V, the underdog is officially diagnosed as 'brain damaged.' Yo. So what else is new?\n",
        "Despite Stallone's bantamweight attempts to insert, like, character into the fifth Rocky, it's the same old fight with the same old round of regulars.\n",
        "It's not the least bit scary or suspenseful but instead quickly grows tedious. The more you struggle to keep track of the constantly multiplying plot developments, the harder it gets to care who did it.\n",
        "Only Lesley Ann Warren, as a tough-talking madam, finds an effective level of stylization, using her leggy physique and wildly expressive features to create a cartoonish figure that's funny within its own boundaries.\n",
        "The characters are less credible than their plastic counterparts, the puerile humour is dispiriting, and the plotting pulled this way and that by the conceit of releasing the film in the US with a trio of alternate endings.\n",
        "One ending is more than enough.\n",
        "Though it takes only 87 minutes to arrive at one of its three different solutions, it has long since worn out its welcome by the denouement.\n",
        "The vibes, here, are all wrong, and Dangerfield's unique timing is disrupted in most scenes.\n",
        "I mean no disrespect to Rodney Dangerfield in suggesting that Back to School is a comedy that belongs back on the drawing board.\n",
        "Dangerfield seems to be setting the film's brisk pace and flawless timing himself.\n",
        "In this very funny Rodney Dangerfield comedy, there has been an important shift in Rodney's entertainment persona, a shift that has made this small film a monster hit.\n",
        "It's a good character for Dangerfield, one that veers him away from the 'I don't get no respect' pathos that comes too easily to him, and enough attention is paid to the minimal plot to integrate Dangerfield's classically constructed one-liners.\n",
        "[An] acceptable time-passer.\n",
        "The film is a good-natured potpourri of gags, funny bits, populist sentiment and anti-intellectualism.\n",
        "This is exactly the sort of plot Marx or Fields could have appeared in. Dangerfield brings it something they might also have brought along: a certain pathos.\n",
        "This is the most disappointing film of the year, considering its pedigree -- a Mike Nichols film from a Nora Ephron script, starring Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson.\n",
        "This film's art consists entirely of hiding the cynicism of its calculations under an agreeably modest and disarming manner.\n",
        "Morita is simply terrific, bringing the appropriate authority and wisdom to the part.\n",
        "A surprise summer hit in the States, this is another film-making-by-numbers exercise in teenage wish-fulfilment.\n",
        "An exciting, sweet-tempered, heart-warming story with one of the most interesting friendships in a long time.\n",
        "The Karate Kid exhibits warmth and friendly, predictable humor, its greatest assets.\n",
        "It's primitive, predatory stuff.\n",
        "The pattern has so calcified that Gene Autry westerns seem like models of moral complexity by comparison.\n",
        "Solid family fare with plenty of yocks.\n",
        "The new film does little more than reintroduce these familiar characters (with new actors playing the children, who would otherwise be college age by now) and let them get on one another's nerves in earnest.\n",
        "One of the great unanswered questions in Hollywood is how Chevy Chase still gets work.\n",
        "Sequence after sequence seems to contain all the necessary material, to be well on the way toward a payoff, and then it somehow doesn't work.\n",
        "Christmas Vacation may not be a fancy package, but it is a diverting stocking stuffer.\n",
        "The coincidences that make the destined lovers' paths cross aren't contrived with much finesse, but the characters get in some decidedly clever lines.\n",
        "The clumsily loaded characterisation not only treats almost every other figure as dispensable, but doesn't even bother to make Meg and Tom properly sympathetic.\n",
        "Mail may not be as romantic as Sleepless, but it's wittier.\n",
        "A love story destined to be remembered as one of the best of the decade.\n",
        "Fully-stocked, well-oiled and soulless, You've Got Mail sure feels like a franchise operation -- all that's missing is a greeter and a discount card.\n",
        "Every time You've Got Mail is about to choke on its own cleverness, it's resuscitated by its extremely likable -- oh heck, let's just call them lovable -- stars.\n",
        "There's no denying the chemistry between Hanks, whose comparisons to Jimmy Stewart are becoming annoyingly accurate, and Ryan, whose schoolgirl cuteness is finally taking on a layer of matured confidence.\n",
        "Not only about PCs; it appears to have been dictated by one.\n",
        "Even if you already live on the Upper West Side, you might feel the urge to move there before the film is over.\n",
        "You've Got Mail provides a perfectly cuddly night at the movies!\n",
        "The whole movie goes bland and flat as a fast-food knish or a blank computer screen.\n",
        "Seductive!\n",
        "This film made me feel like a Christmas goose being fattened for slaughter. Its force-fed diet of whimsy cloyed long before the eagerly anticipated romantic payoff arrived to put me out of my misery.\n",
        "Ryan and Hanks have more winning smiles than most people have expressions!\n",
        "Like e-mail, this movie is a message delivery system, no more.\n",
        "Winning romantic comedy and great date movie!\n",
        "A sweetly sentimental romance that shrewdly capitalizes on the foolproof allure of its stars.\n",
        "It's a feel-good movie that offers enough comedy and romance to warm the heart without risking a sentimental overdose.\n",
        "Warm, smart, and funny!\n",
        "It lacks the freshness of the first film, but it's still a charmer.\n",
        "It's a genuinely epic cine-poem that essentially sidesteps history, politics and conventional ethics to deal with war as an absolute, inevitable and eternal facet of existence.\n",
        "Fascinating!\n",
        "A complex, highly talented work marked by intellectual and philosophical ambitions!\n",
        "A haunting, scattered reminiscence piece, where the mind is allowed to drift through its memories, and retrieve impressions of the beautiful and the hideous, the serene and the hysterical, the banal and the profound.\n",
        "The Thin Red Line is an epic aestheticization of World War II, a movie at once bold and baffling, immediate and abstract.\n",
        "An uncannily timed movie phenomenon!\n",
        "It wrestles with complexity, speaks to us in poetry, weaves multiple narrative strands into a tapestry, opens the festering wounds of war and gazes inside without blinking.\n",
        "One of the most curious and perversely brilliant films ever made!\n",
        "At two hours and 45 minutes, The Thin Red Line gives ample evidence of suffering all manner of cuts, if not having been simply hacked into its final shape. But this violence only adds to the movie's brave, strange, eroded nobility.\n",
        "Intermittently brilliant!\n",
        "Takes war to a stirring level!\n",
        "There has been no American film in 1998 with larger ambitions!\n",
        "Malick hasn't lost his knack for impressive visuals!\n",
        "This smart, involving sci-fi picture, set in an Ohio high school, pays homage to several genre faves, notably Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Thing.\n",
        "Since the codes of science fiction are different from horror's cant, the patented Williamson method doesn't make a perfect fit with the material; Faculty's fun, but less fun than it could be.\n",
        "Just whiskers away from being really snazzy, \"The Faculty\" still manages to make for a fun night out.\n",

        "Here is the year's least welcome technological advance, the computer-generated butterfly meant to provide a touch of magic for a film that has none of its own.\n",
        "A perfectly fine, play-it-safe vehicle for Robin Williams that showcases both his great gift for improvisational comedy and his ability to make a heartfelt connection.\n",
        "Instead of drama, Patch Adams gives us mere iconography, and wastes Williams's iconoclastic dedicated doc.\n",
        "A movie of depth and delight!\n",

        "When Susan Sarandon wants you to cry, you cry. When Julia Roberts wants you to smile, you smile.\n",
        "A very bland pudding!\n",
        "Not since 1979's Kramer vs. Kramer has a mainstream movie more accurately, insightfully, humorously or tear-jerkingly dramatized family life in our time than Stepmom!\n",
        "Never feels either real enough to move us deeply or bubbly enough to make us forget our woes.\n",
        "These two actresses are so galvanized and team up so well that the women's relationship soon upstages anything having to do with the man.\n",
        "It's a film that takes valid, complex family dynamics regarding divorce, remarriage, and parenting and reduces it all to bitchy catfighting, obvious button-pushing, and tawdry cliches.\n",
        "Too loud, bright and shallow for its subject!\n",
        "It's merely a soap opera with elevated production values and a sterling cast.\n",
        "The script is a mishmash of cliches, inferior melodrama, and howlingly embarrassing dialogue, and the director, Chris Columbus, shows no evidence that he understands the meaning of the term 'subtle'.\n",
        "Who knew Sarandon's headlight eyes and Roberts' high-beam smile would complement one another so well?\n",
        "Based on a true story, this is an intelligent legal thriller, very much in the mode of 1970s issue-oriented films, that may be too subtle and complex for the damands of today's market.\n",
        "Delivering the verdict two thirds into the movie is anti-climactic, while Schlichtmann's belated atonement feels beside the point.\n",
        "As proficient a job as writer-director Steve Zaillian and his team do, A Civil Action has unmistakably unraveled by its close.\n",
        "Travolta captures the complexity of a man whose motives for doing good have as much to do with vanity as anything else.\n",
        "The story presents both Schlichtmann and the civil court system as stubbornly complicated. And it tells a finely nuanced tale of right, wrong and the gray area in between.\n",
        "Zaillian managed to surprise me by crafting a courtroom drama which is sufficiently different and thought-provoking that I can recommend it with a clear conscience.\n",
        "A slick, shameless job that takes way too long to make its point (namely, we need the EPA).\n",
        "Millions of people read Harr's gripping bestseller, but Steven Zaillian may be the only one who didn't understand it.\n",
        "Like John Grisham for grownups.\n",
        "Schlichtmann may have gone through this conversion in real life, but I just didn't buy it the way Zaillian presents it.\n",
        "I'm all for films that don't flow from the usual Hollywood test tubes, but A Civil Action is basically the standard formula with a dash of downbeat.\n",
        "Hurlyburly earns its keep, in the end, with writerly flash and dramatic virtuosity.\n",
        "A tony biopic that manages to combine an upfront portrayal of the scribe's gayness with an often moving examination of his broader emotions and artistic ideals.\n",
        "If anybody was born to play Oscar Wilde, it must have been Stephen Fry: not only does he look like the Green Carnation Man, but he himself is often portrayed as being too clever, too complex for his own good.\n",
        "Likely to remain the definitive screen treatment of Oscar Wilde for years to come.\n",
        "The closest thing the movie has to a point of view is a tendentious and mystifying voice-over, in which Fry reads excerpts from Wilde's fairy tale about a selfish giant who banishes his children from his garden.\n",
        "Mr. Fry's warmly sympathetic performance finds the gentleness beneath the wit. He conveys the sense of a man at the mercy of forces he cannot control, not least of them his own brittle genius.\n",
        "Stephen Fry brings a depth and gentleness to the role that says what can be said about Oscar Wilde: that he was a funny and gifted idealist in a society that valued hypocrisy above honesty.\n",
        "Bosie is one of history's legendary bad boyfriends, and Jude Law plays him to the hilt. He's spoiled and angry, flies into bug-eyed rages and seems bent on destroying Wilde and his work.\n",

        "One of the most insightful and wrenching portraits of the joys and tribulations of being a classical musician ever filmed.\n",
        "GUTSY, moving, provocative, intelligent and thoroughly grown-up, Hilary and Jackie is one of the best movies of the year.\n",
        "This is as rich and powerful a film as has been released in 1998!\n",
        "A superb biographical account of the tragic life of cellist Jacqueline Du Pre and of the complex relationship between her and her older sister!\n",
        "A flawed but powerful Shine-esque tale of love, music, and madness!\n",
        "An extraordinary film!\n",
        "Profound and haunting!\n",
        "The acting by Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths, playing Jackie and Hilary, respectively, as adults, is first-rate.\n",
        "A staccato narrative parallels the experiences and hallucinations of a woman on drugs with those of her son and his friends.\n",
        "Burnished camerawork and ex-Pop Will Eat Itself head Mansell's part-punchy, part-elegiac score reinforce and counterpoint the increasingly nightmarish visuals.\n",

        "Both bleak and bleakly funny, appalling in its excesses and exhilarating in its execution.\n",
        "Remarkable -- easily the most searing movie-going experience of the year.\n",
        "Aronofsky has fashioned a chilling vision that lives up to the caustic irony of its title and gives us a nightmare that is not lightly forgotten.\n",
        "Unfortunately, once Requiem for a Dream accumulates all this elaborate and suggestive paraphernalia, it plummets in an inexorable, almost mechanical spiral.\n",
        "Merely uses innovative means to tell a trite story.\n",
        "[Aronofsky] shoots himself in the foot repeatedly.\n",
        "It's a downer -- and far more because of Aronofsky's vanity than because of Selby's brutally candid story.\n",
        "Film lovers with a high threshold for unpleasantness will get a contact high from Aronofsky's muscular manipulations of imagery and editing.\n",
        "Aronofsky brings a new urgency to the drug movie by trying to reproduce, through his subjective camera, how his characters feel, or want to feel, or fear to feel.\n",
        "Once again, a young director with a wildly overpraised debut film has decided to forgo good taste in favor of advertising his own far-reaching \"bravery.\"\n",
        "Requiem for a Dream may be the first movie to fully capture the way that drugs dislocate us from ourselves.\n",
        "Something like a poetry of degradation and sorrow.\n",
        "It's a dose of speed, and you can't say no.\n",
        "This is like no other film you've ever seen.\n",
        "It's two hours of slumming in a vision of hell hatched from bourgeois comfort.\n",
        "Slickly enjoyable!\n",
        "Although the film takes a worthwhile detour or two, it ultimately finds its way back to the well-worn track of its genre.\n",

        "Varsity Blues eventually fizzles out badly!\n",
        "Scenes work, but they don't pile up and build momentum.\n",
        "The football scenes are involving, the acting is up to snuff, and there is something about those last days of high school that remains a solid background for even the most familiar of stories.\n",
        "Excellent casting!\n",
        "It delivers the goods in a fresh manner.\n",
        "An unappetizing mix of raucously vulgar comedy and teen-angst melodrama.\n",
        "A paint-by-numbers story that offers no surprises and a hero and villain etched in white and black with few shades of gray.\n",

        "Your average winter cold follows a less predictable course.\n",
        "Until the diverting special effects take center stage, this story, about an alien intelligence that builds an army out of flesh and metal, pathetically exploits genre conventions without generating self-reference, camp, or thrills.\n",
        "A derivative sci-fi shocker that isn't likely to spark much interest beyond its target audience of undemanding genre fans.\n",
        "While he can fling together a competent action or special effects sequence, his handling of the plot and actors is strictly routine.\n",
        "Frankly, about 20 minutes into this dud, I was rooting for the alien beasties.\n",
        "An unpretentious, amusing thrill-a-minute sci-fi horror thriller / monster movie that plugs right into fears of a Y2K crisis.\n",
        "Completely predictable and largely fright-free!\n",
        "The monsters themselves are quite a bit less than frightening, most of them being little mechanical gadgets with spidery legs and not much resistance to machine-gun fire.\n",
        "The dialogue tends toward the obvious, and the characters are constantly explaining what is happening to one another.\n",
        "95 minutes of unrelieved tedium.\n",

        "Daffy Duck will be pleased to hear he didn't miss any career opportunities when he wasn't chosen to star in Howard the Duck, although producers certainly could have benefited from his talents.\n",
        "[An] aimless movie.\n",
        "Choose the part that suits your taste, but this is a case where half a movie -- either half -- is apt to be better than the whole.\n",
        "Plenty of talent is wasted here.\n",
        "It overstays its welcome by 20 minutes or so, just long enough for us to begin to feel a little silly for having so much fun.\n",
        "On a scene-by-scene basis, it sometimes entertains, but never amounts to anything.\n",
        "The worst occult film to star big-name actors in many years, and a startlingly inept and unsatisfying piece of storytelling.\n",
        "Watching The Ninth Gate is like being force-marched through dank rooms piled high with musty books, led by drab tour guides who mutter the same pedantic points over and over.\n",
        "I kept hoping Polanski would take the plot by the neck and shake life into it, but no.\n",
        "About as scary as a sock-puppet re-enactment of The Blair Witch Project, and not nearly as funny.\n",
        "Early on I thought I could almost smell the sharp must of the leather bindings ... but that scent was just the aroma of middle-brow, art-house Euro-rot, a whiff of decay and hauteur.\n",
        "The film never gets around to illuminating much about the lead character.\n",
        "The self-immolating and oblivion-bound Ninth Gate is the kind of film that's going to give satanic cults a bad name.\n",
        "Elegant, scary fun.\n",
        "Compulsively watchable.\n",
        "You end up feeling duped for taking a two-hour-plus ride that dumps you in the middle of nowhere.\n",
        "What makes The Fly such a stunning piece of obsessive film making is the way Cronenberg deftly allows us to identify with his monstrous creation.\n",
        "Wildly imaginative, gut-wrenchingly scarifying and profoundly primal (not to mention funny), David Cronenberg's The Fly is a movie that whacks you in the solar plexus and leaves you gasping.\n",
        "What's good about the film are the strong performances and the ingenious, mostly amusing script. What's ugly, of course, is the grossness. And what's bad is the movie's inability to reconcile its good and ugly aspects.\n",
        "As slimy and as grotesque as some of its special effects become, The Fly is a far superior horror film to the top-grossing film in America of late, Aliens.\n",
        "The Fly seizes on our ingrained, instinctive horror of sexuality, the sense of shame that our fundamentally puritanical society can't help but teach us, and by confirming our worst fears, helps us, for a moment, to move beyond them.\n",
        "A gross-your-eyes-out horror movie that is also the year's most poignant romance.\n",
        "David Cronenberg's remake of the 1958 horror classic The Fly is not for the squeamish. Casting Jeff Goldblum was a good choice as he brings a quirky, common touch to the spacey scientist role.\n",
        "The Fly is almost unique for a horror movie in that it compels us sympathize with and root for the characters.\n",
        "Image so much subverts intention that Jeff Goldblum's tragic flyperson finally seems more ludicrous than affecting, voyeuristically bizarre.\n",
        "The playful, quirky chemistry between Goldblum and Davis in the first half of the movie ensures that this gothic horror is heartbreaking as well as stomach-churning.\n",
        "...a film that tries to be too many things at once -- funny but not campy, sad and scary, a horror story and a human tragedy...\n",
        "An initially promising, but quickly disappointing retread of Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel's hugely influential horror classic.\n",
        "'Inspired by a true story' presumably adds to the sordid thrills; maybe we should look forward to entertainments about Nazis torturing children.\n",
        "Here's a slice of advice: Go to the video store and rent the original.\n",
        "The best one can say is that his version is not slavishly in thrall to Hooper's: boring, fright-free and pointless, maybe, but not craven.\n",
        "All the bad-rehash mojo from Friday the 13th to The Blair Witch Project has infected Scott Kosar's script.\n",
        "... a bloody good time of a B-movie.\n",
        "Sheer simplicity of the idea gets overwhelmed by, of all things, production values.\n",
        "An overproduced, video-director remake, slick and grue-marinated and loud as a sonic boom.\n",
        "Weakens, dilutes, disinfects and otherwise undermines the legacy of Tobe Hooper's 1974 original.\n",
        "You realize how hard this is on me, to have to tell you what a superb job director Marcus Nispel has done re-creating, yet also revising, 1974's grisly, gristly, protein-centric masterpiece.\n",
        "Next to this redundant, pointless and witless retread, the classic status of Tobe Hooper's original version is officially beyond dispute.\n",
        "Mainly it's a vapid, vicious thrill ride that washes away immediately.\n",
        "Unlike movies such as Seven, there isn't enough style in the new The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to justify the bloodbath, and it's riddled with too much been-there-done-that to endure as a classic.\n",
        "The new Massacre lowers the bar much the way the original 'dead teenager' horror flick did way back in 1974, and makes a mockery of that industry self-policing rubber stamp known as the ratings board.\n",
        "Does convey the sense of being caught in a nightmare. A stupid person's nightmare.\n",
        "A splatterfest remake that relentlessly assaults the senses and mind with no discernable redeeming social value.\n",
        "Just as humorless as the original, but it's also slicker, glossier and resoundingly artificial.\n",
        "Gruesome enough; what it lacks is a distinctive revolting personality of its own.\n",
        "No matter how adeptly Chainsaw 2 was put together, it would remain just another exploitation flick for fans who get a tingle from watching blades slash into flesh and innards peep out.\n",
        "Part 2 has a lot of blood and disembowelment, to be sure, but it doesn't have the terror of the original, the desire to be taken seriously. It's a geek show.\n",
        "For those who saw the first two Massacres, this will seem pretty much deja-boo!\n",
        "The film is plagued by too many long, dead moments in which the story doesn't seem to be getting anywhere and attention wanders.\n",
        "Another ethnic group -- Cajuns, this time -- suffers the patronizing ministrations of the American Independent Cinema.\n",
        "It's billed as a romantic comedy, but Cajun humor, like crawfish gumbo, takes some getting used to.\n",
        "This is an impressive debut film.\n",
        "Belizaire has personality and quiet charm and a lot of affection, mixed in with the more predictable action elements.\n",
        "This prom-night balloon of a movie floats easily above the year's other exercises in '50s nostalgia. If you dare reach for it, it will land smartly in your heart.\n",
        "It's grave, lumbering, arrhythmic, and bloated, an emotional hogwallow of catchpenny insights and easy sentimentality.\n",
        "What makes this treatment unique is that the jokes aren't so much derivative of pop culture, but are instead found in the learned wisdom of a middle-aged woman reacting to her own teenage dilemmas.\n",
        "Ignore the ridiculous happy ending of this film, and you have a much more fatalistic exercise in which Coppola eschews easy laughs in favour of the exposure of feeling and the fact that these people's lives, however empty, matter to them.\n",
        "Miss Turner's self-assured comic timing goes a long way toward salvaging the film, providing both moral and physical dimension to a role that scarcely exists.\n",
        "This time Coppola apparently simply wanted to make a movie, and put some characters on the screen, and tell a story. He has, all right. This is one of the best movies of the year.\n",
        "It's a wistful fantasy, a bright reminiscence, a Stroll down memory lane that's as glowingly conceived as it is slightly flawed.\n",
        "Here you don't see Coppola the camera wizard, you see Coppola the storyteller, the maker of fables. And by the end, you don't feel warmly just toward the movie, but toward the man behind it.\n",
        "Too slow to constitute an adventure and has too few laughs to be a comedy.\n",
        "The violence is still pleasantly paddling-pool stuff, but the disarming G'day factor has been pasteurised away.\n",
        "The earlier one had novelty to keep it going, and this time the novelty has begun to wear thin, even if Mr. Hogan remains generally irresistible.\n",
        "\"'Crocodile' Dundee II\" is about as laid-back a movie as you're ever likely to nap through. The actors take forever to recite their lines, and scenes unfold as if the filmmakers had rented the screen by the month.\n",
        "Doesn't follow so much as drag itself along like an alligator on dry land.\n",
        "Neither thrilling nor horrific, the camera, plotting, dialogue and atmosphere are uniformly unconvincing: a conservatoire of false notes.\n",
        "Not the high point of the Mailer career, but it's a small, entertaining part of it.\n",
        "Hard to classify; at times you laugh raucously at what's up on the screen; at others you stare dumbly, in stunned amazement.\n",
        "What is strange is that Tough Guys Don't Dance leaves me with such vivid memories of its times and places, its feelings and weathers, and yet leaves me so completely indifferent to its plot. Watching the film, I laughed a good deal.\n",
        "Norman Mailer's best film, adapted from his worst novel, shows a surprising amount of cinematic savvy and style.\n",
        "This social farce is excellently written, fast paced and intelligently directed.\n",
        "In the end, however, it's let down by one easy laugh too many.\n",
        "It's a blithe, silly, good-natured movie and, of its kind, quite an enjoyable one.\n",
        "The pity is, it isn't even outrageous.\n",
        "Of course, simply everyone is completely bamboozled by our hero's disguise, even though he now looks like a Ken doll with liver disease.\n",
        "This is a genuinely interesting idea, filled with dramatic possibilities, but the movie approaches it on the level of a dim-witted sit-com.\n",
        "We are not on Rocky's side of the street, but in Martin Scorsese country, where bent character, not sentiment, shapes destiny, and the best the struggling human spirit can hope for is a split decision.\n",
        "Pic has a distinctive pulse of its own with exceptional performances by Paul Newman and Tom Cruise.\n",
        "A solidly crafted entertainment that, for the most part, strikes a successful balance between commercial necessity and personal expression.\n",
        "Scorsese's direction at its most downmarket and upbeat -- never have pool tables, balls and cues looked so rich and strange.\n",
        "A stunning vehicle -- a white Cadillac among the other mainstream American movies of the season.\n",
        "It doesn't have the electricity, the wound-up tension, of [Scorsese's] best work, and as a result I was too aware of the story marching by.\n",
        "In the end, Money is a scratch, a contrived cliffhanger that sets us up for Hustler III.\n",
        "Scorsese gets you inside the game in a way most sports movies never hint at.\n",
        "The Color of Money is a good movie, but perhaps not a good sequel.\n",
        "When Mr. Norris, the former karate champion, isn't using his feet on ill-tempered Indians and Mexicans, he's stomping on the facetious dialogue, which deserves it more.\n",
        "There are really only two good words to say about this wreck -- Melody Anderson.\n",
        "Kitsch.\n",
        "Where to start with this movie? Where to end? Even more to the point, in which order to show the reels?\n",
        "It's the laziness of the project that's finally most galling.\n",
        "[Three Amigos is] a goofy delight. It's like a cross between a big-budget Three Stooges movie and a Hope-Crosby road picture, with dozens of old cowpoke gags thrown in to spice up the brew.\n",
        "While it's occasionally funny, Three Amigos! isn't an entirely fun occasion.\n",
        "You know it's a boring comedy when you find yourself laughing only at the lead actors' costumes.\n",
        "The happy-go-lucky Three Amigos is a picture to see when your expectations are down and you've already been to everything that's good.\n",
        "On the whole there's not a lot of flesh on these cynically haphazard bones.\n",
        "A few choice morsels of brilliant humor can't save Three Amigos! from missing the whole enchilada.\n",
        "If you enjoy brainless slapstick that allows space for irrelvant absurdities like a singing bush and an invisible swordsman, it's entertaining enough.\n",
        "Three Amigos is likable, but it never really finds a distinctive style. Not quite parody and not quite serious, it's more like a lengthy costume party.\n",
        "The script of Three Amigos plays like it was slapped together by a few friends with a tape recorder enjoying a charming weekend at the beach.\n",
        "All great farces need a certain insane focus, an intensity that declares how important they are to themselves. This movie is too confident, too relaxed, too clever to be really funny.\n",
        "It's a calamity of a comedy, the perfect complement to concession-stand nachos con cheez.\n",
        "She's All That feels like it could have been made by a team of septuagenarians from the glory days of American Intl. Pictures.\n",
        "It's often impossible to distinguish what's meant to be cartoonish from what's meant to be dramatic, but the confusion seems appropriately adolescent.\n",
        "A formula flick.\n",
        "A trite classic.\n",
        "Only Prinze, who has the ethereal, gentlemanly quality of a young Anthony Perkins, gets enough screen time to really make an impression.\n",
        "It's a pleasing but routine effort.\n",
        "Director Robert Iscove isn't really taxing his imagination, but that's probably just as well.\n",
        "She's All That is not a great movie, but it has its moments.\n",
        "She's All That is essentially a formulaic comedy, but it has enough glimmerings of originality and wit to make you wish it were much bolder and funnier than it turns out to be.\n",
        "To say this isn't original is to understate the matter. However, although it's questionable whether this story has ever been done well, that hasn't stopped filmmakers from repeatedly trying.\n",
        "In the process of discovering each other, both Laney and Zack learn that it's as OK to change as it is to stay the same, perhaps even better.\n",
        "Demonstrates why Mel Gibson is a movie star: He can take mediocre material and through sheer willpower -- not to mention oodles of charm -- make it work.\n",
        "A higher class of thriller.\n",
        "It quickly slides into a Lethal Weapon without Danny Glover, complete with blowups and wisecracks, gratuitous torture scenes and Gibson in familiar form as the twinkling rascal who makes a virtue out of viciousness.\n",
        "In the popcorn sense, it certainly delivers on mindless escapism. In the artistic sense, let's just say that Payback is a long way from Point Blank.\n",
        "It's undone not so much by the shadow of Lee Marvin falling heavily on it (which it does) as by the twin obstacles of big star image and, more to the point, excessive violence.\n",
        "Sadly, though, Payback finally puts Gibson at the mercy of a torture and sadism sequence so attenuated and so painful to watch that it sabotages the picture's own quite solid instincts for theater, innovation and wit.\n",
        "Sadism is the film's only real subject, and its only real life as well.\n",
        "There is much cleverness and ingenuity in Payback.\n",
        "This film is riddled with cliches and impossible situations.\n",
        "A mind-mangling disappointment, with a dopey sell-out ending.\n",
        "Direction is choppy, the interplay between the characters is perfunctory, although not as perfunctory as the unearned ending.\n",
        "The film has a flat quality that cannot entirely be overcome by the sensational animation and the obvious good intentions of its creators.\n",
        "Roland Topor's graphics create a world reminiscent of two of the greatest artists of the fantastic, Bosch and Odilon Redon.\n",
        "For original, thoughtful, often strong (but tasteful) animation, I recommend Fantastic Planet for family viewing.\n",
        "It's not every fancifully encoded cautionary tale that can survive the demise of its historical villains, and it's not every stoner midnight movie that can stand a second viewing in the sober light of day.\n",
        "Blast From the Past saves its best for first.\n",
        "Fraser is the sweet, goofy engine that drives this movie. The script doesn't do enough with his reactions to a world that bears little relation to the Cold War planet Adam has been told about, but Fraser still manages to suggest volumes.\n",
        "Garish and not funny enough, Wilson's shapeless satire plods on, squandering its nice premise and its appealing actors. Miraculously, Fraser has a force field around him and manages to radiate energy in this comic black hole.\n",
        "Thanks to a clever script, tight direction, a first-rate cast and the dynamite combination of Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone, Blast from the Past blows away the recent crop of romantic comedies.\n",
        "That's a relatively clever set-up for what's become a familiar genre: the time-displacement comedy, in which we get a kick out of viewing our era through another era's eyes. But this movie's eyes, Adam's, are awfully twinkly and not too focused.\n",
        "Unfortunately Mr. Fraser comes off as a forlorn, outsize Pee Wee Herman.\n",
        "The 40-minute setup is deliciously nutty, with eccentric turns from Walken and Spacek. But the longer Adam remains above ground, the more plodding and predictable the scenario becomes.\n",
        "Despite its original concept, the movie loses much of its socially satiric edge once Fraser emerges from his underground bunker and starts wooing Silverstone.\n",
        "Blast From the Past doesn't overtax Fraser's abilities -- the film is only a sweet comic confection -- but director and co-writer Hugh Wilson does rely on a rare quality that Fraser has in spades: charm.\n",
        "A stretched-out anecdote.\n",
        "Blast From the Past has a sweet, joyful spirit and some fun performances.\n",
        "What's good in Blast From the Past is so inventive and what's bad is so blinkered that the best way to describe this fascinating, failed romantic comedy may be as a movie blown to hell.\n",
        "Director/co-scenarist Hugh Wilson does acceptable work here, yet the concept's myriad possibilities for satirical and fairy-tale riffing go untapped.\n",
        "The broad obvious jokes are generally tossed away with a panache that might be mistaken for subtlety; the performances are affable; and there's even the odd surprise along the way.\n",
        "Blast From the Past is a cute little movie until it comes out of its bomb shelter, and then it turns distressingly stale right before our eyes.\n",
        "In Fraser's hands, Adam's bottomless, puppy-like demeanor is a pleasure to experience.\n",
        "Blast from the Past is a sweet-natured comedy that is worth seeing.\n",
        "While this comedy strives for teen-age appeal above ground, it's mostly the fallout shelter notion that makes for the laughs.\n",
        "The movie is funny and entertaining in all the usual ways, yes, but I was grateful that it tried for more: that it was actually about something, that it had an original premise, that it used satire and irony and had sly undercurrents.\n",
        "Julia Sweeney delivers an extended monologue that's so exquisitely written and so emotionally touching that she manages the near-impossible task of captivating the audience for 85 minutes with quite a demanding material.\n",
        "Shameless in its use of mental retardation as a gimmick, a prop and a plot device.\n",
        "There's a word for this vulgar family-therapy movie: retarded.\n",
        "Everything is reduced to a transparent formula. And everyone plays their schematic part.\n",
        "A neatly wrapped made-for-TV homily!\n",
        "So over-the-top maudlin that it makes Patch Adams and Stepmom look stoic and reserved.\n",
        "Never manages more than a glib, TV movie-of- the-week glance at their lives.\n",
        "Beautifully acted!\n",

        "Another middle-aged male-crisis opus, it begins on a note of total migraine-inducing hysteria, which continues unabated throughout.\n",
        "Unwatchable!\n",
        "The movie looks and feels like a frantic, live-action psychedelic cartoon.\n",
        "A long series of misfires in writing and acting.\n",
        "Rudolph's film, like most of his others, just isn't funny enough to sustain the lunacy.\n",
        "If you can stand the tumult, you may find yourself feeling giddy as you watch old pros like Nolte, Willis, Hershey and, especially, Finney play at such a high pitch.\n",
        "A misfire.\n",
        "Breakfast of Champions is a weirdly stillborn experience.\n",
        "Tasteless adaptation makes for flaky Breakfast.\n",
        "Sharp dialogue and detailed observations make it a good deal funnier than you might expect.\n",
        "It's not a good sign when a movie is called The Break-Up and you can't wait for the couple to split so they'll get some relief from one another, and give the audience some relief from them.\n",
        "One seemingly terminal problem with the casting of Ms. Aniston and Mr. Vaughn is that neither of their careers has featured characters who excelled at one-to-one relationships with the opposite sex.\n",
        "Vince Vaughn kills me. Jennifer Aniston, I think, is underrated as a film actress.\n",
        "The movie offers nothing funny, just a series of sour situations.\n",
        "The Break-Up, a grim excuse for a romantic comedy, is basically an hour and 45 minutes spent in the company of two unpleasant people during a miserable time in their lives.\n",
        "It's the most interesting spin on domestic strife since Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner were hurling dishes at each other in The War of the Roses.\n",
        "In short, The Break-Up is too accurate to be light-hearted, too light and flippant to be really romantic.\n",
        "A romantic comedy that's short on both romance and comedy.\n",
        "With a movie unwilling to go for the jugular, it's more like the dismal The Story of Us than The War of the Roses.\n",
        "I don't know if The Break-Up qualifies as a date movie. But it will serve as a cautionary tale for couples falling in love.\n",
        "Listening to people bicker for almost two hours wears thin, especially when the comedy is never quite so funny as you had hoped it would be.\n",
        "It might not be the frosted lemon tart that's been advertised for months, but it is solid, satisfying fare -- flecked with humor, grounded in pain.\n",
        "The Break-Up goes badly wrong. Although possessed of a laudable desire not to be yet another run-of-the-mill, wacky-impediment -- damned if the picture can figure out how to be an anti-romance comedy.\n",
        "As an off-beat anatomy of a troubled couple, the film almost succeeds. As summer movie fun well, it's not.\n",
        "If you really feel the need to be bullied and insulted, just call up your HMO provider or reserve a table at an expensive restaurant.\n",
        "It doesn't work as a revealing look at relationships or as a consistently funny comedy about the war between the sexes.\n",
        "If 7 Up is the un-cola, consider The Break-Up, -- the un-romantic comedy.\n",
        "Like so many contemporary movies, The Break-Up doesn't know when to call it quits, and the film finally expires after several false endings.\n",
        "It tries to be all genre and no story, and it almost works.\n",
        "[Altman] attempts the impossible and pulls it off.\n",
        "Imamura's rough sexual humor is still in evidence, but now it has taken on a dark tone: to make love is to flirt with death.\n",
        "This deja vu premise [from the novel by Stephen King] combined with the crazed vehicle format, makes Christine appear pretty shop-worn.\n",
        "Carpenter's thematic self-consciousness can't entirely overcome a shaky dramatic structure that sacrifices character logic to increasingly meaningless thrills.\n",
        "Off the page, a 1958 Plymouth is no more scary than the St Bernard which romped through Cujo.\n",
        "This is the kind of movie where you walk out with a silly grin, get in your car, and lay rubber halfway down the Eisenhower.\n",
        "Only a moderately engrossing film.\n",
        "Likeable.\n",
        "This is a halfway funny movie, one that's got loads of good gags in its first half and nothing but trouble in its second.\n",
        "This isn't as snappily directed or as caustically conceived as the subsequent Risky Business, which has a similar theme, but it's arguably just as sexy and almost as funny.\n",
        "Consistently inert -- even though the fee for successful housesitting has been raised to a million bucks a night.\n",
        "House on Haunted Hill is the kind of horror movie that's not a bit scary and quite a bit gross.\n",
        "As in The Haunting, they eventually surrender characters and story to computer-generated spectacle, squandering any creepy immediacy and trampling the human element.\n",
        "A bloody mess.\n",
        "House on Haunted Hill is a sorry reincarnation of the 1950s William Castle horror film.\n",
        "Instead of thrill and chills, it's kills and spills.\n",
        "Fails to deliver even one good 'boo!' moment.\n",
        "Paints its characters in strokes so broad just one would cover a barn, and, in the end, indulges in lame, dull digital effects that would put a 5-year-old to sleep.\n",
        "Directed with a nimble, savvy touch.\n",
        "Slow-moving, yawn-inducing.\n",
        "The movie doesn't stick together in one's head; this thing is like some junky fairground show -- a chamber of horrors with skeletons that jump up.\n",
        "Irwin Allen, the Busby Berkeley of natural disasters and other people's troubles, teams up with John Guillermin, a competent if undistinguished action director.\n",
        "The Towering Inferno is one of the greatest disaster pictures made, a personal and professional triumph for producer Irwin Allen.\n",
        "A starry cast share out roles that are less like characters than places in a lifeboat.\n",
        "You may not come out of the theater with any important ideas about American architecture or enterprise, but you will have had a vivid, completely safe nightmare.\n",
        "The Towering Inferno is a brawny blockbuster of a movie, by far the best of the mid-1970s wave of disaster films.\n",
        "A numbing combination of sloppy writing, vulgar art direction, high school acting, and bungled special effects.\n",
        "Fundamentally, this is just further proof of Hollywood's untiring ability to reduce all science fiction to its most feeble stereotypes.\n",
        "Harmless fun enlivened by a couple of sequences that are as good as the entire film should have been.\n",
        "Logan's Run is a vast, silly extravaganza that delivers a certain amount of fun, once it stops taking itself seriously.\n",
        "As illuminatingly bleak a statement on human hubris as a Hollywood superproduction has given us.\n",
        "Planet of the Apes is an amazing film.\n",
        "Planet of the Apes is one of those rare films whose historical impact outweighs its quality. It's a good film, but not a classic.\n",
        "Dismal SF deep think (1968) that gave birth to an equally dismal string of sequels and TV series spin-offs.\n",
        "It is quickly paced, completely entertaining, and its philosophical pretensions don't get in the way.\n",
        "A dreadful film, a compendium of clumsy dialogue, one-dimensional characters, risible plot turns and long silences broken by incomprehensible meaningful looks.\n",
        "Hokey and slapdash.\n",
        "This first sequel to Planet of the Apes isn't bad, but already shows the way the original conception was to degenerate into routine comic strip adventure.\n",
        "Considering the usual fate of sequels, it's not so much that this final effort [from a story by Paul Dehn] is limp, but that the previous four pix maintained for so long a good quality level.\n",
        "[It] seems reluctant to use the potentials for astute comic strip philosophy that all the other films revelled in to a greater or lesser extent.\n",
        "Battle looks like the last gap of a dying series, a movie made simply to wring the dollars out of any remaining ape fans.\n",
        "The Planet of the Apes series takes an angry turn in the fourth entry.\n",
        "Dismally lurid stuff, ham-fistedly directed and low on credibility.\n",
        "J. Lee Thompson's direction furiously propels the action in a compact chromium-and-glass setting -- and wait till you see that last battle royal.\n",
        "Escape from the Planet of the Apes is an excellent film, almost as good as the original Planet of the Apes.\n",
        "It's a long way down from even the second in the series.\n",
        "One of the better new movies in town, and better in a genre -- science-fiction -- that at the crucial middle level where the history of movies is made, if not written, has recently been not so much bad as invisible.\n",
        "Bracingly chilly!\n",
        "It's rote baloney, trotting out every dead-stupid cop-movie cliche in the book and doing it colorlessly.\n",
        "An enjoyable ride!\n",
        "A half-hearted photograph of the real thing.\n",
        "Take away all the flash and dazzle, and what you're left with in The Corruptor is a police procedural.\n",
        "Hard Boiled, directed by the master of the genre, director John Woo, is a cult favorite. The Corruptor isn't in that league.\n",
        "Visceral. Textural. Interesting.\n",
        "Jarringly entertaining!\n",
        "James Foley directs with lean, mean stylishness and the charismatic Yun-Fat finally gets a Hollywood vehicle worthy of his talents.\n",
        "It surprises by taking us inside Chinatown, where we discover just how sinister and elaborate the relationships between the police and the businessmen can be.\n",
        "What's both depressing and impressive about Cruel Intentions is the profound misanthropy of its meaning.\n",
        "You won't be able to resist the film's ribaldry and cynicism. Kids these days!\n",
        "Lascivious blackmailers and inveterate immoralists, these characters behave despicably, but the movie affects a tone of urbane detachment which puts sex in its proper perspective.\n",
        "You sometimes have to giggle at this movie the way you do when you catch 4-year-olds playing dress-up in front of Mom's closet.\n",
        "It is maliciously entertaining, up to a point.\n",
        "This is the filmic answer to a pack of Spice Girl cards.\n",
        "Rarely has a film elicited more raucous unintended laughter.\n",
        "Smart and merciless!\n",
        "Neither the characters nor the events are exactly the same as those of the novel, but some of the same spirit comes across.\n",
        "You may come to realize that if a bomb suddenly blew up everyone on screen, you wouldn't particularly miss anyone.\n",
        "You have the queasy sense that the whole thing is just an elaborate stunt, and in this case an exploitative one.\n",
        "Though writer-director Roger Kumble doesn't fully exploit this conceit, Cruel Intentions is still briskly enjoyable, what people might call a 'guilty pleasure' -- only it's the sort of film that would mock anyone who felt guilt in pleasure.\n",
        "The teen-age target audience will probably gobble Cruel Intentions right up, but for me this film boarders on creepy.\n",
        "Bad acting, implausible plot twists and sure-to-be-classic bad lines!\n",
        "The likes of Glenn Close and John Malkovich have given way to unconvincing actors who can't grasp the concept that roles of this complexity require more than good looks.\n",
        "The film is pitched too high and too rich to make a solid connection with most young viewers.\n",
        "Foxy, snotty, enjoyably trashy!\n",
        "Nasty, profane and wickedly entertaining!\n",
        "Cruel Intentions is the dirtiest-minded American movie in recent memory -- and an honestly corrupt entertaining picture is never anything to sneeze at.\n",
        "Overbaked, overproduced, and overliterary!\n",
        "Well-acted but pedestrian TV-like melodrama what what consitutes a family, or sociology versus biology in the kinship debate.\n",
        "Excruciatingly earnest yet convictionless.\n",
        "Though the ingredients are potent, their blending here mostly comes off as formulaic, humdrum and sometimes unintentionally laughable.\n",
        "Wing Commander is based on a video game and has roughly the same degree of character development. That is all most moviegoers will need to know.\n",
        "The plot has all the depth and originality of a video game without the fun of the interactivity.\n",
        "Though this could be the meat of a good space story, the combat scenes are weak variations of the game's.\n",
        "These actors, alas, are at the service of a submoronic script and special effects that look like a video game writ large.\n",
        "As the movie transforms into a video game -- with a faux John Williams score to boot -- the human element turns corny, then laughable.\n",
        "Things get truly dispiriting when the character dramas recede and the spark provided by Lillard and Holder goes out, leaving us only one incomprehensible battle after another.\n",
        "An overpriced mess!\n",
        "The actors are basically helpless with this.\n",
        "A lavish illustration of how to take a fairly modest black-and -white horror film from 1963 and amplify it so relentlessly that the sight of the flying cow in Twister would not be all that amiss.\n",
        "If you crave horror, you're better off seeing The Blair Witch Project a second or third.\n",
        "The Haunting is a muddled mess that defies any rationality.\n",
        "In The Haunting, the moviemakers succeed in something very difficult: creating a haunted house with real personality and terror.\n",
        "Clumsy, bloated and wretchedly overdone!\n",
        "Worse than awful!\n",
        "This film relies on special effects instead of suggestion, plot instead of mood, and explanation instead of mystery.\n",
        "There are few truly frightening moments in the film, little tension or real sense of menace, and the camp humor that is suggested in early scenes dissipates fairly quickly.\n",
        "To my surprise, I find myself recommending The Haunting on the basis of its locations, its sets, its art direction, its sound design, and the overall splendor of its visuals.\n",
        "A passable piece of summer hokum, but it underlines how difficult it has become to make an effective horror movie.\n",
        "Shockingly lethargic!\n",
        "Director David Cronenberg handles his usual fondness for gore in muted style.\n",
        "People like myself who find the character played by [Genevieve] Bujold (in one of her best performances) more interesting than either of the twins are bound to feel rather frustrated by the end.\n",
        "An intense psychological drama which confronts [Cronenberg's] familiar preoccupations -- fear of physical and mental disintegration, mortality, the power struggle between the sexes -- without the paradoxical protection of visceral disgust.\n",
        "Cronenberg, who has begun to emerge as a master of body-related horrific fantasy, clearly understands that a small amount of medical mischief can be more unnerving than conventional grisliness.\n",
        "Really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious.\n",
        "The kind of movie where you ask people how they liked it, and they say, 'Well, it was well made,' and then they wince.\n",
        "Watching Ringers is not unlike watching a critical operation -- unnerving but also enthralling.\n",
        "A thoroughly misguided, unfunny film.\n",
        "There are ticklish moments, but no real laughs.\n",
        "The hokey dialogue and witless physical gags keep everything painful and hectoring.\n",
        "If the remainder of this century will bring a lamer film than Baby Geniuses, may I please be in Estonia when it comes.\n",
        "The movie is about as endearing as unanesthetized gum surgery.\n",
        "The film has a freak-show quality.\n",
        "One way to get through Baby Geniuses is to think about whether it really is the worst movie you've ever seen. Probably not, but pretty darn close.\n",
        "Story? Who cares. Character development? That's for show-offs. Funny dialogue? Too hard to write. These babies can talk!!\n",
        "I'll admit to chuckling a few times during the proceedings, but it's not worth losing 1 1/2 hours of one's life for a few minutes of amusement.\n",
        "Bad films are easy to make, but a film as unpleasant as Baby Geniuses achieves a kind of grandeur.\n",
        "Typically overproduced.\n",
        "All the ingredients that made Rodgers & Hammerstein's The King and I a memorable stage experience have been faithfully transferred to the screen.\n",
        "Over-long but visually spectacular.\n",

        "Thornton and Willis save the day with their performances.\n",
        "I like movies that don't settle into a groove, especially if the groove is already well worn. But the different kinds of movies that make up Bandits are pretty worn, too.\n",
        "It's just about impossible not to fall for the ingratiating trio, especially Thornton's Terry.\n",
        "What started as cute becomes cloying and bloated.\n",
        "The movie has a one-take feel about it, containing vast stretches where nothing much happens. The cinematography looks amateurish, often badly composed and poorly lit.\n",
        "Levinson must think he's on safe ground morally by keeping Bandits bloodless, as if the absence of carnage somehow makes kidnapping and armed robbery wholesome.\n",
        "Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton may be the bank robbers in Barry Levinson's likable comedy Bandits, but Cate Blanchett is the real thief.\n",
        "Bandits isn't any better than a good formula picture -- it isn't incisive or memorable, just light and amusing -- but it's different.\n",
        "Bandits is a more nuanced film than the goofy previews make it out to be. It's funnier, for one thing, and more lyrical.\n",
        "A screwball comedy in the best tradition, it's easily the best-written mainstream film to come out this year.\n",
        "Bandits is guilty of behaving like a petty thievery corporation; it steals from so many other sources that we're forced to realize that it has little of its own to offer.\n",
        "Plenty of great one-liners.\n",
        "An occasionally hilarious movie that works (to the extent it does work) despite the director's best efforts to muck it up.\n",
        "Connects often enough for serviceable value-for-dollar entertainment.\n",
        "Too bad we're ready for the film's final pay-off 20 minutes before it comes. Less is more in comedy and a bit less would have made Bandits more successful. As it is, both the performers and the audience end up robbed by excess.\n",
        "Like all the best outlaws, it empties your pockets painlessly, and leaves a good story behind.\n",
        "When actors, a director and a screenwriter all love the characters they've created, their glee can be infectious.\n",
        "Little more than a typical TV segment writ large for the mutiplexes.\n",
        "These spin-offs remain animation on the cheap, and none yet -- straitjacketed by fidelity to its respective series -- has attained the density of image and kineticism of design of the art form's true originals.\n",
        "The film hasn't much entertainment value for those much over the age of 10. There's not a thing in the world wrong with that.\n",
        "A sweetly spoofy, thoughtful animated feature, sure to please its preteen target audience.\n",
        "Not inspired children's entertainment, but it has a certain charm.\n",

        "Rugrats it ain't.\n",
        "The real problem here is the characters' utter blandness of conception.\n",
        "Extremely violent, extremely preposterous, extremely entertaining, The Matrix succeeds at two extremely difficult tasks: as a vast, exciting virtual-reality movie and as a defibrillator for Keanu Reeves' big screen career.\n",

        "The Wachowskis and cinematographer Bill Pope take advantage of currently available technical trickery to create visually distinct levels of reality while setting high-speed cameras in motion to make the action sequences particularly dynamic and fluid.\n",
        "A must-see among genre fans, especially guys in their teens and 20s, for whom the script's pretentious mumbo-jumbo of undergraduate mythology, religious mysticism and technobabble could even be a plus rather than a dramatic liability.\n",
        "There's not much humor to keep it all life-size, and by the final stretch it's become bloated, mechanical, and tiresome.\n",
        "Another slice of overlong, high concept hokum.\n",
        "For those who have been waiting for movies to catch up with the graphic possibilities of comic books, wait no longer: The Matrix is among us.\n",
        "The Matrix soars with its feet in the air -- the rest crash-lands.\n",
        "A wildly cinematic futuristic thriller that is determined to overpower the imagination, The Matrix combines traditional science-fiction premises with spanking new visual technology in a way that almost defies description.\n",
        "Silly and dense!\n",
        "The Matrix is too much of an outer-limits head-trip to resist!\n",
        "The Matrix did not bore me. It interested me so much, indeed, that I wanted to be challenged even more.\n",
        "A blast of Holly-Kong glitz that never approaches the stylistic cohesiveness of, say, John Woo's Face/Off or the charisma of that film's propulsive star John Travolta.\n",
        "Keanu Reeves makes a lean, strikingly beautiful tabula rasa hero, twisting out of the way of bullets that elongate like silver beads of mercury, and he's partnered by the equally hard, blank, and androgynously gorgeous Carrie-Anne Moss.\n",
        "The Matrix serves up so much visual wizardry and thought-provoking ideas that even the inevitable Silver touch -- a finale with more bullets than the opening of Saving Private Ryan -- can't destroy the magic.\n",
        "A more technically dazzling synthesis of action choreography and cutting-edge computer graphics has not been seen since James Cameron's T2.\n",
        "The Matrix is the coolest -- a journey into a genuinely original vision of our cyberfuture that will have you checking your own reality by the time it's over.\n",
        "The Matrix is mainly also an exercise in outrageous style over substance featuring flowing trenchcoats, sunglasses at night, and LOTS of guns.\n",
        "The most salient things any prospective viewer need know is that Keanu Reeves makes a strikingly chic Prada model of an action hero.\n",
        "Frank, intimate, touching, with an emotional immediacy that is killing.\n",
        "There's not a single encounter in The Dreamlife of Angels that isn't vivid and emotionally full.\n",
        "Completely absorbing, almost rudely poignant.\n",
        "As raw and immediate as it is heartfelt.\n",
        "It's so graceful and intelligent and complicated in its depiction of human interaction that it takes the notion of a remarkably assured directorial debut to a new level.\n",
        "Heralds a humanist cinema that neither shortchanges our minds nor cheapens what's in our hearts.\n",
        "We aren't just watching Isa and Marie endure the tiny triumphs and hardships of their lives; we're experiencing those ups and downs alongside them.\n",
        "[Bouchez and Regnier have] fleshed out portraits of a depth rarely seen on screen.\n",

        "Zonca shows an extraordinary ability to get into the female psyche.\n",
        "The movie understands what few American movies admit: Not everyone can afford the luxury of following their hearts.\n",
        "Entertaining, but material doesn't develop the full, edgy potential that similar paranoid-triangle efforts realized.\n",
        "Audiences will walk out of the theater shocked to find that only 70 minutes have gone by.\n",

        "Good writing, good direction, good acting. What a concept.\n",
        "An entertaining, clever black comedy!\n",
        "A disaster film with an exceedingly witty premise. Instead of a terrorist, volcano, or extraterrestrial invasion, catastrophe is precipitated by the madcap behavior of rash and reckless American youth.\n",

        "Flat-out the best thing I've seen all year!\n",
        "Derivative as it is, Go has a powerful personality of its own.\n",

        "High-spirited entertainment!\n",
        "Having two directors, and a different choreographer for each fight sequence, gives the movie a split personality -- and neither personality is particularly enjoyable to meet.\n",
        "Amusing all the way and not something Chan fans should skip.\n",
        "It's all pretty dumb, but if you're in the mood for this sort of thing, you won't have a bad time.\n",
        "The emphasis here is on farce rather than action, to an extent that may disappoint hard-core martial arts fanatics.\n",
        "Most of what transpires is low-key, affectionate comedy and a fair amount of fun.\n",
        "Cookie's Fortune is a wittily diagrammed portrait of a small town shaken to its roots by this deceptive calamity. The movie, though, never really becomes more than a diagram.\n",
        "The deceptively modest Cookie's Fortune may or not be Robert Altman's best film in years, but it is certainly his most pleasurable.\n",
        "What's so distinctively charming is the easygoing tone, which manages to turn black comedy into a strangely gentle, touching and delicate affair.\n",
        "This movie delivers agreeable performances and a charming, amusing story that offers little in the way of substance.\n",
        "Cookie's Fortune is Robert Altman's sunniest film, a warm-hearted comedy that somehow manages to deal with death and murder charges without even containing a real villain.\n",
        "One well-telegraphed disclosure is heartwarmingly self-congratulatory, the other genealogical bombshell totally inconsequential.\n",
        "Altman's folkloric feints and throwaways are very easy on the eyes; he shows off his townspeople with such affection that after a while they begin to glow. The movie is a jaunty little jape.\n",
        "Altman's digressive, shaggy-dog style turns out to be well-suited to Southern Gothic.\n",
        "Robert Altman has delivered a lot of surprises in his long directing career, and his new comedy, Cookie's Fortune, is one of the most refreshing -- not because it's so good, but because it's so sweet and affectionate.\n",
        "The sweet assurance and guerrilla wit of Robert Altman's vintage ensemble films makes a serenely captivating return.\n",
        "The movie is about love -- or, rather, about their grand ideas of romance. It is comforting to think that we can love so powerfully that fate itself wheels and turns at the command of our souls.\n",
        "If you like your murder tales full of plot twists and turns, and you don't get thrown off by the performances, then this one is as twisty as a snake.\n",
        "A high-quality bad movie!\n",
        "Once the thud of its wooden dialogue has settled into a deadly mechanical clomp -- about 10 minutes into the film -- you wonder why this risible movie didn't go straight to video.\n",
        "The movie becomes so convoluted in its wry-noir scheme and narrative twisteroos, it turns banal and wearisome.\n",
        "A neo-noir that puts the 'lack' in black comedy!\n",
        "Goodbye Lover is not so much a story as some kind of a board game, with too many pieces and not enough rules.\n",
        "It carefully sets up a powder keg of conflicting relationships and affairs but instead of building the natural tension, it opts for a series of gotcha's.\n",
        "This inventive animated film, which takes Linklater back to his roots in Austin and Slacker, represents a summation of all the philosophical concerns that have defined him as spokesperson for Gen-X.\n",
        "The endless philosophising is a bit sophomoric and more jokes would help, but this is one of a kind that grows more absorbing the longer it runs.\n",
        "For a movie heralded as the cutting edge of visual innovation, Waking Life is disappointingly dull in every other respect.\n",
        "If there was ever a film that made ontological exploration fun, this is it.\n",
        "Exhilarating, transporting, funny and haunting -- and at times maddeningly heady or narcotically logy -- Waking Life doesn't compare to any other movie experience I've ever had.\n",
        "An instant cult classic, one that's tailor-made for multiple viewings and bound to be popular among college students.\n",
        "To paraphrase the enduring title of a new-wave album, it is pure pop for dream people.\n",
        "It may not be for everyone -- the movie requires a high tolerance for statements such as 'there's only one instant, and it's now, and it's eternity' -- but it's like nothing else in theaters right now.\n",
        "Adds up to little more than a series of disconnected impressions, but it holds interest despite an almost nonexistent narrative, and that's something.\n",
        "Often surreal, Waking Life transcends boundaries of technology, imagination.\n",
        "It's thoughtful, provocative, liberating and fun.\n",
        "Minute 69 evolves several geological epochs later into Minute 70 -- and then there are 27 minutes left to go!\n",
        "Linklater mixed his grad-student-on-speed discourses with a few genuinely engrossing yakkers.\n",
        "Like My Dinner with Andre and other appallingly smart movies, this one reminded me that I need to read more books and watch less television.\n",
        "Anyone who finds value in wondering who we are or why we're here, what's real and what's not, should be overjoyed to find a theatrical release with the same sense of curiosity.\n",
        "A smart, sensuous and sensory mind trip that caroms around a universe of thought.\n",
        "The fusion of dream sequences and evocative landscapes makes the characters' feverish sense of living at the edge of reality contagious.\n",
        "Kate Winslet, luscious in a brilliantly colored caftan and flushed from the heat of an African sun, makes a beautiful hippie, circa 1972, in Hideous Kinky.\n",
        "Kate Winslet continues an uninterrupted line of fine performances with the modest yet affecting Hideous Kinky.\n",
        "MacKinnon draws terrific performances from all involved (Winslet bravely refusing to court our sympathies), lets character, mood and meaning take precedence over story, and assembles a great music track as a bonus. Spot on.\n",
        "It augurs well for the long-term integrity of her career that Winslet in this movie doesn't try to ingratiate herself with the audience.\n",
        "While there are all the usual misadventures and colorful characters, the mother/daughter and sister/sister bonds form the gel that holds everything together and gives Hideous Kinky a unique identity.\n",
        "Thanks in part to Kate Winslet's adventurous performance, it's a more vivid and even affecting movie than it deserves to be.\n",
        "Winslet suffers from the movie's inability to give a fuller picture of Julia, and in some ways she just seems too grounded, too sensible to carry off the character's flightiness.\n",
        "Ms. Winslet movingly captures Julia in all her obliviousness and optimism, then watches how she awakens in ways she least expected.\n",
        "The movie's tension comes from our own uneasiness about the mother, who with the best intentions seems to be blundering into trouble.\n",
        "Screenwriter Billy MacKinnon had to have struggled to write convincing dialogue about searching for spiritual enlightenment. Much of what comes out of Julia's mouth sounds like babble.\n",
        "Even if the script (written by the director and Mateo Gil) and direction are patchy, the obsessive theme is gripping.\n",
        "This is so smart, mischievous and stylish, you'll instantly want to see it again.\n",
        "If you're the type who doesn't mind jigsaw puzzles unassembling themselves as you assemble them, if you enjoy enigmas and don't need explanations, the film just might work for you.\n",
        "For adventurous filmgoers, though, this Spanish import offers something off the beaten path and a chance to play the coffee-shop game: Could This Screenplay Be Saved?\n",
        "The cumbersome, fantastical plot twists of its last 40 minutes render the whole thing unfathomable.\n",
        "Amenabar may drop the ball with a surprise happy ending, but the real shock is that when Cesar finally opens his eyes, you feel he's earned it.\n",
        "While it will not get the kind of wide release necessary to make a big splash in this country, those who see it will not quickly forget the experience.\n",
        "A film with enough intellectual meat on its stylish bones to give more adventurous moviegoers something to chew on afterward.\n",
        "A mundane sitcom with feature pretensions, the kind where the comic 'situation' is simply a coat-rack for hanging a rag-tag assortment of inflated sight gags and telegraphed punch lines.\n",
        "Spade serves as both star and co-writer of this lame, crass romantic comedy. Most of the jokes he's written fall flat, and his delivery isn't much better.\n",
        "Nothing but a cynical, astonishingly inept attempt to copy Mary's formula.\n",
        "It makes Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls seem like Shakespeare in Love.\n",
        "Spade's wise-ass persona grows tiresome fast.\n",
        "There's not enough story to get you interested in Dylan's plight and not enough laughs to compensate for the lack of a story.\n",
        "Lost & Found is such a low-class, low-laughs rip-off that it makes \"Mary\" resemble a Noel Coward comedy of manners!\n",
        "Will soon be lost on the trash-heap of failed comedies.\n",
        "The picture shamelessly steals gags from the vastly superior There's Something About Mary.\n",
        "There's precious little to boogie about in Lost & Found!\n",
        "A movie about characters of limited intelligence, who wander through the lonely wastes of ancient and boring formulas.\n",
        "Maybe Adam Sandler isn't so bad after all.\n",
        "Why was the sight of scrawny Woody Allen kissing pretty Diane Keaton never revolting, while scrawny David Spade kissing beautiful Sophie Marceau in Lost & Found is the creepiest cinematic sight of the year?\n",
        "If the standards for feature films starring former Saturday Night Live cast members weren't already so low, you could be forgiven for thinking Lost & Found was dragging them down.\n",
        "It would be difficult to imagine material more wrong for Spade than Lost & Found.\n",
        "Can't decide whether it wants to charm or gross out its audience!\n",
        "Too many of the jokes are predictable, and, as a result, not especially funny.\n",
        "A rancid little nothing of a movie!\n",
        "Pushing Tin loses track of itself, and the source of its dramatic, manic energy.\n",

        "A refreshing, funny character-driven treat.\n",
        "A lively flight!\n",
        "Seems to devolve into a season's worth of hokey compacted episodes, with every 15 minutes showcasing a dramatic device more outlandishly cheesy than the last!\n",
        "Predictable.\n",
        "A slick, fast film!\n",
        "A textured, smashingly original dark comedy!\n",
        "John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton take hold of a scene and shake it awake and make it live.\n",
        "The treatment of this touchy material is impressive, neither gratuitous nor mincing, but this 1999 satirical comedy doesn't really go anywhere.\n",
        "An instant classic, Alexander Payne's 1999 high school comedy seems even more scathing now that we're losing control of our own election machinery.\n",
        "Election at first has the feel of a simple work. But don't let that fool you; it's a complex, deep tale.\n",
        "You've got to laugh at Witherspoon's tightly wound Little Miss Perfect, rising at dawn to do her hair and encase herself in a preppy look before baking cupcakes to pass out at school as vote-getters in her campaign for student council president.\n",
        "A dark, insidiously funny satire on the self-involved ways otherwise rational people can allow narrow personal agendas to lead them astray to the point of self-destruction.\n",
        "This remarkable film may be set in high school, but its satiric take on moral corruption, political chicanery, adultery and seduction is anything but juvenile.\n",
        "The screenplay, by Payne and Jim Taylor, delights!\n",
        "What is it about high-school overachievers that gets the goat of movie directors these days?\n",
        "It showed promise and considerable competence.\n",
        "So blackly funny it hurts!\n",
        "A black comedy that takes off in unexpected directions.\n",
        "One of the funniest, shrewdest, smartest movies in recent memory!\n",
        "Cool!\n",
        "Reese Witherspoon hits her full stride in Election!\n",
        "Election is a bracingly intelligent adult comedy that shrewdly captures adolescence.\n",
        "A tart study in teacher-student relations, adolescent pecking orders and the nasty vicissitudes of living in a world of haves and have-nots.\n",
        "Reese Witherspoon is proving to be one of the most versatile actresses of her generation.\n",
        "A quartet of solid performances only adds to the movie's strength.\n",
        "Fresh, fast, funny and full of insight!\n",
        "I just don't happen to like puzzle films of any kind, but I must credit Mr. Cronenberg with more intellectual depth than most of his fellow pessimistic movie pranksters.\n",
        "Dark, delirious fun.\n",
        "It's good art direction in search of an idea.\n",
        "Jennifer Jason Leigh is an ideal Cronenberg heroine, projecting a personality that is smart, wary and capable of obsessiveness.\n",
        "This darkly sexual sci-fi horror variant by Cronenberg makes The Matrix look like child's play.\n",
        "[It's] meant to have a whiff of the philosophical, even if its intellectual ambition seems mostly limited to spelling affectations.\n",
        "The Matrix is mainstream sci-fi, but eXistenZ, written by Cronenberg, is much stranger; it creates a world where organic and inorganic are not separate states, but kind of chummy.\n",
        "Because of the potential of the idea and Cronenberg's reputation as a film maker, it's a real disappointment to watch eXistenZ fall apart the way it does.\n",
        "It's a pleasure to find the brooding Cronenberg turning out a trifle, even if it's a dark trifle.\n",
        "Mendes has made a troubling film that wrestles with big themes and touchy subjects, even if it is set in an overly familiar milieu.\n",
        "Bolstered by Thomas Newman's score, spot-on set design and the brilliant source material, \"Revolutionary Road\" is a darkly effective portrait of an Eisenhower-era couple who fall tragically short of reaching Camelot.\n",
        "This is a sobering, well-observed film that doesn't fully hit the mark but sets up enough pleasing ideas to chew on regarding ambition, marriage and ideals of how to live one's life, individually and as a couple.\n",
        "If Revolutionary Road had been filmed back in 1961, when the novel came out, it would have been timely and powerful.\n",
        "Bitter, nerve-wracking, ugly and relentless, Revolutionary Road is Big Drama done right, a mesmerizing look at desperate lives, wrong moves and spoiled dreams that hits hard right from the beginning and never lets up.\n",
        "Viewers in the mood for rip-snorting marital combat should go ahead and partake, but they must prepare to leave the theatre in a state of profound depression.\n",
        "Unlike the novel, which you can set aside and take a break, with the film version of Revolutionary Road, you're in for the duration, and it's ultimately too much to take.\n",
        "Winslet gives a fearless performance here. It's not her fault her husband has shrouded it in Taste.\n",
        "This film is so good it is devastating. A lot of people believe their parents didn't understand them. What if they didn't understand themselves?\n",
        "Like its cinematic kin, Frost/Nixon and Doubt, this, too, is a delicately crafted, prestige project whose translation to screen doesn't deliver the original's amazements.\n",
        "Sam Mendes has worked in this territory before with his Oscar-winning American Beauty. Revolutionary Road is a better movie because it doesn't rely on such blatant caricatures.\n",
        "Revolutionary Road is easily the best-acted film of 2008, and one of the most corrosive.\n",
        "[A] devastating if flawed adaptation of the Richard Yates novel.\n",
        "Revolutionary Road gets my vote as the best American film of 2008.\n",
        "A heartbreakingly sad yet remarkable film from director Sam Mendes.\n",
        "Somehow the film fails to inspire more than admiration, never reaching the same heights of empathy achieved by less impeccable treatments of the same topic.\n",
        "Sam Mendes's spiritually depleted film exerts an undeniable pull as its beautiful, doomed protagonists navigate the ennui of adult life. Revolutionary Road provides an apt bookend to a holiday season drenched in fatalistic gloom.\n",
        "The self-dramatization is harder to capture, sometimes coming off as false moments between the actors, yet this is still a troubling story of two good people who can't live with the truth that they're as ordinary as their neighbors.\n",
        "Sam Mendes, the director of Revolutionary Road, injects a few milligrams of hope into his film version of the 1961 Richard Yates novel, an excoriating portrait of a mid-1950s marriage built on sticks, straw and delusion.\n",
        "A film that, by the end, turns into a far more unsettling haunted-house story than The Amityville Horror.\n",
        "It's a superficial but entertaining caper that's a good, old-fashioned yarn.\n",
        "Lives up to its title -- spend 100-plus minutes with this lacklustre thing and you definitely feel snookered.\n",
        "The legendary Sean Connery and the enthralling Catherine Zeta-Jones are less than the sum of their wonderful parts!\n",
        "Entrapment simply reminds us again how far Hollywood is from the true legacies of its greatest genre directors.\n",
        "Another soulless, by-the-numbers attempt to resurrect a genre that made money for the studios in the past.\n",
        "[Directed] with cool efficiency.\n",
        "The kind of slick, sleek entertainment that shows audiences a good time mostly because of an elaborately tricky plot.\n",
        "An adventure movie without two brain cells to rub together. But Connery's sad and reflective acting gives the movie depth and poignancy.\n",
        "It's often all too easy to see where the plot's headed; tiny holes and bigger ones open up under the story.\n",
        "A snare for all those lured to theaters by Connery's name, Zeta-Jones' beauty, and the false promise of an enjoyable caper film.\n",
        "Connery and Zeta-Jones not only look great together, they work well together, too.\n",
        "Manufactures sparks when none are naturally forthcoming.\n",
        "A movie with a preposterous plot, exotic locations, absurd action sequences, and so much chemistry between attractive actors that we don't care.\n",
        "A wildly expensive movie full of computers, nonsense and violence, a film where wit, romance, elegance - everything - is sacrificed on the altar of giganticism, cliche and over-the-top action.\n",
        "Maybe 90 seconds of viable and sustained humor at the end.\n",
        "Its mixture of slapstick humour and gore -- produced by the flying fingers -- gives new meaning to the phrase digital effects.\n",
        "Even pretensions toward the humorous and hip cannot save this blood-drenched film from its innate tastelessness!\n",
        "Dumb, blood-soaked, undeniably kinetic teen Guignol bash!\n",
        "A disastrous attempt to mix comedy and horror!\n",
        "A lame-ass horror comedy!\n",
        "Proof that when moral crusaders come to hang Hollywood, Hollywood will supply the rope!\n",
        "A heavy-handed disappointment saturated in tired movie blood.\n",
        "Deliberately, gleefully orchestrated camp.\n",
        "Excruciatingly unfunny!\n",
        "When a movie sets out to be awful and achieves its goal, does that make it a success?\n",
        "It's a bad thriller and a bad comedy!\n",
        "Too calculated by half and underwritten by about as much, as witlessly unaware of its faltering sense of comedy as its stoner-dude heroes are of everyday reality.\n",
        "A major buzzkill!\n",
        "Creepy in all the wrong ways.\n",
        "Samples other teen horror movies like a video DJ with a tape deck, exhibiting high spirits and a crazed comic energy!\n",
        "I admit to having chuckled once; that's why the movie gets a generous one star instead of none.\n",
        "A teen comedy even more wasted than its bleary-eyed heroes.\n",
        "The strength of this agreeable comedy, directed by Simon Shore from a screenplay by Patrick Wilde, is that it makes even the tiniest sexual encounters seem emotionally momentous.\n",
        "Fresh, funny and thoroughly engaging.\n",
        "An issue movie, a comedy, and a love story, this is pretty good at being all three.\n",
        "The film is grounded in genuine emotions and its knowing humour serves it well. I laughed like a drain.\n",
        "The movie bravely goes where too many other films have gone before.\n",
        "Yes, we've heard the tale before, but somehow it just never gets stale: Welcome to another instalment of Romeo and Romeo.\n",
        "Shore and Wilde have done an admirable job in re-imagining Wilde's play as a movie, and they've created a wrenching, thoughtful entertainment that incorporates considerable comic relief.\n",
        "Get Real is a sweet-natured coming-out comedy from England that seems to be coming out about 10 years too late.\n",
        "It offers a far more realistic and compelling vision of teen-age growing pains and peer pressure than any of the recent high-school movies from Hollywood.\n",
        "The movie is sound in all the right ways; it argues that we are as we are, and the best thing to do is accept that.\n",
        "Wilde's script, which has a weakness for mild, snickering double entendres, is notable for its near-total reliance on archetypes.\n",
        "In Steven, John, and their friends, Shore gives us individuals worth caring about in situations we can all relate to, regardless of our sexual orientation.\n",
        "The production, mainly because of Michael Curtiz's direction, is unimaginative and badly hoked-up.\n",
        "All this is good melodrama and fair entertainment, but it is much closer to the waltz-time schmalz of Kathleen Norris than to the fox-trot brass of James M. Cain.\n",
        "The archetypal Joan Crawford movie.\n",
        "A class feature, showmanly produced by Jerry Wald and tellingly directed by Michael Curtiz.\n",
        "The film is a chilling demonstration of the fact that, in a patriarchal society, when a woman steps outside the home the end result may be disastrous.\n",
        "Joan Crawford is playing a most troubled lady, and giving a sincere and generally effective characterization of same.\n",
        "A successful pastiche of numerous science fiction films, executed with an entertaining, tongue-in-cheek flair that compensates for its absence in originality.\n",
        "Suspecting that all this plus the cheerleaders might fail to excite, the film-makers also pack in twenty songs.\n",
        "A good-natured, end-of- the-world B-movie, written and directed by Thom Eberhardt, a new film maker whose sense of humor augments rather than upstages the mechanics of the melodrama.\n",
        "Beatty and his team of collaborators have heightened the vibrantly tawdry urban night world of Chester Gould's classic comic strip.\n",
        "Though it looks ravishing, Warren Beatty's longtime pet project is a curiously remote, uninvolving film.\n",
        "This has an appealing two-dimensional comic-book look, but lacks the vision to go with it, not to mention an interesting hero or a feeling for action.\n",
        "A spectacular movie whose technical achievements -- notably the sharp editing -- will surely provide a gauge by which subsequent comic strip films are judged.\n",
        "Summer hasn't officially arrived yet, but it's unlikely to offer a big-budget commercial movie as thoroughly entertaining as this stylish real-life cartoon.\n",
        "For all its superficial pleasures, Dick Tracy ultimately flounders because it provides an audience with nothing to take home and dream about.\n",
        "This is a movie in which every frame contains some kind of artificial effect. An entire world has been built here, away from the daylight and the realism of ordinary city streets.\n",
        "Tracy is Tinseltown's annual celebration of everything that's wrong with itself: the hype, the agent-negotiated star system, the Hollywood 'fun' assembly-line method of copy-cat mediocrity, etc.\n",
        "Dick Tracy is Batman in a fedora -- a much-ballyhooed cartoon noir that's as skimpy on substance as it is burgeoning with jujube-colored, jutt-jawed style.\n",

        "Tries to have it both ways, sending up the adventure genre for laughs while also going for some mild shocks, but the sand slips through its fingers on both counts.\n",
        "A gaudy comic video game splashed onto the screen!\n",
        "The disturbing, embarrassing domestic moments and conflicts are quirky, slightly weird, and yet they boast the shock of recognition because they're so true to the strife in every family.\n",

        "Although the movie's affection for its characters is refreshing, none of them stirs our passions.\n",
        "A nice old-fashioned romance -- how refreshing.\n",
        "It wants to revel in rapture and grand illusions and timeless dreams, yet its vision of love is overly graphed out and willed.\n",
        "The Force isn't with, nor is there much dramatic force behind The Love Letter!\n",
        "A mild and likable enough romantic comedy.\n",
        "An especially affecting love story!\n",
        "Bertolucci and co-writer Clare Peploe seem intent on deconstructing the story's interesting elements at every turn, substituting woolliness for clarity, atmospherics for real emotion and an often condescending, armchair-liberal naivete for real political\n",
        "It's a film about the limits of art, about civilization at this moment of flux, and about a gentle connection between a man and a woman.\n",
        "This is a deeply engrossing, often exquisite film by someone who knows visuals. It's sensory, sensual, handmade.\n",
        "What an unexpected gift.\n",
        "Given Bertolucci's impish leanings, the self-referential sequences may merely be gags. If so, they're among a half-dozen others that backfire.\n",

        "A purposefully romantic exploration of the nonverbal connections between people that can blossom into love.\n",
        "The film is a moderately involving, oddly lighthearted look at the connection between love, obsession, and sacrifice that is somewhat marred by instances of overwrought acting and bad dialogue.\n",
        "Not a film so much as a filmed idea. That could be interesting, but alas it is a very bad idea.\n",
        "The director's eye for baroque black-and-white imagery puts him behind only Bava and Welles, while the film's sharp social satire gives heft to its ambition.\n",
        "By any standard, a long strange trip.\n",
        "Infus[es] a similar unearthly cadenceo the swashbuckling genre that Jodorowski did to the western with El Topo.\n",
        "These trials suggest a goofy, sprawling, all-purpose allegory so overstuffed with symbolism that it plays as a kind of epic spoof of the form.\n",
        "Making the farcical tenor of the recent Indiana Jones film feel like a paragon of dramatic and archaeological integrity, this phoned-in action threequel doesn't even have the good grace to deliver on its title and feature any mummies\n",
        "I was never a fan of the first two, but those are masterpieces compared to this clunk 'o junk.\n",
        "For a movie about the undead, this lacks any supernatural chills, and by the time its obligatory final showdown arrives, it seems as hollow as the terra cotta soldiers brought to life by CGI.\n",
        "The best news about this clangorous clunker is that it may well have vanquished the Mummy franchise.\n",
        "Remarkably, the plot has much in common with Hellboy II: The Golden Army, yet that bundle of fun has enough vision to make even its Barry Manilow interlude seem appropriate.\n",
        "The story is no more than a thread stitching set pieces of increasing implausibility and ineptitude.\n",
        "This Mummy movie is really two movies: a good adventure epic, with all the Chinese people, and a wan one, with O'Connells and the other the Westerners.\n",
        "If movies were people, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor would be a total bimbo: nice-looking and kind of fun sometimes, but so unbearably empty and dumb that it doesn't matter.\n",
        "Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is more of the same -- and yet less.\n",
        "The new Mummy is, how can I put it? Just freakin' awful.\n",
        "The action beats are the same as the earlier Mummys -- with planes, guns, digital creatures and vast armies of the risen-dead having at it. The missing ingredient here seems to be the fun.\n",
        "This movie wasn't so much created as calculated.\n",
        "The third installment of the Mummy franchise, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, is by far the weakest.\n",
        "What's with outsourcing mummies to China? Do the undead work for lower wages there? Did Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon take place on the Nile?\n",
        "'Here we go again,' sighs adventurer Rick O'Connell in The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, and he's not the only one to notice that things are starting to look awfully familiar.\n",
        "As the shape-shifting baddie, Li spends most of the movie running around under extensive digital makeup, which renders his casting pointless, since it could be anybody under there. He also, at one point, turns into a giant three-headed dragon. No, really.\n",
        "If it weren't for all that inept banter, this might have been a different film indeed.\n",
        "It's serviceable summer twaddle, but you might as well see Hellboy II: The Golden Army -- similar plot, much better film.\n",
        "Superman doesn't have enough conviction or courage to be solidly square and dumb; it keeps pushing smarmy big emotions at us -- but half-heartedly.\n",
        "It's the simple, earth-bound quality of the film that makes this comic-book fantasy soar.\n",
        "The film is best when it takes itself seriously, worst when it takes the easy way out in giggly camp -- as it does, finally and fatally, when Lex Luthor enters the action.\n",
        "By keeping the spectacular possibilities open, through the opening scenes of the destruction of Krypton, and the subsequent growth to manhood of the planet's only son on the plains of the Midwest, the film allows naivete and knowingness to coexist.\n",
        "Superman is good, clean, simple-minded fun...\n",
        "Superman is a pure delight...\n",
        "Magnify James Bond's extraordinary physical powers while curbing his sex drive and you have the essence of Superman, a wonderful, chuckling, preposterously exciting fantasy.\n",
        "Along with its 1980 sequel, no live-action version has so effectively captured the essence of the characters.\n",
        "Let's face it, times change, and Superman and friend have sweetly embraced the spirit of the '80s as well as each other.\n",
        "As good a matinee movie as could be imagined.\n",
        "A solid, classy, cannily constructed piece of entertainment which gets down to action almost immediately.\n",
        "The combination of Richard Donner's superb original casting and visual attack with Lester's wit and his ear for sound proves a pretty formidable alliance.\n",
        "Superman II begins in midstream, and never looks back...\n",
        "Superman II is a marvelous toy.\n",
        "Both Kidder and Reeve shine.\n",
        "Putting its emphasis on broad comedy at the expense of ingenious plotting and technical wizardry, it has virtually none of the mythic or cosmic sensibility that marked its predecessors.\n",
        "Enjoyable, nevertheless.\n",
        "It's a cinematic comic book, shallow, silly, filled with stunts and action, without much human interest.\n",
        "Anyone who has been following the Superman saga will find this installment enjoyable enough, but some of the magic is missing.\n",
        "The earlier films in the series were far from perfect, but at their best they had some flair and agreeable humor, qualities this one sorely lacks.\n",
        "By ordinary movie standards it's awful, but fans of cinematic dementia should have fun for about half an hour.\n",
        "About as dreary as a summit conference in Belgium.\n",
        "The Superman series gets more and more whimsically outrageous as it goes along.\n",
        "One of the cheesiest movies ever made.\n",
        "More sluggish than a funeral barge, cheaper than a sale at K mart, it's a nerd, it's a shame, it's Superman IV.\n",
        "A nifty thriller for the chiller trade.\n",
        "Well mounted, nicely directed, and includes cast of capable artists.\n",
        "A strangely literary and leisurely monster movie, laced with amusing gothic doodles.\n",
        "The set, shot in a style reminiscent of the German Expressionist classics, is superb.\n",
        "No masterpiece but better than its reputation ...\n",
        "The thought that he may yet return for further adventures with his body and Lugosi's sconce fills us with mortal terror. That is the most fearful prospect which the picture manages to convey.\n",
        "Peter Cushing gets every inch of drama from the leading role, making almost believable the ambitious urge and diabolical accomplishment.\n",
        "The whole thing in fact looks surprisingly tacky for a film which sparked a box-office bonanza.\n",
        "[A] routine horror picture, which makes no particular attempt to do anything more important than scare you with corpses and blood ...\n",
        "It's a good entry of its type.\n",
        "Despite all the accepted props, from the lonely Southern plantation set in a miasmic bog to the squeaking bats and creaking coffins, this thriller is a pretty pallid offering.\n",
        "The script is far from wonderful, and offers Siodmak little to get his teeth into, notwithstanding a beautifully atmospheric first entry for the Count (Chaney and coffin rising from the misty depths of a lake) and an effective finale.\n",
        "The Wolf Man is a compactly-knit tale of its kind, with good direction and performances by an above par assemblage of players, but dubious entertainment.\n",
        "A stodgy Universal thriller from 1941, redeemed by a name-heavy cast and by Lon Chaney Jr.'s lumbering, affable performance in the title role.\n",
        "Without any build-up either by the scriptwriter or director, he is sent onstage, where he, looks a lot less terrifying and not nearly as funny as Mr. Disney's big, bad wolf.\n",
        "There's undeniable magic within the staid format.\n",
        "Most of the jokes that might have seemed jolly fun on stage now appear obvious and even flat. The sparkle's gone.\n",
        "The wit is too weak to sustain a film, and the songs all sound the same.\n",
        "A string of hummable songs gives it momentum, Gray's admirably straight-faced narrator holds it together, and a run on black lingerie takes care of almost everything else.\n",
        "Viewed on video simply as a movie, without the midnight sideshow, it's cheerful and silly, and kind of sweet, and forgettable.\n",
        "Set the template for a decade of alien invasions.\n",
        "The resourcefulness shown in building the plot groundwork is lacking as the yarn gets into full swing. Cast members, headed by Margaret Sheridan and Kenneth Tobey, fail to communicate any real terror.\n",
        "The film has more frissons than most of today's mega-budget productions, simply because it has the grace to construct a meaningful situation and coherent characters.\n",
        "The overall message of The Thing emerges as distinctly hawkish. Reactionary or not, though, it's still a masterpiece.\n",
        "Picture has been smartly fashioned to take advantage of all the tricks of science-fiction and 3-D.\n",
        "[A] scary black-and-white SF effort from 1953.\n",
        "Merely mildly diverting, not stupendous.\n",
        "The 3-D process leaves the image somewhat murky, but you can discern sparks of authentic pulp poetry throughout.\n",
        "Spielberg's calculations turn out to be more prominent than any effects they could possibly produce, and the less pretentious 1953 version by producer George Pal emerges as more likable.\n",
        "The film succeeds as pure sensation, an exacting distillation of fear.\n",
        "Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds is huge and scary, moving and funny-another capper to a career that seems like an unending succession of captivations.\n",
        "Overall, the film is too lacking in feeling to provide a recognizably human experience.\n",
        "It's a thrilling ride...[but] this bountiful pot of signifiers leaves a caustic aftertaste.\n",
        "War of the Worlds is taut, gripping and surprisingly dark filmmaking.\n",
        "H.G. Wells wouldn't recognize his 1898 alien-invasion novel, The War of the Worlds, in Steven Spielberg's updated film version. But Wells could probably relate to the ensuing fear and panic.\n",
        "There's stuff to make you go 'Wow!' but nothing you'll remember the next day.\n",
        "It's as if the aliens landed and everyone died so that Tom Cruise could grow up one more time.\n",
        "[B]y far the biggest, loudest and most elaborate adaptation of the H.G. Wells classic.\n",
        "The imagery is startling not just for its symbolic resonances, but for the breathless intensity with which it sears the screen.\n",
        "War of the Worlds may not stand up well to careful inspection and it may not be the smartest science fiction film brought to the screen, but it is an intense, visceral experience.\n",
        "War of the Worlds is an attack-of-the-aliens disaster film crafted with sinister technological grandeur -- a true popcorn apocalypse.\n",
        "Extravagant in movie terms but stingy in emotional ones, it embodies all of Spielberg's bad impulses and almost none of his good ones.\n",
        "War of the Worlds' is a picture without a thought in its pretty head: the Tom Cruise movie to end all Tom Cruise movies.\n",
        "An important film.\n",
        "Meticulously detailed and expertly paced and photographed, with sights so spectacular and terrible that viewers will have to consciously remind themselves to close their mouths when their jaws drop open.\n",
        "Urgent and pungent.\n",
        "Its exploitation of tragic iconography -- just to amp up the screams, tug some tears and sell a few more million movie tickets -- should be deplored.\n",
        "When it comes to searing and iconic visual imagery, Spielberg is still the best filmmaker around.\n",
        "The film is too lazy to provide any actual jokes with its send-up of the genre.\n",
        "Short on thrills and laughs.\n",
        "Craven tries to do this 'veggie-man' horror in a suitable DC Comics style; and with Louis Jourdan as arch-villain 'Arcane', not to mention Adrienne Barbeau (Mrs John Carpenter) as the Thing's object of desire, he's definitely on the right track.\n",
        "One of those movies that fall somewhere between buried treasures and guilty pleasures.\n",
        "[The film] wants desperately to be funny and, from time to time, it is. However, you might wish it would trust the audience to discover the humor for itself.\n",
        "This is a film about deeply confused people that seems likely to put viewers in a state of deep confusion for most of its running time.\n",
        "Let down by some mediocre acting, pedestrian dialogue and slow pacing!\n",
        "The roles are underwritten and, especially in D'Onofrio's case, overacted.\n",
        "Wildly uneven!\n",
        "[A] stylish but overplotted and ultimately illogical combination of science fiction, mystery and romance.\n",
        "A marvelous film right up until its inappropriate ending leaves you feeling betrayed.\n",
        "Thirteenth Floor tries to be complex but is merely confusing.\n",
        "The makers of The Thirteenth Floor never figured out how to build a dramatically intriguing story around the concept!\n",
        "An overwrought but underwritten sci-fi item.\n",
        "Works on a more human level, although more through philosophical pondering than well-defined characters.\n",
        "This is fascinating stuff and would be more so if the actors brought more energy to it.\n",
        "The fascinating and the mysterious become the silly and occasionally comical.\n",
        "Dull and disappointing!\n",
        "I was moved and captivated throughout its 132 minutes.\n",
        "Its long, fluid takes escort us through space and time, to universal themes and broader topicalities, effortlessly fending off charges of hermetic aestheticism.\n",
        "What had been a realistic work, lyric but realistic, slides into ostentatious symbolism.\n",
        "Angelopoulos' meditation on the meaning of one man's life is genuinely hypnotic in its way of transcending ordinary narrative.\n",
        "Angelopoulos has created another masterpiece, one that recalls such classics as Bergman's Wild Strawberries and Kurosawa's Ikiru.\n",
        "A gorgeous elegy of a film.\n",
        "This is not a masterpiece, but it contains moments of rare beauty and its contemplation of life, death, regret, and memory has a subtle power.\n",
        "Hands-down worst movies of the season!\n",
        "Instinct is the second one in a row that Gooding lifts out of mediocrity by the sheer force of his talent, intelligence and personality.\n",
        "[Hopkins and Gooding Jr.] keep Instinct afloat on its sea of simplisms through a succession of climaxes until at last it reaches its unavoidable ending.\n",
        "Heavy on formula and lean on revelation.\n",
        "Strong performances!\n",
        "Too simplistic and schematic!\n",
        "Instinct\" is a marketing hook attempting to pass itself off as a movie.\n",
        "If there's anything worse than a movie hammered together out of pieces of bad screenplays, it's a movie made from the scraps of good ones.\n",
        "Sloppily structured, snoozily paced!\n",
        "Solid directing and good acting!\n",
        "Gooding is at his best!\n",
        "The bright, crisp design, Wilde's arch eloquence and a classy company help to camouflage the shortcomings.\n",
        "An enjoyable, minor, lustrously shot revamping of Oscar Wilde's play about the perpetually interlocked manners of love and deception.\n",
        "Smooth-flowing direction, a shrewdly pruned script and a top-flight ensemble cast that visibly relishes both the dialogue and one another's perfs make this a tony item for upscale, mature audiences.\n",
        "Parker has made a sensible cinematic translation of Wilde's play, intercutting scenes which would have been played consecutively on the stage.\n",
        "[I]t's likely that Mr. Wilde, who once wrote, 'A poet can survive anything but a misprint,' would have been less than thrilled with the result.\n",
        "Wilde was always about lots more than witty repartee, and as sparkling as his play is as drawing-room comedy, it reveals his concern with the timeless values of unselfish love and forgiveness.\n",
        "[T]his Husband plods and ambles and bears the burden of a soundtrack that resembles a wimpy meditation tape.\n",
        "Much of the four acts of An Ideal Husband, a serious comedy, is constructed out of flip one-liners, most of which remain, though Parker has added a few, all unworthy of the master.\n",
        "An irresistible concoction of brilliant dialogue, sumptuous set design, top-notch acting, and a plot littered with Machiavellian twists.\n",
        "An Ideal Husband works because Wilde created an expert mechanism (kind of slow-motion serious screwball comedy) for manipulating the plot and characters.\n",
        "Our familiarity with the actors, and their comfort in this period setting, lend the piece an unexpected air of naturalism.\n",
        "Parker, who himself adapted Wilde's play for the movie, takes what to purists may be an unforgivable number of liberties with the story, fleshing out the plot and even adding dialogue.\n",
        "[The] film is hardly memorable, but it's amusing enough for two hours, and it never panders or cloys.\n",
        "In adapting the play, Mr. Parker has streamlined and rewritten Wilde's dialogue, keeping some (but not all) of Wilde's biting epigrams and scraping off a lot (perhaps too much) of the Victorian crust.\n",

        "Interspersed with Lola's zigzag swiftness are moments when the action shifts into trancelike tableaux.\n",
        "Run Lola Run's power isn't in celebrating the giddy mixture of testosterone, drugs and new youth culture (i.e., electronica), but in taking the oldest of questions...\n",
        "Run Lola Run is the feverish, wish-fulfillment embodiment of everyone's unspoken dream...\n",

        "A madly spinning top of a movie.\n",
        "It's a furiously kinetic display of pyrotechnics from the director Tom Tykwer, who fuses lightning-fast visual tricks, tirelessly shifting styles and the arbitrary possibilities of interactive storytelling...\n",
        "...a sort of power-pop variation on the mystical time-bending Euro-art movies made by the late Krzysztof Kieslowski.\n",

        "This light yet earnest drama starring Adam Sandler deals openly with one of the most insidious elements in popular filmmaking -- the male screenwriter's relationship with his own father.\n",
        "This lightweight, bubblegum caper synthesises robust, physical humour, self-deprecation and witty one liners. The main problem, as with most other dumb boy pictures, is that the supporting characters are underwritten.\n",
        "Funny-sweet, understand, not bleccchh sweet.\n",
        "Worst of all is the way Sandler wants to have it both ways: to muck around in gross-out humor one minute and then turn schmaltzy the next minute with some fraudulent business about how much he loves the kid.\n",
        "How's this for a novel complaint: Big Daddy just isn't stupid enough.\n",
        "There's no doubt Sandler is talented, but if he persists in believing that, like Elvis, his presence alone covers a multitude of omissions and inconsistencies, he will squander his gift and make a series of forgettable films in the process.\n",
        "The film offers its share of big laughs, but the serious side is sunk by mawkishness and sentimentality.\n",
        "Doesn't offer any of the quasi-adult charm of Sander's more recent The Wedding Singer or the wall-to-wall loopiness of last year's The Waterboy.\n",
        "Adam Sandler's new comedy is being touted as a step forward for him, which I find funnier than anything in the movie.\n",
        "A flimsy sentimental comedy with more product plugs and fewer laughs than might have been hoped for.\n",
        "Big Daddy shows that Sandler the movie persona may be ready for adulthood, but Sandler the moviemaker isn't getting any more mature.\n",
        "Big Daddy is all about Sonny's maturation, but there's nothing new or unexpected about Sandler's latest.\n",
        "Joey Lauren Adams smiles so damn much. It's like she's had this smile surgically sculpted onto her face, like Jack Nicholson's Joker in Batman.\n",
        "Big Daddy is easily the laziest, most slapdash and altogether crummy picture Sandler's done to date.\n",
        "Big Daddy should be reported to the child welfare office.\n",
        "The film's jokes, stretched out over 90 minutes, aren't that funny.\n",
        "Adam Sandler's sweetness just busts out all over. It's a wondrous thing to watch.\n",
        "Sandler has remarkably little funny to do or say in Big Daddy!\n",
        "The actors bring an appealing energy to their simplistic roles, enough so to wring laughs from the most Sandler-resistant audience members.\n",
        "Big Daddy doesn't generate a lot of big laughs. It has a throwaway sweetness, though.\n",
        "Schumacher falls far short of the talent for pop wit that Joe Dante showed in Gremlins and The Howling.\n",
        "The Lost Boys, which attempts to be funny while preserving the shock value of the vampire legend, aims somewhat higher... and misses.\n",
        "There's always room for fancy trash, and this movie -- about a gang of punk vampires terrorizing the new kids in town -- seems capable of providing some. Then the characters open their mouths.\n",
        "Schumacher`s sputtering, short-term approach to the material is a disappointment, because there's something in it that ought to make for a good movie, and from time to time makes The Lost Boys good enough.\n",
        "A horrifically dreadful vampire teensploitation entry.\n",
        "Directed with a cavalier disregard for intelligibility, this has to be one of the most anaemic vampire flicks ever made.\n",
        "It laughs at the form it embraces, adds a rock-and-roll soundtrack and, if you share its serious-satiric attitude, manages to be very funny.\n",
        "When everything is all over, there's nothing to leave the theater with -- no real horrors, no real dread, no real imagination -- just technique at the service of formula.\n",
        "It starts slow, but finishes fast with some clever plot twists. In the end, all is not lost with these boys.\n",
        "An exhilarating hybrid of horror and suburban comedy.\n",
        "Weaves a simple premise into comedy gold.\n",
        "Despite the stagey set-up (it was originally conceived as a play and it shows), the film manages to maintain its humor and energy until the final scene in which Veber suddenly casts aside his delightful meanspiritedness and gets soft-hearted and preachy.\n",
        "Some realist nuances in the characters' behavior become more intriguing than the belabored humor.\n",
        "A sip of sparkling champagne in a moviegoing summer of mostly cheap red wine for teenage winos.\n",
        "The leads fill out their archetypes comfortably, the timing's well pitched, and the narrative moves busily enough. Cinematically, though, there's little of interest.\n",
        "On its own terms, it's an idiot's delight.\n",
        "It's a long time since a French movie has been as funny as The Dinner Game.\n",
        "The funniest film this season.\n",
        "The Dinner Game, which Mr. Veber wrote and directed, is one of his better-constructed comedies of errors.\n",
        "It must be that I just don't get French humor, or at least not of the sort that attracts French movie-goers to theaters like bugs to bright lights.\n",
        "Frank Marshall's sophisticated feature directing debut never indulges in ultimate gross-out effects and carefully chooses both its victims and its means of depicting their dispatch.\n",
        "First-time director Frank Marshall has long been Steven Spielberg's producer, and he's learned the master's lessons well.\n",
        "Designed to reduce the audience to a squirming mass, the film yields plenty of grisly pleasures.\n",
        "That sound you hear in the background is the ''ugh!'' heard round the world. Luckily, ''Arachnophobia'' will also be generating its share of boisterous, nervous laughter.\n",
        "It's a one-joke movie, a funhouse ride, the cinematic equivalent of having a rubber spider thrown in your lap. But it doesn't matter if you reject the wispy script or the plot, which has as much substance as a spider's web; you'll jump every time.\n",
        "Frank Marshall, a constant Spielberg collaborator, makes his directorial debut in this genial horror movie, a sweet infestation that creeps and crawls but wouldn't scare anybody.\n",
        "This is the kind of movie where you squirm out of enjoyment, not terror, and it's probably going to be popular with younger audiences - it doesn't pound you over the head with violence.\n",
        "It gives you the willies in a cheery, presentable way.\n",
        "[An] inspired, self-referential animated musical.\n",
        "Genuinely outrageous and sometimes hilarious -- but size does eventually matter, and all-rounder Trey Parker just can't keep it up for the full 81 minutes.\n",
        "Rude, but inspired.\n",
        "A happy surprise!\n",
        "While there aren't more than a handful of gut-busting, laugh-aloud moments, there is enough sly, slick humor to keep the average viewer chuckling throughout.\n",
        "It's without any redeeming social value whatsoever. And it's funny from beginning to end.\n",
        "Very funny, extremely obscene.\n",
        "Profane, blasphemous and absolutely hilarious, Bigger, Longer & Uncut is easily the funniest of all the high-profile comedies released this year!\n",
        "Even clean-thinking people may be tempted to admit that the thing is shamelessly, raucously hilarious!\n",
        "South Park has a gag-to-laugh ratio even higher than the new Austin Powers.\n",
        "The quite clever satirical moments in this crudely animated filth fest, though, are not remotely worth being dragged through the cinematic sewer.\n",
        "Certain, probably arrested, personalities (like mine) just find this kind of sh*t pretty funny and any attempt to talk your way around that is, as Cartman would say, blowing bubbles out your *ss.\n",
        "Parker and Stone are madly inventive when it comes to details.\n",
        "A more clever diversion than anyone had any right to expect!\n",
        "After Big Daddy, it's almost heartening to see a movie that's not afraid to be upfront about its coarseness, one that doesn't smother its very reason for being with hypocritical sentimentality.\n",
        "Tasteless, scatalogical and very funny!\n",
        "Raunchy, riotously irreverent and thrillingly rangy!\n",
        "The year's most slashing political commentary is not in the new films by Oliver Stone, David Lynch or John Sayles, but in an animated comedy about obscenity.\n",
        "In terms of raw wit and fearless satire, the South Park kids put Mike Myers and Adam Sandler to shame.\n",
        "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut turns out to be the funniest, most risk-taking, most incisive movie of the summer!\n",
        "Another giggly gross-out comedy for teenagers, this one somewhat better than most by virtue of a more satisfying ending.\n",
        "A crude piece of work, spottily acted and directed.\n",
        "More likely to gross out adults than kids.\n",
        "It takes almost 30 intolerably slack minutes to set it up and get it rolling.\n",
        "It casts actors who look plausible and treats sex with honesty and no apologies.\n",
        "Adam Herz's script is wildly uneven but occasionally quite funny.\n",
        "Paul Weitz, who never directed before; Chris Weitz - his brother - who never produced before; and Adam Herz, who never wrote a screenplay before, have cooked up two hilarious hours of impure pow.\n",
        "Unusual in its ability to mix bodily functions humor with a sincere and unlooked-for sense of decency\n",
        "American Pie is both funny and foul, alternately frank and full of it.\n",
        "Most of American Pie just isn't smart or clever enough.\n",
        "The actors are pure Hollywood, with every grin, spoken line, or sad face springing from acting classes and the closely studied performances of other actors.\n",
        "Cheerful and hard-working and sometimes funny!\n",
        "Beyond nauseating and all too familiar!\n",
        "Among this year's bumper crop of shallow teen-age movies, it is the shallowest and the most prurient.\n",
        "Irresistibly raunchy!\n",
        "Absolutely hilarious from beginning to end!\n",
        "Profound and ennobling!\n",
        "The king of gross-out comedy!\n",
        "American Pie is a pretty despicable slice of high-school life.\n",
        "Any kind of conversation, such as the boys' gatherings at a diner, is beyond the powers of filmmaking brothers Paul and Chris Weitz.\n",
        "The machinations and manipulations built into the story it spins are simply too obvious to be taken to heart.\n",
        "Arlington Road is a movie trying so hard for intelligence, quality and deeper meanings, you can almost sense the strain under the celluloid.\n",
        "A flat, formulaic ride!\n",
        "The screenplay stretches the viewer's credulity far beyond the breaking point, asking us to accept dozens of absurd contrivances and coincidences.\n",
        "An imaginative action film!\n",
        "Tight, ingenious!\n",
        "Mostly devoid of suspense!\n",
        "A crisp, suspenseful thriller!\n",
        "A dank, mechanical exercise that refuses to have any fun.\n",
        "A marginal engrosser that's short on staying power.\n",
        "Arlington Road is a dumb, overheated thriller pretending to be a smart, topical one.\n",
        "Arlington Road succeeds at discomforting a viewer and making one apt to look over one's shoulder for a day or two.\n",
        "An engrossing thriller!\n",
        "The climax is so implausible we stop caring and start scratching our heads!\n",
        "The film is delightfully unpredictable, warm, nuanced. It's civilized entertainment.\n",
        "Though you wouldn't know it from Hollywood's kids 'r us obsessions, directors actually can improve as they advance in age.\n",
        "The he-said, she-said shenanigans suggest that high school may be eternal but autumn has its wisdom. In the last scene, the 78-year-old filmmaker brings his favorite conspirator back for a last dance -- it's a vintage performance that invites applause.\n",
        "There's a form of poetic justice in all this, and it gives the film, otherwise straitlaced, its jagged wit: Women on the lookout for love may be fools, but they make sure to turn the men who romance them into even bigger ones.\n",
        "It's a solidly entertaining effort -- the kind of movie that can be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates discerning comedy.\n",
        "If a part of me has resisted and sometimes even resented his mastery, this undoubtedly can be traced to a problem with realism that his work as a whole throws into relief. To put it crudely, why reproduce the real world when we have the thing itself?\n",
        "Eric Rohmer is the KFC of international cinema. The 79-year- old director has been doing just one thing for decades, but he does it right.\n",
        "The latest in a long, rich series of films by the perceptive French director, who tells stories about people we'd like to know, or be.\n",
        "As sublimely warming an experience as the autumn sun that shines benevolently on the vineyard owned by the film's central character, Magali.\n",
        "Muppets from Space proves that, without a solid script, a Muppet movie can be just as bad as any other dud.\n",
        "This new Muppet movie is the funniest I can remember!\n",
        "Teletubbies may come and go, but Muppets are forever.\n",
        "The movie has a clever premise that will appeal to all ages!\n",
        "Doesn't have the right awe and wonder!\n",
        "The new Muppets movie lacks the kind of excitement the first ones generated.\n",
        "A perfectly sweet-natured, passable family entertainment.\n",
        "Smart and winning, this sixth Muppet feature film comes closest to recapturing the pure joy of the 1979 original!\n",
        "Some of this is fun, some of it is extraneous, and by the end of Muppets From Space it's hard to tell the difference.\n",
        "A more entertaining space trip this summer than you-know-what.\n",
        "The balance of character, plot, irreverent humor and innate decency that made some of the earlier Muppet movies so welcome is lost.\n",
        "Thin in its ideas and surprises.\n",
        "Draggy and awfully thin!\n",
        "Muppets From Space will satisfy the little kids, which may be all grown-ups really need in the dog days of summer -- a babysitter with air-conditioning.\n",
        "The Muppets were once devilish and sly, but this ploddingly whimsical musical caper, which uses too many '70s soul songs to signify its rainbow-demographic cred, is enough to make you want to see them get slapped around by the Teletubbies!\n",
        "You can dismiss The Blair Witch Project as a trick. Or you can give in to the treat and savor that rarest of accomplishments in a field notorious for tedium and repetition -- an original horror movie.\n",
        "The thought that Blair Witch Project just might be real makes it much scarier than any of the teen horror flicks that have stumbled along in recent years.\n",
        "The Blair Witch Project\" is the scariest movie I've ever seen. Not the goriest, the grossest, the weirdest, the eeriest, the sickest, the creepiest or the slimiest... Just flat out the scariest.\n",
        "Using the most modest means, Sanchez and Myrick manage to tell a compelling story, create recognizable characters and hold our attention even when there's literally nothing on the screen.\n",
        "I have seen the new face of movie horror and its name is The Blair Witch Project, a groundbreaker in fright that reinvents scary for the new millennium.\n",
        "A cunningly conceived and crafted exercise in suggestibility and terror.\n",
        "[A] creepy tale of witchcraft, murders and ghost sightings.\n",
        "Heather's shaky video work can induce motion sickness -- it looks like combat footage as she bolts through the woods -- but just try turning away.\n",
        "I could tell you the story -- give away every detail -- and The Blair Witch Project would still freeze your blood.\n",
        "The viewer never glimpses anything more than the shadow of a clever movie.\n",
        "What gives the film much of its force and its mounting sense of queasy uncertainty is its narrative method, which ensures that we know no more about the proceedings than the characters do.\n",
        "Where is the suspense? Where is the involvement? Where is the identification?\n",
        "The actors never put a foot wrong; the video diary form allows no artifice, so that as terror mounts, the dread is infectious.\n",
        "If you can handle its unconventional approach, you won't feel as if you're seeing a film so much as witnessing a living nightmare.\n",
        "What can anyone say about The Blair Witch Project that hasn't been trumpeted from a thousand Web sites already?\n",
        "There's no denying the terror in The Blair Witch Project. It's fierce, it's palpable and it gets deep under the skin.\n",
        "In short, the film is a clever, entertaining stunt, no more, no less, and a terrific calling card for its fledgling filmmakers, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez.\n",
        "You don't need buckets of moolah and a zillion computer-generated effects to get a rise out of an audience. Just a little imagination, a little suggestive terror, will do quite nicely.\n",
        "Clever, creepy!\n",
        "At a time when digital techniques can show us almost anything, The Blair Witch Project is a reminder that what really scares us is the stuff we can't see. The noise in the dark is almost always scarier than what makes the noise in the dark.\n",
        "I don't know how a director whose central theme is the loss of humanity can be so uninterested in the minutiae of human speech and behavior.\n",
        "A riveting, thematically probing, richly atmospheric and just occasionally troublesome work, a deeply inquisitive consideration of the extent of trust and mutual knowledge possible between a man and a woman.\n",
        "I kept my eyes wide open all through Eyes Wide Shut and saw more control-freak unreality than visual genius around the edges of the cluttered compositions.\n",
        "Finally, however, it's just a cautionary tale about some very mild, old-fashioned erotic fantasies.\n",
        "Kubrick, exactly in character, has left us as the unchallengeable champion of the enigma.\n",
        "As it rambles on, it makes less and less of the material, rather than more.\n",
        "Well, I'll be damned. A sex movie this summer for grown-ups.\n",
        "[Kubrick's] final, hypnotic, meticulously crafted film... hangs on something as commonplace as a husband's confession of his strange desires.\n",
        "[O]ne of the best things about Eyes Wide Shut... is that it isn't a film of the 90s in most respects but something closer to what movies at their best used to be.\n",
        "Eyes Wide Shut is a masterful, cunning, challenging art movie!\n",
        "For most people, though, a single viewing will be more than enough.\n",
        "A masterpiece!\n",
        "Kubrick may have found, in this very adult and very human sexual awakening, a happy ending at last.\n",
        "It's the most brilliant, most glamorous, yet subtlest movie about sexual desire and sexual jealousy.\n",
        "Quite good in parts and always dazzling to the eye but a letdown all the same.\n",
        "Challenging and richly rewarding!\n",
        "Profound, intimate, provocative, richly ambiguous and spiked with sudden or sustained bursts of deeply knowing humor.\n",
        "For adult audiences, it creates a mesmerizing daydream of sexual fantasy.\n",
        "Eyes Wide Shut turns into a series of haphazard revelations that come to very little.\n",
        "It's a powerful movie without always, or often, being a very good one; watching it is a bit like being inside the twistings and conniptions of a control freak who longs to lose control, only to pull back tighter than ever.\n",
        "Has an easygoing sense of fun, along with one of the more memorable movie monsters of recent years.\n",
        "A funny film!\n",
        "Lake Placid isn't so bad that it's good; it's so bad that it's really bad.\n",
        "Pullman once made a career playing bumbling idiots, but now he seems to play only dashing leading men. He was better at bumblers.\n",
        "What's missing here is Mr. Kelley's stock in trade - a three-act script with snappy dialogue.\n",
        "Laughably stupid, only fitfully scary.\n",
        "Lake Placid combines humor and thrills with remarkable deftness.\n",
        "The funniest film of the summer!\n",
        "There's a special look that actors get - avid yet resigned - when the movie they're starring in is so bad it practically billboards their stalled careers.\n",
        "Dull, jokey, and insubstantial!\n",
        "Ludicrous premise and slim thrills!\n",
        "Lake Placid could easily have been made as a PG-13 movie, or perhaps even a PG. But the better to tempt teen-age audiences, it talks its way into an R.\n",
        "This is just a variant on ten thousand other huge-creature-tryin'-to-kill-me movies.\n",
        "An almost mystifyingly bad movie!\n",
        "Choppy coming-of-age story.\n",
        "An across-the-board delight featuring a spot-on ensemble cast that treats the most awkward and embarrassing moments in the rites of passage with affectionate hilarity.\n",
        "The growing-up stuff is kind of wonderful.\n",
        "Artificial, tension-free.\n",
        "Famuyiwa has kicked up fertile new storytelling territory for black filmmakers.\n",
        "The Wood is a solid debut for director Famuyiwa.\n",
        "Inane coming-of-age comedy.\n",
        "A fair and admirable comedy we haven't quite seen before.\n",
        "Awkward performances, unsure directing flaw The Wood.\n",
        "The Wood paints a fair picture of growing up black, bright and, of all things, without sullen malice or uncorrectable misogyny.\n",
        "This rambling and episodic autobiographical saga of three friends coming of age in Inglewood, Calif. in the '80s is so determined to be likable that it forgets to be interesting.\n",
        "Quaint and refreshing!\n",
        "Since positive images of middle-class black friendships and romance remain rare while gangster tales, drugs and gang gunfire dominate the screen, The Wood gets bonus points.\n",
        "A savvy, good-natured comedy!\n",
        "The Wood spends too much time wallowing in arrested adolescence to make you feel you've traveled anywhere.\n",
        "When will Epps, who was in The Mod Squad, get a picture worthy of his obvious talent?\n",
        "It's about time someone made a movie with black male characters who are believable and funny without being buffoonish.\n",
        "Whoever thought of having evil's final manifestation take the form of a 100-ft. marshmallow deserves the rational mind's eternal gratitude.\n",
        "Only intermittently impressive.\n",
        "Essentially a $30 million version of Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy but not at all a bad time, thanks mainly to Bill Murray's incredibly dry line readings and director Ivan Reitman's maintenance of a moderately coherent tone and plotline.\n",
        "The story of a trio of incompetent 'experts' in the paranormal (Murray, Aykroyd and Ramis), who set up as ghostbusters after they are canned from their college sinecures, is less cynical a construction than it sounds.\n",
        "This movie is an exception to the general rule that big special effects can wreck a comedy.\n",
        "There is more attention to special effects than to humor.\n",
        "There's very little energy in the follow-through, and this time Murray's listlessness seems more anemic than comic.\n",
        "Kids will find the oozing slime and ghastly, ghostly apparitions to their liking and adults will enjoy the preposterously clever dialog.\n",
        "The film is largely an excuse for a cast get-together, with the Ghostbusters, under judicial restraining order after the havoc wreaked in part one, suffering lives of semi-obscurity.\n",
        "Even the special effects are more to the point of the comedy than they were in the first film. For some reason, this appears to leave more room for the sort of random funny business that Mr. Murray and his friends do best.\n",
        "You want more.\n",
        "Hammered together out of the junkiest of elements, the movie rattles along with a pleasing rambunctiousness, tossing off its quips and one-liners and scoring on a remarkably high percentage of them.\n",
        "Call it silly. Call it obvious -- there's nothing more obvious than a shark attack. But this is one of the few big-fish horror films that still has the power to surprise.\n",
        "You might guess that this movie will feature yelling, at least once, 'Let's get the hell outta here!'\n",
        "A fat, irresistible Twinkie of a summer thriller!\n",
        "For action-starved audiences suffering through a summer drought of flying glass and fiery explosions, this cheese barge may hit the spot.\n",
        "A lame Jaws wannabe!\n",
        "A nail-biting rollercoaster ride of thrills and adrenaline.\n",
        "Mindless fun requires a lighter touch and more suspense than director Renny Harlin can deliver.\n",
        "Yes, in its dumb, bludgeoning way, it's fun!\n",
        "The thrills are such a rush, however, and the balance of digitized and analog effects is generally so satisfying that pic's sheer dumbness finally becomes part of the fun.\n",
        "OK, I understand how gene therapy made the sharks smarter, but what made the scientists so stupid?\n",
        "An entertainingly trashy and derivative carnivore spectacular!\n",
        "Harlin delivers all the thrills, explosive action and sheer gore that audiences have come to expect!\n",
        "Deep Blue Sea is an example of how expert action filmmaking and up-to-the-minute visual effects can transcend a workmanlike script and bring excitement to conventional genre material.\n",
        "A neat package of terror, sharks and special effects!\n",
        "A gross, flagrant, in-broad-daylight violation of the Law of Billing.\n",
        "A taut, exciting thriller that takes movie-goers and characters deep under water and leaves them gasping for breath.\n",
        "Finally, a trashy summer movie that lives up to its billing!\n",
        "The characters have been designed to make fun of themselves, disguising the craft of writer Neil Cuthbert and director Kinka Usher in getting us to laugh at them.\n",
        "Usher's amiable spoof of superhero movies takes a brave stab at rewriting the mythology from the inside out, with lots of witty, mildly subversive stuff.\n",
        "Mystery Men is like its hapless heroes. It's a wannabe that has the best intentions -- including a pronounced anti-gun stance -- but none of the knack it takes to save the day, or itself.\n",
        "This bunch achieves peaks of sublime nuttiness.\n",
        "Surprisingly, this spoof's heart is genuinely warm.\n",
        "A long, shapeless, undisciplined mess!\n",
        "Formulaic but fun!\n",
        "A loud, frenetic, fitfully witty spoof of super-hero sagas.\n",
        "Mystery Men begins terrifically, then dwindles away to overextended ordinariness in its action sequences.\n",
        "Could use a little more brain, and a little less spleen.\n",

        "A snarky, wise-cracking spoof!\n",

        "Stretched far too thin for its meager plot, broad characters and lame running jokes.\n",
        "This droopy action comedy saps Hollywood's best comic actors of their superpowers.\n",

        "Charm and stardust carry it past its blatantly manufactured quality.\n",
        "There's no question the chemistry between them still works for a light romantic comedy. But an overcalculated, undernourished screenplay undermines much of the effort.\n",
        "Virtually every step the Runaway narrative takes produces collisions with credulity!\n",
        "It looks as if Julia and the horse were trying to get the hell away from the camera, and into a better movie.\n",
        "Marshall is too much of a softie; he meanders around the story, milking it for both sentiment and comedy and often tripping over himself in the process.\n",

        "At 27 Writer-Director Stanley Kubrick, in his third full-length picture, has shown more audacity with dialogue and camera than Hollywood has seen since the obstreperous Orson Welles went riding out of town on an exhibitors' poll.\n",
        "[The film] at first tends to be somewhat confusing, soon settles into a tense and suspenseful vein which carries through to an unexpected and ironic windup.\n",
        "Arguably Stanley Kubrick's most perfectly conceived and executed film.\n",
        "Characteristically Kubrick in both its mechanistic coldness and its vision of human endeavour undone by greed and deceit, this noir-ish heist movie is nevertheless far more satisfying than most of his later work.\n",
        "An engrossing little adventure.\n",
        "Kubrick's low-key lensing occasionally catches the flavor of the seamy side of Gotham life.\n",
        "A noirish thriller with experimental trimmings that holds back most of the emotions, sensitive as well as otherwise, that threatened to make Kubrick's first feature mawkish.\n",
        "Kubrick makes the most of flashback and dream sequences, and a surreal climactic fight in a warehouse full of mannequins.\n",
        "Kubrick worked in an uncharacteristically naturalistic style despite the genre material, with mixed but still fascinating results.\n",
        "This may be the most literate of all the spectacles set in antiquity.\n",
        "Asurprisingly apt companion piece to Paths of Glory in its consideration of the mechanisms of power.\n",
        "It is a spotty, uneven drama.\n",
        "The most courageous thing about it, from today's standards, is that it closes without an obligatory happy ending, and an audience that has watched for 187 minutes doesn't get a tidy, mindless conclusion.\n",
        "One of cinema's most heartfelt and sustained (it runs over three hours), if cynical, visions of an individual's powerlessness.\n",
        "Stanley Kubrick's magisterial Thackeray adaptation now stands as one of his greatest and most savagely ironic films, not to mention one of the few period pieces on celluloid so transporting that it seems to predate the invention of cameras.\n",
        "Ryan O'Neal's excellent performance captures the shallow opportunism endemic to the title character who is brought down as much by his own flaws as by the mores of the ordered social structure of 18th-century England.\n",
        "All of Stanley Kubrick's features look better now than when they were first released, but Barry Lyndon, which fared poorly at the box office in 1975, remains his most underrated. It may also be his greatest.\n",
        "Barry Lyndon isn't a great success, and it's not a great entertainment, but it's a great example of directorial vision: Kubrick saying he's going to make this material function as an illustration of the way he sees the world.\n",
        "The constant array of waxworks figures against lavish backdrops finally vulgarises the visual sumptuousness.\n",
        "The loveliest of Stanley Kubrick films. Indeed, Barry Lyndon is the one Kubrick movie that could even invite that adjective (or epithet).\n",
        "Another fascinating challenge from one of our most remarkable, independent-minded directors.\n",

        "A remarkable confluence of talents are at work here.\n",
        "Distinguished by its intensity of feeling and freewheeling use of the wide-screen frame, the film ranks among Truffaut's best.\n",
        "An engaging, moving film.\n",
        "Still one of the cinema's most perceptive forays into childhood.\n",
        "Amazingly, this vigorous effort is the first feature film of M. Truffaut, who had previously been (of all things!) the movie critic for a French magazine.\n",
        "For all of Truffaut's mastery of the behind-the-camera aspects of The 400 Blows, an equal share of the credit must go to lead actor Jean-Pierre Leaud.\n",
        "The later films have their own merits, and Stolen Kisses is one of Truffaut's best, but The 400 Blows, with all its simplicity and feeling, is in a class by itself.\n",
        "More than 40 years old, Francois Truffaut's whirling dervish remains an ageless beauty.\n",
        "With this 1961 film Truffaut comes closest to the spirit and sublimity of his mentor, Jean Renoir, and the result is a masterpiece of the New Wave.\n",
        "Truffaut's third film may not look the masterpiece it seemed 40-odd years ago, but it remains one of his most enjoyable movies.\n",
        "There is joy in the filmmaking that feels fresh today and felt audacious at the time.\n",
        "To put it quickly and crisply, it is charming, exciting and sad.\n",
        "Vibes is a harmless, painless romp but it's an instance of a sincere attempt at screwball comedy that simply got screwed up.\n",
        "Vibes is a low-vibration romantic comedy about two incompatible psychics falling in love on an Ecuadorean treasure hunt, and everything in it seems nine or 10 beats off.\n",
        "Luckily, Vibes has those quirky stars, a wacky threesome who give off good vibes under any circumstances.\n",
        "The romantic suspense soon takes a back seat to some singularly unimpressive special effects.\n",
        "Vibes has all the ingredients of lighthearted adventure-comedy except the essential one: laughs.\n",
        "The miscast and downright miserable company attempts zaniness against the exotic South American backdrop.\n",
        "Movies like Vibes appear and disappear like fireflies in the dog days of summer. Nobody seems to have made them, nobody sees them, nobody remembers them.\n",
        "This film -- insignificant and lightweight and monumentally silly -- is entertaining from beginning to end.\n",
        "A half-baked comedy without a heart.\n",
        "Writer-director Andrew Dominik takes his time with the story, but his languorous pacing allows tension to build -- and permits the actors, Affleck in particular, to add nuance and depth to characters who'll seem familiar only at first glance.\n",
        "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is the story...of the moment in America when myth was murdered by mere celebrity and we were left, perhaps forever, with only the latter's meager consolations.\n",
        "Moseying along for 160 minutes, this revisionist western by writer-director Andrew Dominik makes a wan attempt to present the Jesse James legend as the dawn of celebrity culture in America.\n",
        "Awesome splendor and a striking essay on celebrity reward those who brave the 2 1/2-hour run time.\n",
        "It's a view of the West beyond the myth that's worth enduring, if not relishing.\n",
        "Brad Pitt as Jesse James: Seldom has an actor been so perfectly cast.\n",
        "The one thing you're not supposed to do during a Western is doze off.\n",
        "Assassination is contemplative and quiet, a studied film that is surprisingly engrossing, not to mention so handsomely made you can hardly take your eyes off it.\n",
        "A better title might have been Jesse James in the Age of Pop Therapy.\n",
        "The movie has an almost hypnotic quality; its spare and often beautiful shots seem to sear themselves into the camera's lens.\n",
        "Who would have imagined that a biopic about Jesse James could be so boring?\n",
        "This is a 160-minute art Western, and if you're up for such a beast it is a glory to behold. It's gorgeous, but rarely for the sake of mere gorgeousness, and languorous, but never listless.\n",
        "Mostly ponderous, despite the unceasingly beautiful imagery.\n",
        "The movie has the space and freedom of classic Western epics.\n",
        "Everything about The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is longer than it needs to be. Its title, for one thing. Its duration -- two hours and 40 minutes! -- for another.\n",
        "As this old and twisted Jesse, Brad Pitt is quite good. But the movie really belongs to Casey Affleck as Robert Ford.\n",
        "The oddest major studio release of the year, and one of the most admirable.\n",
        "If you love classic and stylish mood Westerns such as McCabe and Mrs. Miller and The Long Riders, this is your film.\n",
        "It is excruciating: a combination of Beth Henley's insistently eccentric screenplay, Bruce Beresford's frenzied direction and the sight of three singular talents on an acting roller coaster with no one riding the brakes.\n",
        "Beresford fails to generate sufficient chemistry to bind the performances. Occasional bursts of delicious tragic humour nevertheless make this a not unlikeable 'feminist' mood piece.\n",
        "[It] has the dubious distinction of calling attention to just about everything the play isn't, and was never meant to be.\n",
        "As Spacek, Lange and Keaton clamor for attention, \"Crimes of the Heart\" becomes less a movie than a three-ring circus, and ringmaster Beresford does little to direct your gaze.\n",
        "There are moments when the movie doesn't seem to know where it's going, but for once that's a good thing because the uncertainty almost always ends with some kind of a delightful, weird surprise.\n",
        "The Oscar-winning actresses make fine confederates -- their gracious collaboration propelling this happy adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play.\n",
        "It is a great, warm, hard, unforgiving, triumphant movie, and there is not a scene that does not shine with the love of the people who made it.\n",
        "A passionate film noir that depends heavily upon Mr. Gere to give it credence, and Mr. Gere delivers.\n",
        "Count me among those who would be happy never to see another starring role for Gere, except maybe as Felix in a remake of The Odd Couple.\n",
        "A standard-issue cop thriller that amounts to Beverly Hills Cop in a bad mood.\n",
        "An above-average film noir, and its creepy feeling for the back streets of New Orleans and the sultry evil of its red-light suburbs got under my skin.\n",
        "Pearce pads out his plot with lots of borrowed bits ... but the borrowings don't have any resonance of their own: they simply hang on the story like empty thematic husks.\n",
        "The film makers haven't listened to Wright. They appear to have been aiming at the same genteel audience that insists on seeing something sentimental and upbeat even in a television movie-of-the-week about AIDS.\n",
        "Transforms the novel into an all-too-genteel crime story, denuded of rage, devoid of social and historic context.\n",
        "Unfortunately, drama translates as melodrama and speechy, preachy dialogue tells us we're watching something that's good for us.\n",
        "The movie understands that the story really is about the killer's point of view. It is not the story of a crime, not a docudrama, not a sociological essay.\n",
        "Although lacking the bite and depth of his best work, Radio Days is one of Woody Allen's most purely entertaining pictures.\n",
        "It's a great idea for a movie, but Allen fatally opts for a Fellini: Amarcord approach of formless narrative, larger-than-life coincidence, and rambling ruminations on what times there used to be.\n",
        "As free in form as it is generous of spirit.\n",
        "You peel and peel away at it only to find, in the end, nothing.\n",
        "\"Radio Days\" is so ambitious and so audacious that it almost defies description.\n",
        "Childhood anecdotes and charming vignettes are set against bright-light, big-city sets, a-dazzle with beautiful players.\n",
        "Midler and Long are never less than fun to watch.\n",
        "As a vehicle for their considerable comic talents, the enterprise is wheelclamped by typecasting.\n",
        "Every bit as rude and wonderful as Ruthless People...\n",
        "There's more regressive coyness in this buddy adventure-comedy than anyone should have to sit through in a lifetime...\n",
        "Such rarefied screen writing calls for the peerless talents of Arthur Hiller, a director with the comic timing of a tax auditor.\n",
        "Unfortunately, the movie is so busy cross-polinating its genres that it never pauses for the kind of thought that might have made it really special, instead of just fitfully funny.\n",
        "Dick leaves you hoping it finds the audience it clearly deserves.\n",
        "Fall-down funny laughs!\n",

        "Makes particular aspects of the recent American past comprehensible to those too young to have lived them.\n",
        "One of the cleverest comic premises of recent memory!\n",
        "Writer-director Andrew Fleming's new film has a way of transcending the obvious and establishing its own rules.\n",
        "It's a feeble comic spin, at best!\n",
        "A tasty/tacky treat!\n",
        "It's a swoony gem of an idea; too bad this Dick is so limp.\n",
        "This modest movie offers a convincing vision of Nixon White House operations as a sordid buffoon show undone by a couple of painfully earnest innocents.\n",
        "Audaciously imaginative, devilishly clever!\n",
        "The movie has the comic sophistication of a creaky high-school skit.\n",
        "A gaily funny, shrewdly inventive satire!\n",
        "A bright and sassy comedy!\n",
        "The setup is frequently clumsy and the delivery isn't any better.\n",
        "Dick is a gleefully cunning comedy!\n",
        "The Iron Giant is not only the best animated feature to be released this summer, it's the single best film to hit our screens so far this year.\n",
        "Brad Bird fills the CinemaScope screen with wit and beauty in this modern fairy tale.\n",
        "It is in the best tradition of animation: an ideal tale for children that offers a lot to adults as well.\n",
        "Lest all of this sound gravely symbolic, be assured that the film is, before anything else, deliciously funny and deeply affecting. And beautiful, oh so beautiful, as a work of coherent art.\n",
        "A smart live-and-let-live parable, full of glancing, acute observations on all kinds of big subjects...that you can talk about with the kids for a long time to come.\n",
        "This is enjoyable in part because of its flavorsome period ambience and its lively and satiric characters.\n",
        "A cool, unique-looking animated feature (the Ike-era design elements make for great eye candy), director Brad Bird's tale of a small-town boy and his outer-space robot is hip and entertaining without pandering, or condescending, to the kiddie set.\n",
        "As entertaining as it's intelligent.\n",
        "One of those rare films that will hold the attention of children in the 6 to 12 age range without insulting the intelligence of the adults who accompany them.\n",
        "The Iron Giant is a solid, not to say ironclad, winner in the less than overcrowded family animation arena.\n",
        "Remarkably unassuming, genuinely playful, and superbly executed, The Iron Giant towers over the cartoon landscape.\n",
        "Imagine E.T. as a towering metal man, and you have some of the appeal of The Iron Giant, an enchanting animated feature about a boy who makes friends with a robot from outer space.\n",
        "The Iron Giant is funny, warm, muscular and full of nuances that you can take home with you and talk about.\n",
        "The Iron Giant remembers the wonder of being a child and understands how to convey that in a media-savvy age.\n",
        "The Iron Giant marks a breakthrough in that neverland between computer and cel animation -- seamlessly blending a computer-generated character with the warmth of hand-drawn co-stars.\n",
        "A lovely and touching daydream.\n",
        "With its austere look and the absence of music, The Iron Giant is something new, arresting and quite wondrous in the way of animated movies.\n",
        "Warner Bros.' outstanding The Iron Giant is a giant leap for the studio and robotkind!\n",
        "Beautifully animated!\n",
        "Animated films excel in conjuring up colorful fantasy worlds, but few evoke an actual time and place as vividly -- and playfully -- as The Iron Giant does.\n",
        "So transparent is Osment as an actor, and so rare, that the pain on his face stabs you in the heart.\n",
        "Osment's pinched, old-young face suggests an ancient's insight without an ancient's defenses -- a sensitivity so exquisitely morbid that you worry more for his emotional than physical well-being.\n",
        "Willis turns in a measured and understated performance.\n",
        "A delicate, emotionally attentive, but very scary ghost story.\n",
        "I was not only surprised by the film's final twist, I wasn't even looking for one. I just thought I was watching a bad movie. The end doesn't quite redeem it, but it makes you think about what you've seen. That's a saving grace of some sort.\n",
        "Shyamalan's script is a clever construct, but also contains a great deal of sensitivity to the plight of the \"different\" child.\n",
        "M. Night Shyamalan neutralizes Willis's star presence with impressive plotting that's a fine excuse for the powerful atmosphere.\n",
        "An effectively understated and moodily engrossing ghost film with a surprisingly satisfying jolt at the end.\n",
        "A poignant study of the searing pain caused by loss, this all-too-human horror film provokes tears as well as fears.\n",
        "Billed as a 'chilling, psychological thriller,' this movie is actually none of those things.\n",
        "There's more fright in any 10 minutes of The Sixth Sense than the sensory startle effects The Haunting produces in its entire running time.\n",
        "Sixth Sense is scary -- and smart!\n",
        "An unusually intelligent thriller!\n",
        "A psychological thriller that actually thrills!\n",
        "Of the big studio films released this summer, it's hands-down the best!\n",
        "It's a quiet, slow movie that builds its scares gradually, leading to a wallop of a surprise ending.\n",
        "Interesting.\n",
        "It's a rarity for a movie to be willing to try your patience like The Sixth Sense does and even more of one for your perseverance to be so amply rewarded.\n",
        "The Sixth Sense is the kind of flawed movie that's worth sticking with.\n",
        "The Sixth Sense has a kind of calm, sneaky self-confidence that allows it to take us down a strange path.\n",
        "A guilty pleasure.\n",

        "Elaborate and inventive!\n",
        "It might be fun to see on an airplane or rent on video.\n",
        "Production has been lavished with extravagant sets and locations that welcome the audience into a fantasy world of untold luxury.\n",
        "Renee Russo is an absolute knockout!\n",
        "Thomas Crown Affair comes across as a pale shadow of the 1968 original.\n",
        "Crown is a guilt-free pleasure, a way to waste a couple of hours happily at the theater without encountering computer-generated monsters or teenagers losing their virginity.\n",
        "It's perplexing enough when Hollywood insists on remaking terrific movies. Why remake terrible ones? Perhaps to show that it can be done even worse.\n",
        "Clearly a labor of love, this sophomore effort from Turturro (a better actor than helmer), about fables and foibles of a tightly knit acting troup at turn of the century New York, is structurally messy and unevenly acted; a step fown from his debut Mac\n",
        "An involving love story between two emotionally damaged outsiders.\n",
        "The sheer neurotic intensity of Techine's characters -- characteristically stretching both backward and forward in time, as in a Faulkner novel--holds one throughout, as does Techine's masterful direction and many of the other performances.\n",
        "Alice and Martin is not to be missed, particularly in this endless lull of summer.\n",
        "For all the increasing sophistication of Techine's technique, the emotions he deals with are basic, and all the more powerful for it.\n",
        "Techine keeps a tight rein on his actors' dramatics.\n",
        "Alice et Martin has its faults, but there's some real meat here, in the performances and direction.\n",
        "Techine, typically honest and generous, always allows the churning emotional undercurrents to take over.\n",
        "Despite some glorious passages, Alice and Martin is play-act passion.\n",
        "A richly populated, observant film that suffers, forgivably, from an excess of curiosity about the world it depicts -- a surfeit of generosity, intelligence and art.\n",
        "When it comes to movies about dysfunctional family relationships and emotionally damaged individuals, few active filmmakers do a better job than veteran French director Andre Techine.\n",
        "Even a flawed Techine film merits our attention.\n",
        "Fans will have most of it memorized by now.\n",
        "All good stuff.\n",
        "A kind of insane logic seems to connect the sketches, if you look hard enough, but mostly the movie seems to exist in the present and be willing to try anything for a laugh.\n",
        "The computer animation of the monsters here is a herky-jerky cartoon blur that is anything but scary.\n",
        "National Lampoon's Vacation is an enjoyable trip through familiar comedy landscapes.\n",
        "Despite plenty of gross-out gags and dumb slapstick bits, the careful viewer can occasionally detect some acrid and original satire in this 1983 film.\n",
        "The result is not so much a comedy about American values as a 2,500 mile skid on a banana skin. The visual gags come thick and fast, and are about as subtly signposted as the exit markers on a freeway.\n",
        "The result is a confident humor and throwaway style that helps sustain the laughs -- of which there are quite a few.\n",

        "Delightfully entertaining, with a wryly amusing narration to keep the adults in the audience smirking.\n",
        "There are a number of small, unexpectedly funny moments in A Christmas Story, but you have to possess the stamina of a pearl diver to find them.\n",
        "There is a real knowledge of human nature beneath the comedy.\n",
        "Brings an enlivening wit to a comedy of culture collision!\n",
        "Uninspired, recycled!\n",
        "Mickey Blue Eyes has most of the ingredients in place for another one of those married-to-the-mob comedies, but the central character has to hold it together, and Hugh Grant is wrong for the role.\n",
        "Mickey is a limply derivative, disappointingly trivial and hokey fish-out-of-water crime comedy!\n",
        "In Mickey Blue Eyes, Grant is repeatedly mortified, humiliated, and otherwise pained, which means there is much for us to smile at.\n",
        "Has more than enough laughs to justify its silly, scatterbrained premise.\n",
        "It's tough to make a case denying that Mickey Blue Eyes is of passable entertainment value, but it's equally difficult to argue that it offers anything fresh or inspired.\n",
        "Atrocious!\n",
        "Preposterously convoluted plot twists!\n",
        "This is a movie that takes Hugh's charm as a granted and makes a good argument for its point of view.\n",
        "Grant is always a pleasure to watch, and Caan looks like he's having the time of his life!\n",
        "Reminds us of other films that used similar devices better.\n",
        "Grant's a delight!\n",
        "Slow-moving.\n",
        "Teaching Mrs. Tingle an ugly, failed attempt to pull off a Heathers - style, teen - oriented black comedy.\n",
        "Depressing!\n",
        "A wildly uneven and sloppily directed movie, full of clashing tones and undigested bits of superior films.\n",
        "As a routinely cruel, often vicious, miserably unhappy teacher, Mirren offers a complex, brilliantly disciplined performance!\n",
        "Newly benign, and noticeably clumsy.\n",
        "The movie needs a few more ideas and a lot more thrills to excite viewers, whether young or old.\n",
        "The lack of surprises, plot twists, and clever dialogue makes this a distressingly lame offering.\n",
        "Contains enough amusing moments and unpredictable twists for the film to score with teen audiences.\n",
        "A pat, hollow exercise!\n",
        "Spiteful and shallow!\n",
        "Wholly predictable and implausible plotting, thin characterizations, and stilted dialogue!\n",
        "There is nothing funny about the situation in Teaching Mrs. Tingle.\n",
        "Teaching Mrs. Tingle is funny, smart and full of unpredictable twists and turns.\n",
        "Teaching Mrs. Tingle reveals Williamson not only to be as accomplished a director as he is a writer but also his willingness to move beyond horror to psychological suspense.\n",
        "A screenful of nothingness!\n",
        "Even a fantasy, whoever it's for, has to have a plot that minimally makes sense, characters that make decisions based on coherent personalities, and a consistent tone. Unfortunately, Teaching Mrs. Tingle lacks all three.\n",
        "A dull assignment.\n",
        "If Universal Soldier: The Return isn't the dullest, most derivative, unimaginative, noisy, repetitive, mind-numbing and generally imbecilic movie of the year, it's not because director Mic Rodgers wasn't trying hard enough.\n",
        "It's actually the fourth entry in the series, after a couple of straight-to-cable sequels. That's a lot of pulp to squeeze out of a concept that was fairly juiceless to begin with.\n",
        "An underwhelming follow-up to one of the career-stalled action star's better efforts.\n",
        "This SF action sequel must have been slapped together fast: live-action stunts created by uninspired editing lead up to computer-generated imagery that's just as lame.\n",
        "Filling out and greying at the temples, Van Damme is far from convincing, even in the tedious fight sequences.\n",
        "Van Damme's acting skills remains undetectable.\n",
        "An endless barrage of action-packed fights sure to please all of Van Damme's diehard fans!\n",
        "Universal Soldier: The Return is a letdown!\n",
        "Its sequel is devoid of personality and has an annoying gratuitous sentimental streak.\n",
        "Despite all the pyrotechnics, I almost dozed off twice!\n",
        "The film fails, utterly, at virtually anything it attempts.\n",
        "The Return has the cramped, shoddy look of a straight-to-video knock-off.\n",
        "If the world is ever to be truly safe from Universal Soldiers, they, like Achilles, can suffer a mortal wound in only one place. For them, it's the box office!\n",
        "A screenwriter's desperate imagination!\n",
        "It's devoid of the full-fledged physical artistry of Jackie Chan or the mesmerizing carnage of the best Hong Kong action flicks.\n",
        "Universal Soldier is nothing for anyone to be proud of, on either side of the screen.\n",
        "The Muscles from Brussels mouths dialogue that wouldn't challenge a bivalve - and in an accent that makes Stallone sound like a master of elocution.\n",
        "This is one 'return' that's surely welcome!\n",
        "Judging from uniformly bottom-rung acting, the cast had some sort of pool going to see who could turn in the most ludicrously awful performance.\n",
        "Leaves behind almost as many derisive laughs as dead bodies.\n",
        "Mostly this is an amalgam of ideas, images and whole scenes lifted from other movies.\n",
        "Mr. Lundgren, who glowers his way all too convincingly through the role of a rabid bully, may well be the only man in the universe who can make Mr. Van Damme look like an actor.\n",
        "Though the idea is dumb enough to be fun, director Roland Emmerich does the Terminator thing without much style, and the two stars bash into each other but never connect.\n",
        "I suppose there is a market for this sort of thing among bubblebrained adolescents of all ages, but it takes a good chase scene indeed to rouse me from the lethargy induced by dozens and dozens of essentially similar sequences.\n",
        "The action and the campiness barrel along in entertaining counterpoint. You can laugh when you're not absorbed with truck chases.\n",
        "Perhaps Van Damme and Lundgren trade blows more easily than lines, but the whole affair is enjoyable in a mindless way.\n",
        "Love Stinks smells like a bad sitcom.\n",
        "A cut-rate romantic comedy of the kind that Adam Sandler would star in if his movies made no money.\n",
        "Love Stinks exceeds its expectations.\n",
        "They called it right: this movie reeks, stinks, smells and destroys life as we know it with one olfactory destructive blast.\n",
        "Love Stinks can make you feel good, especially if you've been involved in a bad relationship.\n",
        "The title is a misnomer. This movie has nothing to do with love; it's about lust, lucre and well-paid losers.\n",
        "Love Stinks is such a paean to television, it would have done better to go straight to video, where it belongs.\n",
        "Love Stinks offers up the very modest pleasures of a middling TV show, something you'd watch only if the cable went out on a Friday night.\n",
        "Sometimes it stinks with the sweat of failure. But sometimes it's as bitterly funny as its makers could hope.\n",
        "Holy mother of the bride, what bile was Jeff Franklin drinking when he came up with this curdled revenge fantasy?\n",
        "A cinematic exercise in overstatement.\n",
        "A one-dimensional comedy that mostly falls flat.\n",
        "Franklin has a certain talent for one-liners -- which Stewart delivers with rat-a-tat precision -- but the result is a spiteful movie that savors its own venom a little too well.\n",
        "Jeff Franklin's idea of cutting-edge comedy writing runs to the kind of vulgar, unfunny shtick that puts the gag in 'gag.'\n",
        "Just when you thought it was safe to go into the movie theater, along comes Love Stinks.\n",
        "In its exploration of the moral dilemma of the undercover life, In Too Deep breaks no ground. But Epps is a leading man on the rise, and Cool J is something to see.\n",
        "Competent yet largely forgettable.\n",
        "An extremely raw, disturbing film!\n",
        "The latest in a long line of mediocre August releases, this would-be thriller boasts several well acted, interesting characters stuck in a story that is unevenly paced and overly familiar.\n",
        "Sharp performances.\n",
        "Too Shallow!\n",
        "The characters are blur and not vivid.\n",
        "Plot not deep enough.\n",
        "It's the kind of summer movie you see only if a power failure has knocked out your air conditioning.\n",
        "Empty at the core but superficially diverting.\n",
        "The movie is a weakly scripted shambles.\n",
        "In Too Deep doesn't exactly abound in surprise plot twists. Even so, director Michael Rymer does a satisfying job of infusing the cliches with edgy persuasiveness.\n",
        "Slow and predictable!\n",
        "Aaron and Brown's script resounds throughout with astringent dialogue and stark authenticity.\n",
        "The script irrevocably falters.\n",
        "Rewardingly textured work.\n",
        "LL Cool J with his natural charisma is the key to the movie's edge.\n",
        "A gritty, well-acted urban drama with lots of humanity.\n",
        "Some solid acting; a great-looking film.\n",
        "Michael Crichton's story is underdeveloped and narrow in range, resulting in a tale more curious for its odd confluence of elements than for their edifying deployment.\n",
        "At its best, this achieves the beauty and grandeur of a Kurosawa epic -- at its worst, however, it feels like a Python remake of The Vikings.\n",
        "The film is fascinating to watch, but I can hardly say what it's about, other than people killing each other.\n",
        "A big cathartic blast.\n",
        "With a budget said to be more than $100 million, it displays a lot of cash on the screen, but little thought.\n",
        "It's little more than a shoddy string of action-movie cliches.\n",
        "The film feels as hollow as empty armor and slightly hackneyed.\n",
        "Loaded with potential, it's puzzlingly overblown and distant, as if its huge budget were an albatross around its neck.\n",
        "The 13th Warrior seems like a made-for-TV warrior movie without enough money to get really epic.\n",
        "With the possible exception of the action sequences and the very occasionally imaginative set design, it's awful.\n",
        "If the juiciest bouts of professional wrestling on television leave you feeling unfulfilled and pining for the primal howls of fight - to - the - death combat, The 13th Warrior just might be the answer to your prayers.\n",
        "Actually a well-marbled, albeit derivative, slab of action-movie man meat.\n",
        "The most unexpectedly audacious, exhilarating, and wildly creative adventure thriller I have seen in ages!\n",
        "It falls short where it counts: in the final confrontation.\n",
        "A mud-stained, blood-soaked and completely useless movie.\n",
        "The 13th Warrior is a kick in the 10th century.\n",
        "The 13th Warrior indulges in enough grubby histrionics and costume-adventure cliches to give you fifth-grade flashbacks.\n",
        "As movies about Norsemen go, it's not as witty as The Vikings with Kirk Douglas, but it holds your attention through sheer cinematic power.\n",
        "An exhilarating 100 minutes!\n",
        "Incomprehensible!\n",
        "All the Aramaic in the world can't save it from its own pounding slickness.\n",
        "A bloody mess!\n",
        "Stigmata is possibly the funniest movie ever made about Catholicism.\n",
        "A derivative, pretentious rock video with a half-cocked, quote-unquote religious melodrama.\n",
        "Ludicrous plot and even worse dialogue!\n",
        "What Stigmata suffers from is a bad case of late-1990s moviemaking. That is, it prefers sensationalism to making sense.\n",
        "Stigmata is an unusually intelligent and original thriller.\n",
        "Unless you are an admirer of splicing, production design and cinematography, there's not much point in seeing the film.\n",
        "How several good actors got talked into this movie is a mystery.\n",
        "At first seems to be about the Second Coming but turns out to be a half-baked anticlerical screed.\n",
        "Tom Lazarus and Rick Ramage should be ashamed to have written such nonsense!\n",
        "A leaden exercise in what can go wrong when movies attempt to explore mysterious forces with dated special effects and easy symbolism.\n",
        "The story makes increasingly little sense as it unspools!\n",
        "A shameless guilty pleasure!\n",
        "As with some of Fellini's late works, the energy and inventiveness, not to mention the juicy vulgarity, are so consistent in Black Cat, White Cat that you feel you can slice into the material at almost any point.\n",
        "A colorful, frenetic mixture of slapstick and folklore that stands a good chance of delighting arthouse audiences the world over.\n",
        "This is storytelling on the hoof, rambling, self-indulgent, but with enough warmth and humour to overcome its own excesses.\n",
        "Lacking the emotionally charged metaphors that made Underground something more than a virtuoso Saint Vitus dance, Black Cat, White Catis determined to twist every character into an ideogram for vulgar humanity.\n",
        "Bosnian-born writer-director Emir Kusturica makes raucous films so visually dense they overwhelm. But his characters, freakish or treacherous, come up wonderfully human.\n",
        "With all of the horrible things happening in the corner of the world once known as Yugoslavia, it's a pleasant change-of-pace to discover a comedy that transpires there.\n",
        "It's a mad scramble through the Felliniesque realm of Kusturica's imagination, and it proves nothing if not this much: give this man the Danube, Gypsy musicians and a camera, and you've got a party.\n",
        "There's nothing cynical or cold-hearted about Black Cat, White Cat. Like the waves of geese, pigs, goats, dogs and cats that sometimes threaten to overwhelm the human characters, it is recklessly, indescribably alive.\n",
        "Many scenes of confrontation play like heavy-handed, uncomfortably forced improv.\n",
        "It's a fairly good melodrama, nothing more.\n",
        "Jewison's lack of interest in developing anything other than his rather debatable ideological point relegates the film to the realm of moderately competent TV drama.\n",
        "Adam Curtis has become the most exciting documentary filmmaker of our time. He's at once a psychologist, a historian, a journalist, a wizard of images, and a fearlessly incisive cultural detective who delves beneath the hidden myths of the modern world.\n",
        "Though his bias is obvious, Curtis does his homework, getting the most damning evidence from interviews with the neocons themselves.\n",
        "A sprawling, intellectually ambitious documentary about the political phenomenon usually referred to in journalistic shorthand as the war on terror.\n",
        "Curtis' The Power of Nightmares finds that the basis of 21st century political power is fear. And for nearly three hours he makes it very hard to argue it's not.\n",
        "As partisan filmmaking it is often brilliant and sometimes hilarious.\n",
        "If the result seems less a coherent story than a two-hour pot high, Submarine is still a breakthrough combination of the feature film and art's intimacy with the unconscious.\n",
        "Here are all the ingredients of a novel entertainment.\n",
        "This 1968 Beatles musical gets somewhat plot heavy near the end, but it's a marvel of innocence and free association, blending several animation techniques in a loose narrative full of gentle bad puns and flowing visual segues.\n",
        "The animation is imaginatively conceived, but stiffly executed.\n",
        "There's such a wide disparity of graphic styles from sequence to sequence. Some of them, though, still look terrific.\n",
        "Yellow Submarine is a family movie in the truest sense.\n",
        "Almost 20 years after its release, this charming fable chronicling the Beatles' battles to save Pepperland from the Blue Meanies is one of the best testaments ever to the redeeming value of good music.\n",
        "A music-based animated film for the ages.\n",
        "The movie's boggling matter-of-factness is a key to its enduring -- no, its deepening -- charm.\n",
        "Alan Ball's script is a terrific piece of material, and Mendes responds directly to its subversive, provocative vision of a curdled American Dream.\n",
        "American Beauty approaches a manic, almost cartoonish edge without falling over. Both Spacey and Bening use extraordinary comic timing to bring these very sad, lost characters to life.\n",
        "[The filmmakers'] attacks on real-estate agents, corporate America and suburbia aren't so much shooting fish in a barrel as they are shooting fish in a shallow dish.\n",
        "Boldly challenging our sympathies, [Lester] somehow wins them because, to borrow a phrase, he's a man in full.\n",
        "The hairpin turns from farce to melodrama, from satire to bathos, are fresh and deftly navigated, but almost every one of the underlying attitudes is smug and easy.\n",
        "This amazing and impassioned fantasia about American loneliness begins as satire and ends with a vision of the sublime.\n",
        "As the latest mainstream movie symptom of our premillennial malaise, American Beauty is so brilliantly acted, written, directed and visualized that for all its despondency and despair, it is a lot of fun.\n",
        "Director Mendes guides an artful path between desire and self-disgust, playing youth against experience, male against female.\n",
        "An astonishingly assured first feature from transatlantic theater whiz kid Sam Mendes.\n",
        "A great, tremendously entertaining experience. I only wish there were more films this satisfying.\n",
        "This is definitely a knife-to-the-heart movie -- the kind whose potent effect is easy to feel yet hard to describe.\n",
        "The kind of artful defiance that Hollywood is usually too timid to deliver: a jolting comedy that makes you laugh till it hurts.\n",
        "At this point in the year, I'd readily call American Beauty one of the best movies of 1999. It is certainly the best-acted, with Kevin Spacey a standout among a stellar ensemble cast.\n",
        "American Beauty is a comedy because we laugh at the absurdity of the hero's problems. And a tragedy because we can identify with his failure.\n",
        "An acerbic, darkly comic critique of how social conventions can lead people into false, sterile and emotionally stunted lives, American Beauty is a real American original.\n",
        "A millennial classic.\n",
        "It does have a welcome freshness.\n",
        "There's too much dead air around the dialogue and the comic pacing is nonexistent.\n",
        "Moviemakers who feel betrayed by the cheery sitcoms of their adolescence can now take it out on all the rest of us and, as a bonus, get points for profundity too.\n",
        "It's a picture with a great cool shiny surface, and it boasts superb actors, witty and iconoclastic writing, vigorous and imaginative direction and brilliantly stylized cinematography.\n",
        "A perfect game in Yankee Stadium is no big deal these days; two have been pitched in the past 16 months. But a good baseball movie, that's hard.\n",
        "For the first 100 minutes or so I found this hokey but serviceable; after that my watch became more meaningful than anything I could locate on-screen.\n",
        "Thinking back through the movie, I cannot recall a single thing either character said that was worth hearing in its own right, apart from the requirements of the plot.\n",
        "Costner is as uneven as the storytelling itself, stone cold at moments, shimmeringly real in others.\n",
        "[The] game stretches over most of the film, but any anticipated suspense is undercut by the sepia-tinted inserts charting the couple's bumpy uninvolving five-year romance from first meeting to acrimonious split(s)\n",
        "At two hours-plus, it doesn't just seem long, it sometimes feels like a double rain delay.\n",
        "Those who have even a small soft spot for baseball's soothing rhythms will be hard-pressed to resist it.\n",
        "For Love of the Gameis designed to put a baseball-sized lump in your throat. Well before that, however, you may feel like putting a lump on Kevin Costner's head.\n",
        "The director especially deserves credit for the verisimilitude of the baseball sequences.\n",
        "It is a romance about a man and a woman, and it is a romance about baseball itself.\n",
        "OK, Sam, maybe you believed you had to sell your soul to Hollywood. But did you have to sell it this cheap?\n",
        "The film comes across like the un-Bull Durham: Every woozy cliche that Shelton and Costner refrained from has been given pride of place here.\n",
        "Filmmaking, like baseball, is a team game, and sometimes even a talented lineup produces unexceptional results.\n",
        "Depressingly, for a plot propelled by a love story, For Love of the Game sure strikes out when it comes to Billy and Jane's romance.\n",
        "Such established names as John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole will have to be seen to be believed.\n",
        "Caligula is sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash. If it is not the worst film I have ever seen, that makes it all the more shameful: People with talent allowed themselves to participate in this travesty.\n",
        "All in all it's a dreary shambles.\n",
        "For sheer camp RBI, this Tinto Brass-Bob Guccione freak is the World Series played, won, and paraded.\n",
        "At best, it is fun. But \"fun\" is not an aesthetic experience: fun remains on the surface. I have nothing against the surface. But it belongs where it is and shouldn't be taken for anything else.\n",
        "American-born director Richard Lester serves up a helping of what, on this side of the pond, we came to think of as kicky, mod British filmmaking.\n",
        "The mop-tops are likeably relaxed, with Lennon offering a few welcome moments of his dry, acerbic wit.\n",
        "It's a fine conglomeration of madcap clowning in the old Marx Brothers' style, and it is done with such a dazzling use of camera that it tickles the intellect and electrifies the nerves.\n",
        "Not only has this film not dated, it may even look fresher than it did in 1964; the zigzag cutting and camera moves, the jaunty ironies and pop-celebrity playfulness, are all standard issue now on MTV and its offspring.\n",
        "To watch the final concert segment is to look back decades and realize, as you do seeing vintage footage of Duke Ellington or Frank Sinatra or John Coltrane, that it's never really gotten any better.\n",
        "The music video by which all other music videos must be judged. And none top it.\n",
        "Still feels brand spanking new, and way cool.\n",
        "Younger fans can see what Beatlemania was really all about.\n",
        "Has survived the years like a Disney cartoon classic.\n",
        "It captures almost everything good about its time.\n",
        "We loved them -- yeah, yeah, yeah. Now we can love them all over again.\n",
        "To watch the movie, and to enjoy such pop music classics as 'All My Loving' and 'She Loves You' is not merely to saunter down Memory or Penny Lane, but to drink at pop's headwaters.\n",
        "Richard Lester's tangential, effortlessly clever ode to the Fab Four, given the re-mastered print and soundtrack treatment, still feels fresh and alive.\n",
        "No movie of the 1960s catches that era's irreverent joy and exuberance as much as director Richard Lester's Beatlemania saga.\n",
        "One of the great life-affirming landmarks of the movies.\n",
        "In A Hard Day's Night, the Beatles, in song after song, pay homage to the faith of love, and that faith connects them to something ancient, lending this topspin musical its near oracular beauty.\n",
        "No previous rocksploitation film had ever done so splendid a job of selling its performers.\n",
        "A Hard Day's Night conveys not just a joy in music and The Beatles, but a joy in cinema.\n",
        "The film is mad, mad and crazy, shrewdly designed for the teenage and calculated also to attract the curious and the oldsters who enjoy this sort of thing.\n",
        "I can't imagine how the filmmakers went about it, let alone pulled the whole thing off, but their film comes together in unpredictable and remarkably pleasurable ways.\n",
        "A glorious rebuke to all this summer's recycled, effects-ridden, laboriously \"fun\" Hollywood disappointments piled along the wayside like so many crashed cars.\n",
        "We're constantly kept on our toes regarding issues of representation while Pekar's sour but indefatigible working-class skepticism carries us along.\n",
        "Hugely enjoyable and very clever portrait of Harvey Pekar.\n",
        "It would be a mistake to regard American Splendor as an anthem for the common man. It is the uncommon that is being celebrated here.\n",
        "If Harvey Pekar is a brilliant oddity so is the movie that tells his story.\n",
        "Reminds you that sometimes, simply getting out of bed each morning can be the most heroic of acts.\n",
        "The kind of movie that sticks with you for days, your admiration growing each time you remember it.\n",
        "An audacious mix of documentary, animation, comic and staged film that somehow finds heart and hope in the gray wash of a real life.\n",
        "Codirectors Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, who have three traditional documentaries on their resume, do a good job of keeping the various Harveys and Joyces from bumping into each other.\n",
        "Wildly original and entertaining.\n",
        "As touching as it is achingly, hilariously prickly.\n",
        "It's an experience that's deeply human and profoundly moving.\n",
        "Funny, poignant and vitally original.\n",
        "The real magic of American Splendor lies in the sprightly transitions, the way it takes you from one level of reality and representation to the next without missing a beat.\n",
        "The most amazing, colossal and fantastic comic-inspired movie in years.\n",
        "Thrillingly inventive, charming when it needs to be, prickly when it has to be and, like a potter's wheel, constantly in motion as it shapes celluloid into visual art.\n",
        "It's a humane and witty treatment of an average life that, incidentally, speaks to the worth and inherent drama of average lives.\n",
        "That rarity: a true original.\n",
        "It's a beauty: wise, many-layered, and funny as hell.\n",
        "The facts in this pop biography are often hopelessly askew, but the story is carried by the unadulterated power of Gary Busey's original and insightful performance.\n",
        "Fright Night dances on a tightwire between satire and terror, glittered by special effects and a with-it nonchalance.\n",
        "Chris Sarandon is terrific as the vampire, quite affable and debonair until his fingernails start to grow and his eyes get that glow.\n",
        "It shouldn't even begin to work, and yet, strangely, it does, sort of, thanks to the assured handling of writer/director Holland.\n",
        "Its tone is never exactly comedic and its horrific touches are more disgusting than scary.\n",
        "Fright Night is not a distinguished movie, but it has a lot of fun being undistinguished.\n",
        "Nothing special, but it's a decent example of a vanished genre - the small character comedy.\n",
        "Each of the four lead performances is exceptional, none more so than Burt Reynolds' beefy, supercilious Lewis.\n",
        "John Boorman's 1972 film of the James Dickey novel has a beautiful visual style that balances the film's machismo message.\n",
        "It's the stuff of which slapdash oaters and crime programmers are made but the obvious ambitions of Deliverance are supposed to be on a higher plane.\n",
        "It's a haunting, nightmarish vision.\n",
        "A fantasy about violence, not a realistic consideration of it.\n",
        "So many of Dickey's lumpy narrative ideas remain in his screenplay that John Boorman's screen version becomes a lot less interesting than it has any right to be.\n",
        "Give Boorman credit for the loopy grandeur of his imagery and imaginings, for the sweet smell of excess, for his heroic gamble that a movie can dare to trip over its pretensions -- and still fly.\n",
        "There is humor here (in the form of a vaudeville Merlin, played by Nicol Williamson) as well as a diminution of scale that seems intended to help audiences through the thornier byways of Boorman's vision.\n",
        "Exquisite, a near-perfect blend of action, romance, fantasy and philosophy, finely acted and beautifully filmed by director John Boorman and cinematographer Alex Thomson.\n",
        "For all its audacity, a misguided folly.\n",
        "What a wondrous vision Excalibur is! And what a mess.\n",
        "Mr. Boorman takes these myths very seriously, but he has used them with a pretentiousness that obscures his vision.\n",
        "This wanbabe noir is frustrating due to the meandering nature of the pretentious, riddle-like script and lethargic, incompetent direction of Paul Auster in his solo directorial debut\n",
        "One thing is sure: there has never been a movie musical quite like Tommy, a weird, crazy, wonderfully excessive version of The Who's rock opera.\n",
        "This 1975 film's inventiveness begins to flag about halfway through, but by then it's a relief. If only Wagner could have lived to see this.\n",
        "Ken Russell's filmization of Tommy is spectacular in nearly every way.\n",
        "This is both the movie in which [Russell] is most faithful to the ideas and tone of his material, and one of his very worst films.\n",
        "It's all fairly excessive and far from subtle, but in this case good taste would have been wildly inappropriate and a fearful drag.\n",
        "The effect is exhilarating and exhausting.\n",
        "There's a by-the-numbers feel to much of the action.\n",
        "Terrific, fun.\n",
        "Neither the best nor the worst, Operation Condor makes for a slap-happy medium\n",
        "The point of the movie is the fight scenes, and they're impressive, as is the car chase, one of the funniest, most inventive in recent memory.\n",
        "Another exhilarating, jaw-dropping romp.\n",
        "Flawed or not, it would be churlish not to appreciate Operation Condor's Keatonesque plasticity.\n",
        "There's a kind of innocence to it all, and a joy of performance.\n",
        "It's far from his best work, and holds together about as well as a Clinton cabinet, but it's still thoroughly entertaining.\n",
        "A laughably dubbed, awkwardly plotted variation on Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n",
        "Fortunately, Chan is so enjoyable that, even though the plots and characters vary from recycled to irrelevant, mediocre films like Operation Condor still feature bursts of undeniable entertainment.\n",
        "Perhaps more than any other Chan movie, this one suggests that he's most at home being a clown.\n",
        "This movie should be exhumed and executed again!\n",
        "This movie was made primarily in the hopes that it would gross millions and millions of dollars, which probably explains most of the things that are wrong with it.\n",
        "Visual lushness is almost the only indication that the movie was directed by the same Bruce Beresford who made Breaker Morant and Driving Miss Daisy.\n",
        "Beresford's straight-ahead approach to the material, as a heart-tugger, is 180 degrees wrong.\n",
        "A generally dumb movie with a smart, appealing, gutsy leading lady.\n",
        "It has no subtlety, no shadings, and no suspense, and might as well not have a screenplay.\n",
        "A muddled thriller.\n",
        "A lukewarm outing that mostly just bops from plot point to plot point.\n",
        "Ms. Judd looks too dainty to throw herself into anything more reckless than a manicure.\n",
        "The picture itself is so nonsensical you don't understand why anyone would actually make it.\n",
        "A fast-moving, entertaining bit of silliness that's wrapped around a semi-interesting premise -- and a taut performance by Judd.\n",
        "Piles one loony twist on another with dizzying abandon when it's not bogged down drinking up scenery that has been exploited to a fare-thee-well on the big screen.\n",
        "The result has a drawback common to such movies: too much screen time devoted to the conceit when anyone who has seen the coming-attractions trailer knows it already.\n",
        "Robin Williams in his best film since Good Will Hunting!\n",
        "I never lost awareness that I was watching actors speaking lines, not real people.\n",
        "The film leans from the comedic to the near-mawkish.\n",
        "A markedly better picture than Roberto Benigni's far more sentimental Oscar collector.\n",
        "Jakob the Liar deserves a place alongside Life Is Beautiful and, yes, even Schindler's List.\n",
        "Jakob the Liar wants the freedom of the Benigni film but doesn't want to pay the dues.\n",
        "Peter Kassovitz establishes an effectively grim, cramped yet barren setting, making respectful use of locations in Poland and Budapest.\n",
        "Williams is seriously miscast, and his presence in the movie damages its credibility and effectiveness.\n",
        "Jakob the Liar can't embrace the tragedy of the Holocaust.\n",
        "Williams' performance is a masterpiece of mixed emotions.\n",
        "A plodding, well-intended comedy-drama drowned in a muddy palette of grays and browns, thick with the odd sound of American actors using fake Polish accents.\n",
        "The film anticipates all laughter and emotion in ways that make it its own worst enemy.\n",
        "Seems forced, calculating, self-conscious.\n",
        "Jakob the Liar is a trial of cliche, strained optimism, and dire quasi-comedy.\n",
        "Jakob the Liar is so forced that only the interest of a star of Williams' magnitude could have gotten it made.\n",
        "Sluggish!\n",
        "Written with astonishing crudeness!\n",
        "Imperfect.\n",
        "Mumford is a movie full of insightful moments, and some of them are even pure therapy.\n",
        "A likable semi-screwball comedy.\n",
        "Neither funny, heart-warming nor star-powered enough to motivate the public to turn out in very large numbers.\n",
        "Writer-director Kasdan has a nice way with his oddball crew.\n",
        "Mumford is so carefully visualized in Lawrence Kasdan's new film that you'd sort of like to live there.\n",
        "Kasdan's new comedy, Mumford, is so wonderfully odd, even spiritual, that audiences won't be able to do anything but smile.\n",
        "The film is quite well acted, notably by Dean.\n",
        "Hope Davis deserves much of credit for making Mumford work.\n",
        "It turns the tricks of psychology into duplicitous high play.\n",
        "It's witty, entertaining, often funny as hell and even, at times, surprisingly wise about the human condition.\n",
        "There is a curious absence of development in this film.\n",
        "Director Lawrence Kasdan's Mumford blends likable characters with a humorous, gentle look at small town life.\n",
        "This eccentric fairy tale with the feel of Our Town has a number of remarkable performances, chiefly those of Loren Dean.\n",
        "The performances are disarming and Mumford is the kind of comedy that grows on you if you give it a chance.\n",
        "The film is nothing if not benign, but its merits are moot for those above 7 or so.\n",
        "How does it end? With a headache, of course, from all those cheering children.\n",
        "If you have an Elmo fan in your life, Elmo In Grouchland is a must.\n",
        "Silly, sweet movie.\n",
        "An appeal that tops out at about age 4.\n",
        "Teens and young adults who have loved Sesame Street since childhood may just find themselves drawn to The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland.\n",
        "The Henson magic is at work.\n",
        "Older kids weaned on Sesame Street might get a kick of nostalgia at the sight of Big Bird, Maria, the Count and all.\n",
        "The direction of Gary Halvorson and screenplay by Mitchell Kriegman and Joseph Mazzarino keep Elmo's adventures sparkling.\n",
        "Preschoolers will be tickled by The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland.\n",
        "The Jim Henson folks, who earlier this year gave us Muppets from Space, come up with another winner.\n",
        "It's difficult for even the cynic in the audience to resist giggling at the sight of a grown man and a tiny-voiced Muppet arguing whether or not the Blanket an entire film has been built around should be called \"Wubby\" instead.\n",
        "The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland won't tickle anyone much above the age of 6.\n",
        "Full of that wonderful junky, clunky, huggable smartness that has made Sesame Street an enduring phenomenon.\n",
        "This cockamamy action flick is excruciatingly formulaic -- brimming with spy movie cliches but devoid of the genre's fun, upper-class pretensions.\n",
        "A frenetically junky action adventure that will quickly dribble off to vid stores after a token fast break in theatrical release.\n",
        "Neither the Rivera scenery nor the martial arts of Xiong Xin Xin, much less the automotive stunts attributable to Remy Julienne, can lift Simon Sez beyond the very ordinary.\n",
        "Movies and Rodman would seem to be made for each other, but the pictures will have to start getting better than this one.\n",
        "A damning yet idealistic satire about the motives behind U.S. foreign policy.\n",
        "The last reel descends into a muddle of trade-offs, heroic about-turns and romanticised rebels, but this is defiant, provocative cinema; Russell may yet prove a film-maker to treasure.\n",
        "No, Three Kings is not a great picture, but it is a very good one, perhaps the first feature of merit to come out of the Gulf War.\n",
        "Three Kings manages to venture into places that most American films never go.\n",
        "Possibly the best wartime comedy since Robert Altman's M*A*S*H.\n",
        "An original and brilliant combination of comedy, action and sophisticated political comment.\n",
        "An intelligent film for an excess of visual imagination.\n",
        "Three Kings is one of the most exciting Hollywood action films in years, and the best Vietnam movie since Apocalypse Now.\n",
        "David O. Russell's nervy attempt to reinvent the war movie and a further step in the evolution of an audacious and entertaining filmmaker.\n",
        "Three Kings is a resourceful and even witty film that irreverently reinvents the war movie.\n",
        "Interesting and occasionally exhilarating.\n",
        "Artsy style overpowers message in Three Kings.\n",
        "Three Kings takes a comfortable proletarian view of Desert Storm.\n",
        "Ultimately, instead of drawing us in, his swagger and the dazzle of his pyrotechnics keep us at a remove from the savagery. They become abstractions, too.\n",
        "It has the freedom and recklessness of Oliver Stone or Robert Altman in their mad-dog days, and a visual style that hungers for impact.\n",
        "Though Russell is most impressive for his writing and his immensely witty direction of actors, Three Kings begins by placing its emphasis firmly elsewhere.\n",
        "The first Hollywood feature to take on the 1991 Gulf War, Three Kings does so in an impudently comic, stylistically aggressive and, finally, very thoughtful manner.\n",
        "A sardonic, rock-'em, sock-'em Gulf War flick.\n",
        "Three Kings is a dark, zesty, live-wire action-adventure comedy.\n",
        "Vigor, intelligence and eyes kept open makes Three Kings a top-of-the-line war-action movie.\n",
        "Steve Zahn shines in Illsley's feature debut, elevating this eccentric small-town comedy two notches above the level of writing. Using the fish out of water format, this Sundance premiere begins well but then declines rapidly.\n",
        "A charming fish-out-of-water romantic comedy, the modestly budgeted Happy, Texas more than makes up in heart what it lacks in splash.\n",
        "Happy, Texas is a hoot, a hilarious comedy that's smart and caring, yet sexy and ingenious enough that it just might stir up some of that elusive Full Monty-style box-office appeal.\n",
        "This is one of those comedies that doesn't pound us on the head with the obvious, but simply lets us share vast amusement.\n",
        "...a wellspring of sweet, effervescent humor that reminds us that comedies don't have to be all about fart jokes and bathroom humor.\n",
        "Northam provides low-key comic counterpoint to Zahn's hilariously manic turn. Macy's deadpan, earnest sheriff is the one to watch, though.\n",
        "Anybody with a soft spot for fakers, who either identifies with them or just admires their chutzpah, is going to get a kick out of Happy, Texas.\n",
        "Almost everybody in this not-so-funny comedy is giddy and cuddlesome with a gosh-oh-gee enthusiasm that is at first engaging but quickly becomes a sign of a desperation to be liked.\n",
        "...if the world is not exactly aching from a lack of fish-out-of-water criminal capers, Happy, Texas nevertheless pleasingly proves that even a shtick we've seen before can charm when it's done well.\n",
        "A befuddled story about a man constrained from the neck down told by a director confused from the neck up.\n",
        "One of George Romero's most effective and interesting horror thrillers.\n",
        "Romero's is a formidable talent which others can only hope to ape.\n",
        "A film that begins in sentimentality and ends in ludicrous melodrama.\n",
        "Somewhere within this movie's two hours or so is hidden an absolutely spellbinding 90-minute thriller.\n",
        "There was a time when Romero would have used these elements for pure shock effect, but the horrors in Monkey Shines are more internalized, which make them all the more scary.\n",
        "Strong point of the feature is that it's played for both horror and laughs.\n",
        "A spotty little horror movie, effective here and there through some appealing eccentricities.\n",
        "Although enough of a cult favourite to spawn a trio of undistinguished sequels, this low budget independent horror movie is a surprisingly shambolic affair whose moments of genuine invention stand out amid the prevailing incompetence.\n",
        "It's thoroughly silly and endearing.\n",
        "This is fun but, compared with Kurosawa's other 60s efforts, relatively slight.\n",
        "The charm of this fascinating Toho production, stylishly directed by Akira Kurosawa, is the personality of the hero, powerfully played by Toshiro Mifune.\n",
        "Kurosawa was pressured by his producers into directing this sequel to Yojimbo, and rose to the occasion by making his funniest and least overtly didactic film\n",
        "A surprising, fetching, beautifully made film that fitly propounds the lesson of his own professionalism: 'Never send a boy to do a man's work.'\n",
        "This might have been tailor-made by director Pollack to ease Ford into more straightforwardly romantic territory.\n",
        "Looks more like a case of random minds.\n",
        "Enormously boring.\n",
        "A meandering mystery - drama - romance that never hits the right groove."

        "The heat generated by these two attractive stars barely rises above room temperature.\n",
        "Beyond all its pointless circling around the center, Random Hearts tests audience patience by showing behavior far too long before explaining it.\n",
        "The film's underlying concept is so irredeemably screwy and far-fetched that no amount of fine work can hope to make it convincing.\n",
        "Pollack appears to have taken lessons from Martin Brest about how to irritate and bore viewers with endless pauses in conversations.\n",
        "The tough, laconic Ford is wrenchingly effective throughout most of Random Hearts, and the story in which he figures is a strong one.\n",
        "I'd rather see the thriller in the trailer, about a plane crash, infidelity and scandal.\n",
        "Random Hearts is the cinematic equivalent of enduring a cross-country airplane flight trapped in a seat next to a manic depressive.\n",
        "Pollack lingers over the details of the plane crash, and the dialogue is a series of morose retro howlers.\n",
        "Not written well enough.\n",
        "A pleasant surprise.\n",
        "Contrasting the erotic with the disgusting is usually provocative and can be funny, but not in this underdog comedy.\n",

        "Silly but compellingly sweet movie.\n",
        "Sluggish and predictable.\n",
        "A comedy with several good laughs but no convincing cohesion.\n",

        "The film is framed, too unquestioningly, as a transgender Rebel Without a Cause, with Brandon the martyred innocent who dies for her infatuations.\n",
        "Stunning.\n",
        "With its constant juxtaposition of blazing nighttime highwayscapes and the flat Nebraska skyline, Boys Don't Cry manages to perfectly evoke both a life spent in aimless forward motion and the stifling boredom Brandon was so desperate to escape.\n",
        "A stirring, emotionally true testament to foolish bravery as well as shameful evidence of the severity with which it is so often punished.\n",
        "Swank is impressive in the lead role.\n",

        "A haunting, superbly made film.\n",
        "Boys Don't Cry not only revisits the crime, but convinces us we're being taken inside it.\n",
        "The crimer suffers from a slim, underdeveloped script by Lem Dobbs (who also write Kafka), but benefits from Soderbergh's astute direction that posits two 1960s cinematic icons, Brit Terrence Stamp and American Peter Fonda as long-time enemies.\n",
        "Those interested in more challenging work will find the film a unique meditation on the nature of Hollywood.\n",
        "An apparently simple movie that demands and rewards a deeper look.\n",

        "The movie has lots of drive, and it keeps Stamp front and center almost continuously, even in flashbacks.\n",
        "Stamp's fans from way back in Billy Budd days, as well as Priscilla's more recent converts, will savor every second of The Limey.\n",
        "Exciting!\n",
        "Much of the entertainment comes from the film's autumnal mood, and watching Fonda and Stamp work their characters.\n",
        "Like Pablo Picasso thrillingly exploding old notions of how we perceive faces and wine bottles, director Steven Soderbergh thrillingly splinters time and action in The Limey.\n",
        "It's clever, cool fun and it looks great.\n",
        "Soderbergh's direction of the film takes the underlying story, which is basic Ross Macdonald, and uses the visuals to add an ironic amusement.\n",
        "Intoxicatingly well-crafted!\n",
        "Sleek, stylish.\n",
        "Soderbergh might just be the best director of conversations in Hollywood.\n",
        "Among Soderbergh's widely varied films, this one actually has the best chance of becoming anyone's sentimental favorite.\n",
        "The Limey is one of the best films seen in many years about the mysterious workings of time and memory.\n",
        "For writer/director Paul Brickman, this was a case of being in the right place at the right time and, perhaps most importantly, getting the right leading man in place.\n",
        "This film is deftly made, the humor nicely understated, the leading actors (Tom Cruise and Rebecca de Mornay) smart and appealing.\n",
        "One of the finest film explorations of the end of innocence.\n",
        "Writer-director Paul Brickman can therefore be accused of trying to have it both ways, but there's no denying the stylishness and talent of his direction.\n",
        "What distinguishes it, however, is that it's hovering permanently on the brink of stark, staring disaster in a way that strangely recalls The Graduate.\n",
        "It's funny because it deals with subjects that are so touchy, so fraught with emotional pain, that unless we laugh there's hardly any way we can deal with them -- especially if we are now, or ever were, a teenage boy.\n",
        "[The film] improves as it goes along.\n",
        "It's not a masterpiece, but it is a fast-moving thriller, one worth revisiting (and, evidently, remaking).\n",
        "Total Recall is too much -- but it's too much of a good thing.\n",
        "The fierce and unrelenting pace, accompanied by a tongue-in-cheek strain of humor in the roughhouse screenplay, keeps the film moving like a juggernaut.\n",
        "A worthy entry in the dystopian cycle launched by Blade Runner, this seems less derivative than most of its predecessors yet equally accomplished in its straight-ahead storytelling, with plenty of provocative satiric undertones and scenic details.\n",
        "The future doesn't come any better.\n",
        "Melding the ever-more-workable Schwarzenegger mystique with a better-than-average science-fiction premise, the director Paul Verhoeven has come up with a vigorous, superviolent interplanetary thriller that packs in wallops with metronomic regularity.\n",
        "A gratuitous explosion of vainglory and guts, the movie is all firecrackers and giblets and broken glass. The overall effect is like wading through hospital waste.\n",
        "Recall is full of the musclebound action that [Schwarzenegger's] fans presumably enjoy. It also means that this Mars-bound movie is violent, nasty and expensive (it cost Tri-Star well over $60 million).\n",
        "There may be people who overlook the Arnold Schwarzenegger performance in Total Recall who think he isn't really acting. But the performance is one of the reasons the movie works so well.\n",
        "Neither Arnold Schwarzenegger nor Paul Verhoeven have stretched their talents here.\n",
        "Lawrence Kasdan's 1981 noir fable is highly derivative in its overall conception, but it finds some freshness in its details.\n",
        "Though Lawrence Kasdan's film is set in today's South Florida, its characters move through an atmosphere that suggests the confluences of decor and demeanor in a 1940s film noir.\n",
        "There's no denying the narrative confidence that brings the film to its unfashionably certain double-whammy conclusion.\n",
        "While Body Heat involves murder, fraud, a weak hero led astray and a seductive, double-dealing broad, it also incorporates something new: a sexual explicitness that the old films could only hint at.\n",
        "Body Heat is good enough to make film noir play like we hadn't seen it before.\n",
        "What should've been a joyful romp turns into a stale, sour-edged celebration of the New Conformist, an affluent, technology-addled cherub without a rebellious whim in his brain.\n",
        "It is most curious that Hughes, who is obviously clever and talented, has failed to develop the intriguing situation he has set in motion.\n",
        "[While Risky Business] suggested that money isn't everything, Ferris Bueller insists just the opposite.\n",
        "A film that doesn't seem to know what it's about until the end.\n",
        "Here is a dream as old as adolescence, and it is fun to be reminded of its ageless potency, especially in a movie as good-hearted as this one.\n",
        "Ferris Bueller exhibits John Hughes on an off day. Paucity of invention here lays bare the total absence of plot or involving situations.\n",
        "The overriding impression is one of utter nihilism, of a world divided into bored, crassly materialistic teenagers and doltish, unfeeling adults.\n",
        "Ferris is an admittedly entertaining, at times delightful fellow. How unfortunate that no one got to wring the little bastard's neck.\n",
        "In this film [Hughes] has created a character who is every teen-ager's fantasy, but in the process he has lost some of the authenticity of his other films.\n",
        "The film's heart is in the right place, and Ferris Bueller is slight, whimsical and sweet.\n",
        "A curiously languid affair, rather than the breathless Costa-Gavras-style thriller which was the least one might have expected from this kind of material.\n",
        "A good, romantic melodrama that suffers more than most good, romantic melodramas in not being much better than it is.\n",
        "To luxuriate in the film's 3-hour, 10-minute length is to experience this masterpiece as it hasn't been experienced since the day it opened.\n",
        "Shot in 1943 during World War II, Children of Paradise overcame so many seemingly impossible obstacles that today the film seems enchanted.\n",
        "If you give this movie time to work on you, the elements that seem overly artificial or impossibly distant from our own time fade into insignificance, and you're left with a complicated and wonderful romantic drama that's full of surprises.\n",
        "Before French cinema reinvented itself with jump cuts and cool bobs, Marcel Carne's 19th-century backstage drama was the epitome of good taste: a sumptuous spread of genteel sparring and epic heartache.\n",
        "Marcel Carne's towering intimate epic of early 19th-century love and the lives of performers, often heralded as the greatest French film of all time.\n",
        "Poetry with a capital \"P,\" sprinkled with fairy dust.\n",
        "It runs 187 minutes, and it's worth every one of them.\n",
        "What ultimately defines the film, though, what makes it unforgettable, is its tragic gravity.\n",
        "A marvellously witty, ineffably graceful rondo of passions and perversities.\n",
        "On the basis alone of performance and of its bold, picturesque mise en scene, Les Enfants du Paradis is worth your custom. What you get otherwise is to boot.\n",
        "All discussions of Marcel Carne's Children of Paradise begin with the miracle of its making.\n",
        "The movie has flashes of oldtime magic. It's a precious piece of time past -- and time kept.\n",
        "As a director, Eastwood is not as good as he seems to think he is. As an actor, he is probably better than he allows himself to be.\n",
        "Eastwood's second directorial effort is mechanically stylish.\n",
        "This was supposed to be Eastwood's fond adieu to the worlds of Sergio Leone and Don Siegel; and indeed he cuts the operatic excess of the former with the punchy economy of the latter.\n",
        "Part ghost story, part revenge Western, more than a little silly, and often quite entertaining in a way that may make you wonder if you have lost your good sense.\n",
        "Heeere's Jackie, ageless and great, before refitting himself to Western specs.\n",
        "A fleet, enjoyable Jackie Chan romp.\n",
        "Chan has always seemed like a silent-screen virtuoso self-catapulted into modern times.\n",
        "The extended fight scenes [have been] justly hailed by aficionados as classics of the genre.\n",
        "A spectacularly silly comic epic in which almost every known camera trick, stunt and fight choreography known to the genre is squished into one story.\n",
        "Chan fans will probably want to pay to see this one on the big screen. Everyone else can bide their time for the video release.\n",
        "Enjoy this rare chance to catch Chan on the big screen at his near-peak mastery.\n",
        "Not one of Jackie Chan's better movies.\n",
        "With lots of laughs, lots of blood and the irrepressible Chan pushing the envelope in stunts and spectacularly choreographed group fights.\n",
        "There's no Jackie Chan movie more pleasurable than Drunken Master II, which Miramax's Dimension Films has dubbed into English and rereleased as The Legend of Drunken Master.\n",
        "Chan's most impressive achievement.\n",
        "[Chan's] as close as film gets to guaranteed entertainment, and he's on top of his game in The Legend of Drunken Master.\n",
        "If you have a taste for Hong Kong action (and I do) then The Legend of Drunken Master has enough going on to make it a classic.\n",
        "Massively entertaining.\n",
        "This is one of the films that made Jackie Chan Jackie Chan.\n",
        "The final 20-minute fight sequence ... sets some kind of benchmark: It may not be possible to film a better fight scene.\n",
        "Jackie Chan in top form.\n",
        "Watching movies like this, you also understand exactly why the increasingly road-worn Chan simply can't do this kind of stuff anymore. But damn, you'll walk out glad he once could.\n",
        "The Conformist is celebrated for cinematographer Vittorio Storaro's tumbling autumn leaves, but its emotional impact involves a tumbling soul.\n",
        "Ravishing to the eye but less than fully satisfying to the mind.\n",
        "The movie is pure magic as story, as drama, as photography, as conviction, as everything except its ideas.\n",
        "Juggling past and present with the same bravura flourish as Welles in Citizen Kane, Bertolucci conjures a dazzling historical and personal perspective.\n",
        "... seems every bit the masterpiece it was when first released by Paramount.\n",
        "A great film, drunkenly beautiful and deeply disturbing.\n",
        "As striking as Bertolucci's classic looks, there's even more powerful stuff in the storytelling.\n",
        "An eye-watering testimony to the erstwhile dash of international cinema.\n",
        "There are excesses in the film, but they are balanced by scenes of such unusual beauty and vitality that I couldn't care less.\n",
        "The brilliant mix of ideas, the audacity and originality of approach, the sensualist delight in the ravishing play of light and shadow -- all these remain, as bracing and inspirational as ever.\n",
        "Storaro and Bertolucci have fashioned a visual masterpiece in The Conformist, with some of the best use of light and shadow ever in a motion picture.\n",
        "More like a symphonic poem than a movie. Your breath is taken away by its baroque compositions.\n",
        "For a star-studded big-budget musical, Hairspray does a nice job of retaining the funky sweetness of the original.\n",
        "Bright, campy and wonderfully light, Hairspray reminds us that fun comes in all shapes and sizes. It's also one of the few 'event' movies this summer that doesn't outstay its welcome. That's worth singing about, no matter what your name is.\n",
        "It's amiable, it's bouncy, it's got a sweet unknown in the lead flanked by a cast of bankable stars and, providing as it does an amiable and bouncy and sweet escape from a summer's worth of clunky blockbusters.\n",
        "Hairspray is an infectious aerosol comedy with nearly every hair in place.\n",
        "Hairspray is one of the most enjoyable translations of a Broadway musical to the big screen ever.\n",
        "The movie is a throwback to MGM musicals of the '50s. But it's a giddy, unselfconscious throwback. That in itself is refreshing.\n",
        "It's hard to keep a smile off your face and your toes from tapping during this unpretentious and spirited adaptation of the stage musical by director/choreographer Adam Shankman.\n",
        "At the risk of sounding as manic as Corny Collins, Baltimore's answer to Dick Clark, this latest screen incarnation is guaranteed to flip your wig.\n",
        "With its zesty dancing, strong performances, goofball details and sweet message of acceptance for all, Hairspray might just be this summer's happiest hit.\n",
        "Enjoyable movies are released every week, but movies that have the capacity to delight -- movies like Hairspray -- are few and far between.\n",
        "Adam Shankman's Hairspray is a great big sloppy kiss of entertainment for audiences weary of explosions, CGI effects and sequels, sequels, sequels.\n",
        "Hairspray delivers an even bigger sugar rush than the hit Broadway musical, which had already expanded on the exuberance of the 1988 John Waters comedy that spawned it.\n",
        "Marc Shaiman's peppy music conspires with Shankman's energized, retro-musical choreography to make for a giant cinematic grin -- a dimpled dental testament of faith in the powers of nice over nasty, tolerance over bigotry and aerosol over the ozone.\n",
        "Hairspray is a wondrously entertaining ball of spunky musical numbers, talent set free and fun, fun, fun, with just enough of a message to make it sizzle all the more. Don't miss it.\n",
        "It is the most deliriously enjoyable movie in a summer that hasn't been exactly packed with old-fashioned moviegoing pleasure.\n",
        "Hairspray is just plain fun.\n",
        "Against all expectations, Hairspray turns out to be an explosion of industrial-strength good cheer, delivered by very smart show-biz pros with wit, passion, and a soupcon of dementia. Resistance is futile.\n",
        "John Travolta is no Divine. And this shiny musical just doesn't have the crazy, messy charm of John Waters' original.\n",
        "The vanity is difficult to ignore, but amazingly, the younger performers manage to do exactly that.\n",
        "What it offers isn't really a nostalgic look at a 'more innocent time' so much as a saucy wink at a casually vicious time that is constantly being sold to us as innocent.\n",
        "Sheer perfection-the gold standard of tragic romances whose influence can still be seen to this day.\n",
        "Cyril Raymond manages to invest the stodgy character with a lovable quality.\n",
        "Rarely rises above the level of the old women's magazines.\n",
        "Some films don't age well, and no doubt Brief Encounter had more of an emotional effect in the social climate of post-war Britain.\n",
        "An uncommonly good little picture -- and one which is frankly designed to appeal to that group of film-goers who are provoked by the 'usual movie tripe.'\n",
        "Visually and thematically, it's still one of the most beautiful films ever made.\n",
        "One of the great cinematic achievements of the 1970s.\n",
        "Perhaps the most typical example of a '70s American art film -- daring, romantic, rebellious but also filled with longing for the beauty of the past.\n",
        "Days of Heaven never really makes up its mind what it wants to be.\n",
        "Almost incontestably the most gorgeously photographed film ever made.\n",
        "It is the closest to poetry in motion that I have ever seen.\n",
        "One thing that certainly can be said about Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven: it's not sentimental or manipulative. Unfortunately, it's also not particularly involving.\n",
        "This is a movie made by a man who knew how something felt, and found a way to evoke it in us.\n",
        "Arguably the finest of Malle's early films.\n",
        "Highly introspective, often tenderly touching and sometimes tediously redundant.\n",
        "The film is a triumph of style. It is quiet and indicative. It doesn't explain a lot, but we understand a lot about it all the same.\n",
        "It's a penetrating study of a man at the end of his rope, and a searing re-creation of a social milieu.\n",
        "The picture returns the lately heavily dramatic Barbara Stanwyck to glamor.\n",
        "Barbara Stanwyck is the sexiest con woman ever captured on film.\n",
        "Third writer-director effort of Preston Sturges [from a story by Monckton Hoffe] is laugh entertainment of top proportions with its combo of slick situations, spontaneous dialog and a few slapstick falls tossed in for good measure.\n",
        "Preston Sturges extended his range beyond the crazy farces that had made his reputation with this romantic 1941 comedy, and his hand proved just as sure.\n",
        "A beguilingly ribald sex comedy, spattered with characteristic Sturges slapstick.\n",
        "Now there's no question about it: Preston Sturges is definitely and distinctly the most refreshing new force to hit the American motion pictures in the past five years.\n",
        "A movie like The Lady Eve is so hard to make that you can't make it at all unless you find a way to make it seem effortless. Preston Sturges does a kind of breathless balancing act here, involving romance, deception and physical comedy.\n",
        "Sturges' dialog is trenchant, has drive, possesses crispness and gets the laughs where that is desired.\n",
        "A dubious proposition, but in Sturges's hands a charming one, filled out by his unparalleled sense of eccentric character.\n",
        "Sullivan's Travels is a gem, an almost serious comedy not taken entirely seriously, with wonderful dialogue, eccentric characterisations, and superlative performances throughout.\n",
        "Sullivan's Travels is one of the screen's more 'significant' films.\n",
        "This Prestton Sturges production is packed with delightful absurdities.\n",
        "Rudy Vallee turns in his best performance as a gentle, puny millionaire named Hackensacker in this brilliant, simultaneously tender and scalding 1942 screwball comedy by Preston Sturges.\n",
        "Hilarious, irresistible, impeccably cast.\n",
        "It should have been a breathless comedy. But only the actors are breathless -- and that from talking so much.\n",
        "Sturges' dialogue, as always, is not only sharp, but cutting, delivered with typical flair by the charter members of Sturges' company of actors.\n",
        "There's a pleasing mood to \"Man Facing Southeast\" that makes you want to like it. But the story is so sluggish and takes such illogical twists that you give up.\n",
        "It shows huge promise -- its mystery, its patient pace and its eerie resonance sometimes transcend its didactics.\n",
        "One of the great films noirs, softened just a little by the moralising censorship strictures of the time. See it.\n",
        "Unlike its grittily romantic predecessors, Flashdance is pure glitz.\n",
        "Flashdance might be considered one of the first signs of Hollywood's Apocalypse.\n",
        "Virtually plotless, exceedingly thin on characterization and sociologically laughable, pic at least lives up to its title by offering an anthology of extraordinarily flashy dance numbers.\n",
        "Depressing to think that this was a huge hit on the back of the Irene Cara hit single, since there's absolutely nothing to it.\n",
        "Jennifer Beals shouldn't feel bad. She is a natural talent, she is fresh and engaging here, and only needs to find an agent with a natural talent for turning down scripts.\n",
        "The story doesn't help Miss Beals either, because she's at her least convincing when having to register any emotion other than rapture.\n",
        "Silly but energetic.\n",
        "For casual viewers, the whole thing has a retro charm. For Beatles fans, it's a flawed but essential film.\n",
        "A Hard Day's Night may be more primitive, but it also seems more spontaneous.\n",
        "The boys themselves are exuberant and uninhibited in their own genial way. They just become awfully redundant and -- dare I say it? -- dull.\n",
        "In scene after scene Director Guy Hamilton has contrived some hilariously horrible sight gags.\n",
        "There's not the least sign of staleness in this third sample of the Bond 007 formula.\n",
        "This 1964 entry is the most enjoyable of the James Bond thrillers starring Sean Connery -- perhaps because it's the most comic and cartoony in look as well as conception.\n",
        "Presented here in a newly restored digital print, it should look especially swish on the big screen.\n",
        "... what they give us in Goldfinger is an excess of-science-fiction fun, a mess of mechanical melodrama and a minimum of bedroom farce.\n",
        "If it is not a great film, it is a great entertainment, and contains all the elements of the Bond formula that would work again and again.\n",
        "Although more gimmicky than From Russia with Love, this film is equally as entertaining.\n",
        "The film lacks the exotic, colourful flamboyance of the best of its successors. So shoot me.\n",
        "Sophisticated? Well, not really. But fast, smart, shrewdly directed and capably performed.\n",
        "From Russia with Love is a preposterous, skillful slab of hardhitting, sexy hokum.\n",
        "For my money, still the best Bond, with a screwball plotline that keeps the locales changing and the surprises coming.\n",
        "007 is very much with us again, and anyone who hasn't yet got to know him is urged to do so right away!\n",
        "Standing at the pinnacle of the series, From Russia with Love shows how good a Bond film can be when all the ingredients mesh.\n",
        "All of the elements of the formula are there, but in pleasing moderation.\n",
        "An entertaining piece of tongue-in-cheek action hokum.\n",
        "As memorable as anything in the series.\n",
        "Of course, it's nonsense -- pure, escapist bunk, with Bond, an elegant fellow, played by Sean Connery, doing everything (and everybody) that an idle day-dreamer might like to do.\n",
        "While it may appear tame by the standards of the later productions, it's an entertaining look back in movie history at a project that developed into a worldwide phenomenon.\n",
        "Their romance is enhanced by Nestor Almendros' exquisite photography (and Basil Poledouris' score), as is the stunning beauty of the Fiji island where it was filmed.\n",
        "The only thing blue about the movie is the sea, and the way you'll feel after wasting your time on this dose of 'tasteful', TV commercial-style, nudity.\n",
        "The Blue Lagoon is the dumbest movie of the year.\n",
        "[It] has a nonsensical glaze that contributes to the inadvertent merriment.\n",
        "Witless.\n",
        "Once in a great while a western comes along that breaks new ground and becomes a classic of the genre.\n",
        "This is a hard-hitting item, ably directed, splendidly lensed, neatly acted, which has all the ingredients wanted by action fans and then some.\n",
        "From Clint Eastwood's iconic performance to Ennio Morricone's unforgettable (and much-parodied) musical score, A Fistful of Dollars (****) took the western down trails it had never explored.\n",
        "Though far less operatic and satisfying than Leone's later work, his first spaghetti Western with Eastwood still looks stylish, if a little rough at the edges.\n",
        "Egregiously synthetic but engrossingly morbid, violent film.\n",
        "Really little more than a series of loosely connected shoot-outs -- but, as Sergio Leone proved, there can be a lot of fun in that.\n",
        "Anderson coaxes top-notch performances from the male leads and also from Gwyneth Paltrow.\n",
        "Has ... meaning and truth, not to mention scarred humanity.\n",
        "It is really little more than a small resonant mood piece whose hard-bitten characters are difficult to like. But within its self-imposed limitations, it accomplishes most of what it sets out to do.\n",
        "Noirish thrillers live or die by their plot twists and dialogue... Unfortunately, the script by first-time filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson fails on both counts.\n",
        "It's hugely refreshing to watch a movie populated almost exclusively by character actors.\n",
        "There's something almost hypnotic about the way Hard Eight develops -- even in its slowest, most tedious moments, it keeps our attention.\n",
        "Movies like Hard Eight remind me of what original, compelling characters the movies can sometimes give us.\n",
        "Best of all is Anderson's sense of character, expressed in dialogue that never strains for effect and in his expert handling of a first-rate quartet of actors.\n",
        "We get to see Jackson play one of his scarier characters.\n",
        "Even though the movie doesn't leave much of a residue, it looks terrific while you're watching it: Manhattan has seldom appeared as glitzy or as glamorous.\n",
        "Illogical, flawed or forced thrillers are all too common. Ones that knock your eyes out are rare.\n",
        "A stylish and romantic police thriller which manages, through the sleek direction of Ridley Scott and persuasive ensemble performances, to triumph over several hard-to-swallow plot developments.\n",
        "Most of New York, indoors and out, looks about as good as the Chrysler Building in Scott's gleaming fusion of eternal triangle and killer-on-the-loose.\n",
        "Howard Franklin's screenplay plays less like a feature film than like the pilot for a failed television series about New York policemen.\n",
        "Movies like this are on automatic pilot. Unless we are very young, very naive or hopelessly lusting after one of the stars, there is little to interest us aside from interior decorating hints.\n",
        "Scott, who directed \"Alien\" and \"Blade Runner,\" looks at the world through veils of smog. What with these pictorial pollutants, he loses sight of plot.\n",
        "It is working American Beauty-Susan Faludi territory, that illiberal, impious, inarticulate fringe that threatens the smug American center with an anger that cannot explain itself, can act out its frustrations only in inexplicable violence.\n",
        "Blistering, hallucinatory, often brilliant, the film by David Fincher is a combination punch of social satire and sociopathology.\n",
        "Fight Club is an arresting, eventually appalling excursion into social satire by way of punishing violence.\n",
        "We're meant to take the male bonding and the blood rituals as a protest against the sterility of corporate life and modern design, but Fincher's sadomasochistic kicks overwhelm any possible social critique.\n",
        "This is American self-absorption at its finest.\n",
        "[A] bold, inventive, sustained adrenaline rush of a movie...\n",
        "You can call [it] irresponsible. Or you can call it the only essential Hollywood film of 1999.\n",
        "If it had all continued in the vein explored in the first act, it might have become a great film. But the second act is pandering and the third is trickery.\n",
        "Delivers a sucker punch to the audience and then pulls the rug out from under it. It is sensational.\n",
        "If, as Fincher has said, this movie is supposed to be funny, then the joke's on us.\n",
        "A bloody, hilarious ride into the twisted recesses of the modern male psyche.\n",
        "Along with the superior technical work, the movie shows off its three leads at their best.\n",
        "Extremely funny, surprisingly well-acted, and boldly designed -- at least until its steel-and-chrome souffle falls apart.\n",
        "Relentlessly funny.\n",
        "Fight Club rolls out its indictments and its Zen koans, but what it really resembles, perhaps unknowingly, is the squall of a whiny and essentially white-male generation that feels ruined by the privileges of women and a booming economy.\n",
        "Terribly underwhelming.\n",
        "Bloody mess of a guy film loses its battle to have any real meaning.\n",
        "Certainly no movie in years has had this much subversive fun.\n",
        "A wickedly funny assault on the soul-destroying nature of 20th-century consumerism\n",
        "This is a second-rate Woody Allen midlife crisis comedy without the laughs.\n",
        "This one gets stuck in a rut pretty early on and has difficulty rising out of it.\n",
        "The movie feels shaved down from some larger conception.\n",
        "The Story of Us is flawed, but not seriously enough to curtail its ability to function as unpretentious entertainment.\n",
        "Other people's problems can usually get to you after an hour and 45 minutes. But in Rob Reiner's heartstring-plinking comedy The Story of Us, you just might lose interest during the first 10.\n",
        "The Story of Us is all too willing to settle for superficial comedy and pat answers at the expense of real insight.\n",
        "Though it sets out to explain why this marriage is worth saving, The Story of Us could prompt even single members of the audience to file for divorce.\n",
        "Its manufactured crises and too-glib jokes give it a facile, fraudulent air.\n",
        "This Story doesn't really deliver it.\n",
        "It's so crammed with flashbacks that it loses momentum.\n",
        "Sloppy.\n",
        "The whole has a skittish quality.\n",
        "Pungent, funny, and surprisingly forceful.\n",
        "The film wants us to think that it's insightful and deeper than the usual domestic comedy-drama. It's not.\n",
        "...tries to deal with the messy process of nurturing a proper adult relationship rather than simply shoehorning two lovers into a predictable set of catastrophic circumstances until they finally succumb to one another.\n",
        "Stripped of almost all the brothers' usual crudeness, Fever Pitch proves what we've suspected all along: That beneath the gross-out gags and freak-show humor, Peter and Bobby Farrelly are just a couple of lovable romantics.\n",
        "The film turns out to be a substantial pleasure as the spirit of the Sox shines through.\n",
        "It's slickly done, pleasantly watchable, but despite Barrymore's ever-charming earnestness, not quite a home run.\n",
        "The movie's sentiment is nothing new for the Farrelly brothers, but its complacency certainly is.\n",
        "The filmmakers are split between making the Sox obsession a lovably funny quirk and suggesting that it's haplessly infantile.\n",
        "Barely a screwball comedy, let alone a gunk-loaded spitball like There's Something About Mary.\n",
        "The Farrellys, New Englanders by birth, love the Red Sox so much that they forgive their lead character a multitude of sins that, in any of their other movies, they'd be too gentlemanly (and too humane) to ever allow.\n",
        "Suffers from oddly clunky pacing and long, talky passages of little verbal dexterity and zero interest, import or impact.\n",
        "A romantic comedy with the ultimate in feelgood endings.\n",
        "A romantic comedy that flirts with something serious but never gets past the flirting stage.\n",
        "Fallon is rather good, too, by the way -- his self-effacement here becomes him.\n",
        "One of those nicely grooved pitches with which even a novice ought to be able to connect.\n",
        "The screenplay, by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, struggles to make up for a fundamental lack of suspense.\n",
        "It's sad to watch the kingpins of gross-out try to dial down to cute. Swung at and missed.\n",
        "This Fever isn't catching.\n",
        "The Curse of the Bambino lives. And by now, it's spread to the backlot.\n",
        "At the movie's core is a question that all couples face: How much of one's identity must a person give up in order to make a relationship work? The filmmakers show good marketing sense in balancing the romantic elements with sports.\n",
        "The only thing the Farrellys get right is the obsession, but even the most forgiving Red Sox fan will agree their team deserved more than this.\n",
        "The Sox won the World Series. Rarely have filmmakers had a more wildly improbable happy ending forced on them. Well, you need all the help you can get, divine or otherwise, when your two stars -- Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon -- have no chemistry.\n",
        "Julien donkey-boy acquires a spiritual dimension that allows it ultimately to become an act of redemption.\n",
        "A self-indulgent mess.\n",
        "It adds up to something, unlike a lot of movies where individual shots are sensational, but they add up to nothing.\n",
        "Projects such as Julien exist not to explore the essentials of a film, but to induce in audiences a kind of critical vertigo.\n",
        "Laughably simplistic and confoundingly muddled.\n",
        "Gives 'Great Tribulation' new meaning.\n",
        "Quick-paced editing; good special effects.\n",
        "After a promising start, Omega Code devolves into chase after chase, cliche after cliche, until you've finally forgotten just what it is that darn old code's supposed to do in the first place.\n",
        "Forgive them, Father, they know not what they do.\n",
        "While The Omega Code is occasionally lacking in the techno-wizardry so common in similar films it makes up for it with a good plot.\n",
        "Lynch has slowed the world down and gotten back in touch with it.\n",
        "Another pleasant surprise.\n",
        "Too mannered and weird around the edges to be convincing.\n",
        "A beguiling piece of Americana.\n",
        "One of cinema's most charming actors.\n",
        "Lynch's first movie since Blue Velvet that truly envelops you in its spell.\n",
        "At the center of this film's luminous vision is its perfectly cast star.\n",
        "In short, Lynch as Republican.\n",
        "Lynch and legendary cinematographer Freddie Francis have crafted a hauntingly lovely mise-en-scene.\n",
        "Go with high expectations and be sure to take the children.\n",
        "David Lynch shifts gears in this lyrical miracle of a film about a man and his John Deere riding mower.\n",
        "Exalted work from cinematographer Freddie Francis.\n",
        "The screenplay by John Roach and Mary Sweeney finds poetry and truth.\n",
        "Lyrical, sweet and brimming with optimism about the human condition.\n",
        "It's full of misty romps in the meadows, rain-soaked windshields, assorted puppies and lambs, and a 'bittersweet' theme song that drones incessantly on the sound track.\n",
        "Anouk Aimee has a mature beauty and an ability to project an inner quality that helps stave off the obvious banality of her character, and this goes too for the perceptive Jean-Louis Trintignant as the man.\n",
        "Notoriously schmaltzy but still undeniably eye-catching.\n",
        "They seem two dimly sentient beings moved by memories of conventional affections and the compulsions of ordinary love.\n",
        "The film may have been intended as an ironic comment on the absurdity of human ambition, but it's an irony that explodes in Herzog's face.\n",
        "As a document of a quest and a dream, and as the record of man's audacity and foolish, visionary heroism, there has never been another movie like it.\n",
        "It's a stunning spectacle, an adventure-comedy not quite like any other, and the most benign movie ever made about 19th-century capitalism running amok.\n",
        "Though Scheider is a wry, sensitive actor, he soon gets lost in the vulgar theatrics.\n",
        "Almost every scene is excruciating (and a few are appalling), yet the film stirs an obscene fascination with its rapid, speed-freak cutting and passionate psychological striptease.\n",
        "A self-important, egomaniacal, wonderfully choreographed, often compelling film which portrays the energetic life, and preoccupation with death, of a director-choreographer.\n",
        "It's very pleased with itself.\n",
        "Some of it makes you wince, but a lot of it is great fun.\n",
        "The overall 'philosophical' thrust -- that good guys finish last and that crime does pay -- is designed to make the audience feel very wise, but none of the characters or ideas is allowed to develop beyond its cardboard profile.\n",
        "The structural and stylistic conceit is that when Landau is onscreen, the film is dead serious, even solemn, while Allen's own appearance onscreen signals hilarious satire and priceless one-liners.\n",
        "Dramatically, the film seldom fulfils its promise, and its pessimistic 'moral' -- that good and evil do not always meet with their just deserts -- looks contrived and hollow. Intriguing and patchily effective, nevertheless.\n",
        "The movie's secret strength -- its structure, really -- comes from the truth of the dozens and dozens of particular details through which it arrives at its own very hesitant, not especially comforting, very moving generality.\n",
        "The movie generates the best kind of suspense, because it's not about what will happen to people -- it's about what decisions they will reach.\n",
        "A relative of Hannah and Her Sisters in its duplex structure and of The Purple Rose of Cairo in its bitter theme, Crimes is two movies in one, a blend of Allen's satiric and pretentious dramatic styles.\n",
        "Its hard-to-pin-down tone is frighteningly original -- simultaneously world-weary and adolescent with an aura of perpetual anxiety, as if the characters and filmmakers were in pursuit of a catharsis everyone knows will never come.\n",
        "Of course, it's immaculately crafted and exhilaratingly paced, but in the end it's never as emotionally involving as it could and should be.\n",
        "Scorsese doesn't trust the power of simplicity to rock us.\n",
        "The auteur has definitely left his distinctive mark, but too seldom and too narrowly.\n",
        "Scorsese has delivered a film that's both savage and sorrowing.\n",
        "Bringing Out the Dead is a screaming siren of a film!\n",
        "Despite the lack of energy and the lethargic pace, there's something darkly compelling about Bringing Out the Dead.\n",
        "Bringing Out the Dead is curiously and disappointingly lethargic.\n",
        "Surprisingly lacking in primal impact.\n",
        "An intense, volatile film full of sorrow and wild, mordant humor.\n",
        "Bringing Out the Dead is stunning to look at; unfortunately, it's not terribly satisfying to watch.\n",
        "Anyone with a taste for high-risk filmmaking won't want to miss it.\n",
        "A fiery masterpiece!\n",
        "This film dances on the edge of flat-lining just like the DOAs that are Frank's stock-in-trade.\n",
        "Scorsese is never on autopilot, never panders, never sells out, always goes for broke; to watch his films is to see a man risking his talent, not simply exercising it.\n",
        "The mood is less angst-ridden than hypercaffeinated, as Scorsese keeps cranking the velocity-bloodbath in the reggae inferno, exploding skyline pieta, climactic white light of redemption.\n",
        "This is a film of great beauty, which is found not in its face but in its heart.\n",
        "Bringing Out the Dead not only shows us how difficult it is to get there, it lets us bask, finally, in the achievement.\n",
        "Bringing Out the Dead is as technically brilliant as you would expect from a film directed by Martin Scorsese.\n",
        "Its central story and character are so uninvolving that they're overshadowed by the visaul razzle-dazzle and fail to act as a cohesive for all Scorsese's cinematic tricks.\n",
        "Much of the plot makes little sense.\n",
        "A gay-cliche parade utterly lacking in rhythm, style or drollery.\n",
        "Three to Tango is too careful, too proper in its approach, to shift into high gear.\n",
        "A charming romantic comedy.\n",
        "In trying to be both bold and nonthreatening, the movie ends up seeming tame and mildly offensive.\n",
        "Regrettable.\n",
        "Three To Tango goes too far in its desire to appease an unthinking audience.\n",
        "An essentially subversive comedy with a bubbly, immensely entertaining face.\n",
        "McDermott's natural earnestness serves him well as attorney Bobby Donnell on The Practice, but he shows zero flair for comedy.\n",
        "Smart, sensitive, and relatively sophisticated.\n",
        "Three to Tango trips early and never gets up off the floor.\n",
        "In Three to Tango Neve Campbell is mired in a plot of such stupidity that there is only one thing to do, and that is to look at her.\n",
        "A cute, often very funny romantic comedy.\n",
        "Inept, unfunny, and so brimming with bad ideas it's a wonder it wasn't manufactured by mandrills rather than adult humans.\n",
        "An entertaining lark that's often spry and even radiant, with an end-credit wrap-up that's a hoot.\n",
        "Kutcher and Costner have a kind of visual chemistry that's just as elusive as the other kind. And the connection and contrast between them remind us that Hollywood isn't as forgiving of older male actors as we like to think.\n",
        "Kutcher may soon be ready to anchor a Hollywood sea voyage. But for now, he's still a touch out of his depth.\n",
        "The Guardian does the job required: nothing more, nothing less, and nothing fancy.\n",
        "Little about The Guardian will surprise anyone from one scene to the next, though the ride is hardly unpleasant and the story is generous in scope.\n",
        "The Guardian has the feel of a Sunday feature in a newspaper more than a drama.\n",
        "Costner is suitably Costneresque -- that is, low-key, stoic, and capable of a wry turn here or there.\n",
        "A workmanlike story, an unusual setting, a game cast and a righteous message kind of get lost in the film's excesses. And an imbalance in the leads hampers this by-the-book service-academy drama.\n",
        "Surrounding the flashy heroics, however, is a lot of stilted drama. Unresolved subplots make the movie longer than it needs to be.\n",
        "If you're going to drop $70 mil or so on a movie, you should go ahead and blow $9.99 on the deluxe tier of cable service so you can see how such characters are created on Rescue Me.\n",
        "A popcorn flick like this does best when it sticks to shallow waters.\n",
        "A decade after the commercial and critical flop of Waterworld nearly drowned his career, Kevin Costner is back to sea in The Guardian, and this time his dignity remains afloat.\n",
        "Running on for a butt-numbing two-and-a-half hours, The Guardian overstays whatever forgiving nature one is willing to extend.\n",
        "Entertaining enough but strictly in a wait-for-cable way.\n",
        "Valor does emerge in The Guardian, but often is eclipsed by an effects-driven star vehicle.\n",
        "Both veteran director Andrew Davis and writer Ron L. Brinkerhoff know a cliche when they see one... so they dutifully point them out to us in this predictable tale of a much-decorated rescue swimmer passing the torch to a promising new recruit.\n",
        "While it's not completely waterlogged, The Guardian is more than a bit soggy. It begins efficiently familiar and ends with a series of splashes that seem like desperate dogpaddling.\n",
        "Ipcress proves again that one of the primal pleasures of moviegoing is a tingling, no-nonsense suspense yarn enlivened by honest good humor.\n",
        "Caine skillfully resists any temptation he may have had to pep up the proceedings. In fact, his consistent underplaying adds considerably to the pull of the picture.\n",
        "Deighton's plot is a mild headache of deceit and double-dealing that glides stylishly and with much wit around Caine's Sergeant Palmer, a cocky London bachelor and middle-ranking scion of the MoD's counter-espionage department.\n",
        "The Ipcress File is as classy a spy film as you could ask to see.\n",
        "Verhoeven's strong suits have always been visual energy and a Rabelaisan realism: a gutsy, jovial way of ripping through social systems.\n",
        "RoboCop relies for most of its impact -- and, more disturbingly, for much of its comedy -- on an absurd exaggeration of physical force.\n",
        "When the law-enforcing RoboCop cleans up corrupt Motown, his victory is satisfying because he's got machinery and morals on his side. RoboCop is where high-tech meets High Noon.\n",
        "Like the tormented figure at its center, this movie combines the mechanical with the human. And though much of the film is made up of spare parts from cop shows, exploitation flicks and comic books, it nevertheless comes to life.\n",
        "A sci-fi action film with a silly title that turned out to be a biting satire of big business practices.\n",
        "There's a brooding, agonized quality to the violence that almost seems subversive, as if Verhoeven were both appalled and fascinated by his complicity in the toxic action rot.\n",
        "Vile, violent, and very funny. The pace is breakneck, and when the wit does run out, way-out weaponry and whole-scale destruction keep the appalled excitement burning.\n",
        "Whatever may have been in the minds of the writers, Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner, has more trouble emerging from Mr. Verhoeven's sizzling battles than poor Murphy does from his robosuit.\n",
        "RoboCop is as tightly worked as a film can be, not a moment or line wasted.\n",
        "Most thriller and special-effects movies come right off the assembly line...RoboCop is a thriller with a difference.\n",
        "...RoboCop is one weird and entertaining hybrid of camp and sci-fi shoot-'em-up.\n",
        "...Verhoeven strives for bloodcurdling, darkly comic eloquence. He gives us heart with the hardware. Savagery with smarts.\n",
        "For audiences who grew up with cartoons as a natural part of their moviegoing, the shock may not be the mix of live and animated folk--it may come from the truly revolutionary sight of great icons of rival studios cheerfully rubbing shoulders.\n",
        "Imagine watching cartoon characters and relating to them as if they were flesh-and-blood instead of paint-and-ink. This is the slap-happy effect of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and - please - a 24-carrot salute to director Robert Zemeckis.\n",
        "If the pleasures of Who Framed Roger Rabbit are mostly incidental, they are certainly more than considerable.\n",
        "This is a movie that demands to be seen twice. The first time, one is likely to be dazzled to the point of exhaustion; the second time, one can appreciate the artistry and good humor more easily.\n",
        "More than a technological wonder, Who Framed Roger Rabbit? is brilliantly funny, bracingly smart and surprisingly moving.\n",
        "The opening cartoon upstages the movie that emerges from it.\n",
        "A Hollywood entertainment that lived up to its hype.\n",
        "The real stars are the animators, under British animation director Richard Williams, who pull off a technically amazing feat of having humans and Toons seem to be interacting with one another.\n",
        "Supremely entertaining -- especially for adults.\n",
        "Roger looks terrific after 15 years.\n",
        "Although this isn't the first time that cartoon characters have shared the screen with live actors, it's the first time they've done it on their own terms.\n",
        "A mix of live action and animation, the $45 million movie is as cunning as Wile E. Coyote and chipper as a flock of cartoon bluebirds.\n",
        "Sheer, enchanted entertainment from the first frame to the last -- a joyous, giddy, goofy celebration of the kind of fun you can have with a movie camera.\n",
        "Not only a technical tour de force, it crackles with entertainment.\n",
        "Roger Moore has crumpled his comic-strip good looks into something approaching world-weariness, and the newfound maturity in his expression is reflected in director John Glen's style, which goes for the measured and elegant over the flashy and excessive.\n",
        "Moore is merely the best-oiled cog in this perpetual motion machine.\n",
        "One of the most thoroughly enjoyable of the 12 Bond pix [to date] despite fact that many of the usual ingredients in the successful 007 formula are missing.\n",
        "Look, Ma, no plot and poor dialogue, and Moore really is old enough to be the uncle of those girls.\n",
        "Let's face it: When you've seen one impregnable mountaintop fortress, you've seen 'em all.\n",
        "By the end of the '80s, Bond would be viewed as something of a relic, but at least the decade opened with an enjoyable outing.\n",
        "The Bond women are pallid mannequins, and so is the misused Dalton -- a moving target in a Savile Row suit. For every plausible reason, he looks as bored in his second Bond film as Sean Connery did in his sixth.\n",
        "The thrills-and-spills chases are superbly orchestrated as pic spins at breakneck speed through its South Florida and Central American locations.\n",
        "Despite some shaky narrative continuity and muddled motivations, this manages to move pretty briskly, and the action sequences are generally well handled, especially at the climax.\n",
        "It's all very pacy, with the overly straightforward plotting dimmed but not obscured by the hi-tech effects.\n",
        "Mr. Dalton is perfectly at home as an angry Bond, and as a romantic lead and as an action hero, but he never seems to blend any two of those qualities at once.\n",
        "The stunts all look convincing, and the effect of the closing sequence is exhilarating.\n",
        "Dalton plays a straight-faced, humorless, no-nonsense Bond -- all guns and no play -- and it makes for a very dull time.\n",
        "You may find yourself shaken -- not stirred -- by the screenwriting cruelty and cynicism behind the 16th Bond.\n",
        "Licence to Kill may be taut and gripping, but it's not traditional Bond, and that, as much as any other reason, may explain the public's rejection of this reasonably well-constructed picture.\n",
        "Guy Hamilton's direction lacks enthusiasm and pace, while even the art direction -- long the Bond films' real secret weapon -- seems to have fallen to a shrunken budget.\n",
        "The comic book plot meanders through a series of hardware production numbers.\n",
        "Setting aside an allright speedboat spectacular over land and water, the film is both perfunctory and predictable -- leaving the mind free to wander into the question of its overall taste. Or lack of it.\n",
        "Two hours long and anti-climactic, but Bond fans won't be disappointed.\n",
        "Live and Let Die has been especially well photographed and edited, and it makes clever and extensive use of its good title song, by Paul and Linda McCartney.\n",
        "It doesn't have the wit and it doesn't have the style of the best Bond movies.\n",
        "The only thing about Live and Let Die to weather the test of time is its title song.\n",
        "If Thunderball's gimmickry seems to overreach at times, Actor Connery gains assurance from film to film, by now delivers all his soppiest Jimcracks martini-dry.\n",
        "Slightly bloated Bond, with too much technology for my taste and a climactic slaughter that's a little too mindless to be much fun.\n",
        "There's visible evidence that the reported $5.5 million budget was no mere publicity figure; it's posh all the way.\n",
        "The fourth Bond, marking the point at which spectacular hardware began to dominate the series. Sleek and quite fun all the same.\n",
        "The color is handsome. The scenery in the Bahamas is an irresistible lure. Even the violence is funny. That's the best I can say for a Bond film.\n",
        "Classic 007 -- not the best picture in the long-running series, to be sure, but a more-than-worthwhile diversion for the action-loving escapist in us all.\n",
        "That final scene. Last week, CNN asked -- in \"The Screening Room's Top 10 Romantic Moments\" -- whether this was the most touching film moment of all time. Could be. Either way, if it doesn't move you, you're beyond human reach.\n",
        "Only someone with slow-drying cement in their veins wouldn't be moved.\n",
        "With its themes of selflessness and grace, as well as its graceful intertwining of comedy and pathos, this is a fine time for a revisit.\n",
        "Is this film still funny after 76 years? I think and hope it is.\n",
        "The British comic is still the consummate pantomimist, unquestionably one of the greatest the stage or screen has ever known.\n",
        "A beautiful example of Chaplin's ability to turn narrative fragments into emotional wholes. The two halves of the film are sentiment and slapstick. They are not blended but woven into a pattern as eccentric as it is sublime.\n",
        "Plenty of great moments, and the occasional comic use of sound.\n",
        "A film worked out with admirable artistry.\n",
        "Contains some of Chaplin's great comic sequences.\n",
        "It's an altogether wonderful gem, and one of the five best films the silent era has to offer.\n",
        "Meryl dominates the proceedings. She simply disappears into the role, and the movie, for all its educational impulses, becomes about watching her do it.\n",
        "Music of the Heart doesn't take you anywhere you haven't been before, but it's still an enjoyable ride.\n",
        "Music of the Heart is nothing if not a change of pace, and, unfortunately, Craven doesn't appear entirely comfortable in these new surroundings.\n",
        "The tone of inspirational uplift is familiar from movies like Stand and Deliver and Mr. Holland's Opus -- which is to say, it's familiarly awful.\n",
        "One of the year's most heartfelt movies.\n",
        "Boring as it may have become for Meryl Streep to show up for awards ceremonies, count on her to be doing it again.\n",
        "Some people will warm to Music of the Heart, and for those people the idea of criticizing the film will be like kicking a puppy.\n",
        "To see Streep's prickly pear of an instructor blossom along with her struggling students is a rare joy.\n",
        "Most movies claiming to be based on fact pour on the melodrama, but this one basically just sticks to the real story, which has all the emotional wallop that's needed.\n",
        "Solid raw material, but the execution is overcooked: The kids are cutesy, and Meryl Streep as Roberta is hyperaddled and indecisive about which outer-borough accent to affect.\n",
        "It may be premature to think Craven just doesn't spark outside the horror genre, but there's nothing here to suggest the opposite.\n",
        "Streep's extraordinary performance makes this the rare inspirational movie that actually is, well, inspirational.\n",
        "A movie that tells a story not from some Hollywood swifty's febrile imagination, but rather from life.\n",
        "I've always had a soft spot for teacher movies, and this one is high on my list.\n",
        "All other credits are pro, with a special nod to Peter Deming's subtly nuanced camerawork.\n",
        "Music is a calculated but effective film.\n",
        "For its first three laps, this inspirational - teacher movie moves too slowly, even with the head start I give inspirational - teacher movies.\n",
        "Another utterly bland lump of Hollywood crapola.\n",
        "Overwrought tearjerker, directed without a shred of subtlety.\n",
        "There really is a Roberta Guaspari, but this dull, wanly repetitive teacher movie fails to bring her story to life.\n",
        "Devilishly inventive and so far out there it's almost off the scale.\n",
        "This outrageous comic fantasy may not sustain its brilliance throughout its 112 minutes, but it keeps cooking for so much of that time that I don't have many complaints.\n",
        "By the time the tunnel worthy of the likes of Gulliver and Alice becomes a freeway clogged with bit players, a big chill has descended on all the characters.\n",
        "This must be seen to be believed, a hundred carat cult item -- and all credit to Malkovich for playing along.\n",
        "It is hard to mix moods -- the film is manic, subtle, comic and vaguely sad -- but [Jonze] does it masterfully.\n",
        "It's clever, witty, dark and, most importantly, unwaveringly bizarre.\n",
        "It's tremendously entertaining, and probably worthy of repeat viewings.\n",
        "Wonderfully inventive, wickedly funny, and thoughtful enough to keep your mind on full alert, it's a square peg in the round world of genre films.\n",
        "The most excitingly original movie of the year.\n",
        "Being John Malkovich is more than just the latest cool, smart, funny movie. It jumps off the screen with the kind of freshness, originality, and light-handed stranglehold on the Zeitgeist that moves movies forward.\n",
        "Dazzlingly singular movies aren't often this much fun.\n",
        "Either Being John Malkovich gets nominated for best picture, or the members of the Academy need portals into their brains.\n",
        "Surreal to the point of poeticism.\n",
        "Weird to the max, smart, sneaky as a Wall Street pickpocket and revved up with cruel wit and brazen imagination, Being John Malkovich is a dark movie comedy that you couldn't forget if you tried.\n",
        "Highly original script.\n",
        "A hilariously novel conception.\n",
        "A supremely, almost effortlessly inventive and hilarious experience.\n",
        "It may not be clear just what that means, but like the rest of the Malkovich experience it's a lot of fun going down.\n",
        "Different from anything that came before it.\n",
        "A beautifully articulated and acutely perceptive work with impeccable, carefully shaded performances.\n",
        "Beautifully shot and often moving.\n",
        "Viewers have almost two hours to become thoroughly disgusted\n",
        "The Bachelor doesn't generate enough laughs or sighs to hold together.\n",
        "An acceptable comedy.\n",
        "Steve Cohen's screenplay, is pretty much DOA.\n",
        "A pretty lame premise for a movie.\n",
        "You know a movie is desperately overreaching when Peter Ustinov, affecting a dreadful southern accent as Jimmy's grandfather, must yell into a megaphone for no apparent reason: 'The human condition!'\n",
        "Probably the best that can be said about The Bachelor is that it gave a lot of work to female extras.\n",
        "The funny thing is, nobody who made The Bachelor seems to notice that the script pinpoints its own formulaic emptiness before wheezing on to its foregone happy ending.\n",
        "Feeble and formulaic.\n",
        "O'Donnell and Zellweger are easy on the eyes, but we're asked to take it on faith that they have other qualities that would make a person care for them.\n",
        "The new film takes a heavy approach to plain foolishness and doesn't exactly gain loft from the presence of O'Donnell in the centerpiece role. His range is limited to several shades of bland.\n",
        "Its satire is too broad to carry much of a sting.\n",
        "Desperately unfunny.\n",
        "Unremittingly vulgar and inept.\n",
        "[A] wily thriller, which revitalizes a familiar premise by turning it inside out.\n",
        "As unexpected as some of its plot twists is the fact that this unapologetic genre movie was directed by Spike Lee, who has never sold himself as Mr. Entertainment. But here it is, a Spike Lee joint that's downright fun.\n",
        "A slick, kinetic and relatively straightforward -- which is to say enjoyably twisty-turny -- tranche of cat-and-mouse procedural.\n",
        "I gloried in the sheer spectacle of Jodie Foster as Madeline White, an exquisitely groomed, fearlessly feline fixer striding on her high heels and her high horse into one supposedly perilous situation after another.\n",
        "It's very satisfying.\n",
        "Even past the midway point, it's all working -- it's taut, it's funny, it's trenchant, it's stylish. And then it isn't.\n",
        "Inside Man has an abundance of riches.\n",
        "Inside Man is a potboiler, but an intriguing one; perhaps Lee should go Hollywood more often.\n",
        "Inside Man is an exercise in showy, cynical hollowness.\n",
        "Exceptionally well written with clever twists and witty dialogue by first-time screenwriter Russell Gewirtz, Inside Man is adroitly executed by director Spike Lee.\n",
        "Intercutting post-robbery interrogation scenes with the action at hand, makes Inside Man a substantial and satisfying affair.\n",
        "It's a leisurely stroll through the caper genre, with twists aplenty.\n",
        "Lee seems less interested in scoring easy sociological points than ratcheting up the stakes of Gewirtz's cunning heist scenario, which offers little in the way of wiggle room for latecomers.\n",
        "Inside Man is the sort of movie that makes you think. The big star heist thriller is coiled in tricky turns of plot.\n",
        "Inside Man, a crackling, twisty thriller about a bank heist that shows he [Spike Lee] can make an expensive, mainstream movie that's every bit as well-crafted as the personal, arty films to which he has devoted most of his career.\n",
        "Lee takes the usual potshots at this stewpot of race, power and politics. Only here it's effective as part of the story, as opposed to when it's wielded like a tire iron in the context of a polemic.\n",
        "Unexpectedly funny, leisurely paced and oblivious to the demands of its genre, Inside Man has a loose, playful vibe that's at odds with its grave life-and-death scenario.\n",
        "Inside Man may be a genre flick, but its direction is certifiably Lee -- sprinkled with trademark themes and visual cues, including his specialty, the strapped-to-a-factory-belt dolly shot.\n",
        "Inside Man brings Lee back into the mainstream while still letting him have some fun, and he passes that fun on to the audience.\n",
        "Inside Man gives us back the stuff that once made Lee's movies entertaining: the snappy, sassy dialogue, the hip attitude, the obvious insight into the racial divide.\n",
        "The material is simple and irresistible, and Sydney Pollack stages it well (though without transcending the essential superficiality of his talent).\n",
        "A sordid spectacle of hard times, a kind of existentialist allegory of life.\n",
        "The acting is strident and overblown, the narrative technique gimmicky and obvious, and the implication that the competitors' situation is a microcosm of a wider-reaching American malaise rather pretentious.\n",
        "The movie is by far the best thing that Pollack has ever directed (with the possible exception of The Scalphunters).\n",
        "There's no room for Buster to stretch out; none of the rhythms are remotely like his own.\n",
        "The over-the-top acting that Gordon encouraged in Re-Animator is continued here with Combs particularly adept at the darkly comic throwaway line.\n",
        "The excessive blood-spurting gruesomeness and cartoonish stop-motion effects trivialise the horror and undercut the would-be black humour in this travestied sequel to Stuart Gordon's hugely enjoyable film.\n",
        "Less a sequel to the critically praised 1985 horror film Re-Animator than a rehash based on the same H. P. Lovecraft stories.\n",
        "Brian Yusna has replaced Stuart Gordon in the director's chair, without bringing new life to the affair. Even the jokes in the Woody Keith/Rick Fry screenplay seem refried, suggesting that all too much of this Bride is old and borrowed...\n",
        "Coma is an extremely entertaining suspense drama in the Hitchcock tradition.\n",
        "See it and worry.\n",
        "The aftereffect of Coma is a catlike yawn, benign and bored.\n",
        "Michael Crichton's slow-paced thriller must have begun with something to say about the morality of the medical profession, but whatever it was is lost in the shuffle of unnecessary narrative detail.\n",
        "George Romero, collaborating with writer Stephen King, again proves his adeptness at combining thrills with tongue-in-cheek humor.\n",
        "This five-part film, based on the format of 50s horror comics, marks one of the few times George Romero has directed someone else's script (it's by Stephen King), and the results are only mildly interesting by the standards of his Dead trilogy.\n",
        "he old Amicus movies used EC originals to better effect and with more brevity, for all their cardboard sets.\n",
        "Romero and King have approached this movie with humor and affection, as well as with an appreciation of the macabre.\n",
        "Horror film purists may object to the levity even though failed, as a lot of it is.\n",
        "All the actors are used expertly, but it's Burroughs, cropping up near the end, who articulates the film's sociopolitical moral in a contemporary context.\n",
        "No previous drug-themed film has the honesty or originality of Gus Van Sant's drama Drugstore Cowboy.\n",
        "Though hardly earth-shakingly original, Van Sant's low-budget movie takes a cool, contemplative and sometimes comic look at American drug-culture.\n",
        "The film takes us so deeply into this shabby, transient world that we feel its texture -- both its scary thrills and its bleak, fatalistic uncertainty.\n",
        "The movie stars Matt Dillon, in one of the great recent American movie performances.\n",
        "The performers make their affectlessness expressive.\n",
        "Ultimately it's Dillon who has the biggest score; he makes this stark trip a heady, hopeful one.\n",
        "None of the characters ever rises beyond the level of his or her generic functions, and by the end the overall emptiness of the conception becomes fully apparent.\n",
        "Let's face it, there is an element of truth in the character of D-FENS. But it is, finally, tabloid truth.\n",
        "At first comes across like a mean-spirited black comedy and then snowballs into a reasonably powerful portrait of social alienation. The tone is unremittingly dour, however.\n",
        "A real artist could make something incisive or darkly hilarious out of this moral tightrope act. Schumacher, veering recklessly between social satire, kick-ass fantasy and damsel-in-distress melodrama, plays the game for opportunistic cheap thrills.\n",
        "Sometimes funny, sometimes touching, and certainly unnerving.\n",
        "It turns one man's slide toward madness into a wickedly mischievous, entertaining suspense thriller.\n",
        "Douglas's intentionally robotic -- and intense -- performance holds its own. He's scary, normal and funny all at once...\n",
        "Unfortunately, it continues on through an uninspired series of cartoonishly brutal social insults, each one growing more lethal than the next, thereby justifying an increasingly lethal response.\n",
        "The film ... is actually about a great sadness which turns into madness, and which can afflict anyone who is told, after many years of hard work, that he is unnecessary and irrelevant.\n",
        "Although it takes a number of wrong turns, Falling Down still has the power to disturb.\n",
        "Falling Down is a brutally manipulative revenge fantasy, a piece of comic-strip demagoguery that teeters uneasily on the brink of satire.\n",
        "Though there's never much doubt how the duel will end, the climax is nonetheless surprising and totally satisfying, topping the energy of the previous pursuit.\n",
        "A terrorist hijacking a cable car, even in New York, is a mildly ludicrous idea -- were no 747s handy? The plot of Nighthawks makes no sense.\n",
        "All of it is standard stuff, and yet Nighthawks has been assembled with enough pep to make it feel fresh.\n",
        "A movie that is both a wow of a show and a masterpiece of misanthropy.\n",
        "Action-packed, highly comic 1961 translation of Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest.\n",
        "If the plot sounds familiar, it's probably because Leone stole it for A Fistful of Dollars.\n",
        "Even Eastwood's Man With No Name is inspired, perhaps, by the samurai in Yojimbo.\n",
        "Despite the sometime appearance of the whole thing as a forthright travesty, it does have stretches of excitement and cinematic power.\n",
        "It is fair to say that, without Yojimbo, certain key aspects of Western cinema would not be the same today.\n",
        "Rousing, good story, told with vigor and visual excitement by Akira Kurosawa, and splendidly acted by Toshiro Mifune, this has ideal remake material for a Yank company.\n",
        "The crew flings itself energetically through space in search of laughs, but it will never penetrate the galaxy where Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein traced their giddy orbits.\n",
        "The film's low-tech styling is roughly the cardboard inversion of the cinematic machines it parodies, and Brooks seems less inclined than usual to push the overkill urges too far.\n",
        "Mel Brooks will do anything for a laugh. Unfortunately, what he does in Spaceballs, a misguided parody of the Star Wars adventures, isn't very funny.\n",
        "Typically, the best conceits end in pratfalls, and non-Brooks fans may find that the gravitational pull towards the thumpingly obvious outweighs the wit.\n",
        "If it isn't likely to generate what Mr. Brooks himself refers to as 'Spaceballs II: The Search for More Money, neither is it anything less than gentle, harmless satire that occasionally has real bite.\n",
        "How do you review a movie like this, anyway? I guess by saying whether you laughed or not. I did laugh, but not enough to recommend the film.\n",
        "The jokes in the films are all pretty much in the same vein -- you might call it borsch-belt postmodern -- and they're all on about the same level, too.\n",
        "Henry Fonda stars, as brilliant as ever.\n",
        "James Cagney is simply great as the captain of the ship.\n",
        "The acting is the only reason to watch it.\n",
        "A strikingly superior entertainment.\n",
        "Might it be a serious attempt to right some unretrievable wrong via gallows humor which avoids the polemics? This seems to be the course taken; the attempt at least can be respected in theory.\n",
        "An endlessly entertaining attempt to spin an epic in the form of a yarn.\n",
        "A Face in the Crowd has never ceased to be relevant.\n",
        "What starts out as a seemingly liberal tract rapidly becomes a smug, cynical exercise in misanthropy.\n",
        "This sizzling and cynical exposure... also presents Andy Griffith as the key figure in his first screen role.\n",
        "Andy Griffith, as a hick radio star modeled on Arthur Godfrey, delivers an astonishing, sinister performance in Elia Kazan's 1957 essay on media demagoguery.\n",
        "Trading Places also makes Eddie Murphy a force to be reckoned with.\n",
        "This 1983 film re-creates a screwball comedy format and then eliminates everything but the crudest audience-gratification elements; any incursions into the more morally complicated side of the genre are quickly curtailed.\n",
        "Trading Places is a light romp geared up by the schtick shifted by Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy.\n",
        "As a satire on the internecine savagery of fiscal doings under late Reaganite capitalism, the movie is not as biting as it thinks it is; but it's still the best hoot since Arthur.\n",
        "What's most visible in the movie is the engaging acting. Murphy and Aykroyd are perfect foils for each other.\n",
        "[A] shrewd but very likable movie.\n",
        "Through it all, Murray smiles and forges ahead, but his big riffs have been edited down to frantic bursts of mugging.\n",
        "It's difficult to come up with a more cliche situation for a summer pic than a summer camp, where all the characters and plot turns are readily imaginable. That makes director Ivan Reitman's accomplishment all the more noteworthy.\n",
        "Camp counsellor Tripper (Murray) is a John Belushi clone whose 'charisma' dominates the film's standard wackiness and sentimental story (of a kid who doesn't fit).\n",
        "A cheerful, if not particularly deft, summer-camp comedy.\n",
        "Branagh's contemporary American accent is annoying, and the film's constant inter-cutting of past and present lives becomes laughable.\n",
        "As the twists come thick and fast and the plot gets progressively more and more baroque, Branagh shows himself to be at least as intelligent as Brian De Palma in delivering over-the-top stylistic filigree.\n",
        "Director and star Kenneth Branagh brings the same zest and bravura style to this actors' romp of a mystery-thriller as he did to Henry V.\n",
        "Branagh's lame stab at a romantic psychological thriller makes no sense.\n",
        "A big, convoluted, entertainingly dizzy romantic mystery melodrama. It's also another coup de cinema for Mr. Branagh.\n",
        "A miscalculation from a prodigious talent who has forgotten that you squeeze the life out of romance when you don't give it space to breathe.\n",
        "I am a particular pushover for movies like this, movies that could go on the same list with Rebecca, Wuthering Heights or Vertigo.\n",
        "An achievement that rivals Hitchcock's best work and stands out as one of the most intriguing and memorable thrillers of the 1990s.\n",
        "Overwrought and overly facile look at accounts payable in the afterlife.\n",
        "The movie isn't just unpretentious; it's garishly, thrillingly vulgar.\n",
        "Peter's Friends won't win over anyone looking for depth - as drama, it's pure popcorn - but the vignettes are swept along by Branagh's richly theatrical temperament and by the exuberant wit of the cast.\n",
        "Many of the lines and the shadings brought to them by these expert performers are good for some laughs, and pic has plenty of energy, but it can't be taken as seriously as it wants to be.\n",
        "Most will guess the pay-off, but it's an amiable enterprise.\n",
        "Although it addresses AIDS more directly than many films have, it remains a lightweight entertainment, enjoyable mostly for the fun of hearing arch, skillful actors deliver droll remarks.\n",
        "If film is basically a voyeuristric medium, then one of the questions that might be asked about \"Peter's Friends\" is: Would we like to be one of these friends, and attend such a reunion ourselves? I would.\n",
        "With a smattering of one-liners, and a dash of ironic spirit, \"Peter's Friends\" is a diverting, if modest affair.\n",
        "Mostly a hodgepodge of stale show-biz stereotypes mixed with the brand of schmaltzy emotionalism that can be bought off the rack of any store on Rodeo Drive.\n",
        "Less incredible than interminable.\n",
        "Warm-hearted, funny, and involving.\n",
        "Vanessa Williams adds marquee value as a police negotiator.\n",
        "A deluge of movies is set to be released in the next three weeks. One that should not be lost in the flood is Light It Up.\n",
        "Light It Up benefits from affecting performances from a gifted cast headed by R&B heartthrob Usher Raymond.\n",
        "The problem is the movie is too predictable--so predictable that it keeps it from truly generating suspense.\n",
        "Strong acting, tense plot.\n",
        "Painfully obvious and cliched.\n",
        "Light It Up challenges the bureaucratic structure that condemns many children to an educational purgatory.\n",
        "Nelson, Whitaker and their talented, young co-stars give this film most of whatever juice it has.\n",
        "Writer-director Craig Bolotin wants to get our motors racing, our minds pondering and our hearts pumping. Laudable goals; shaky results.\n",
        "Crackling dialogue, surprising intelligence and an emotional wallop.\n",
        "The dialogue is ridiculous and condescending.\n",
        "Portman is excellent, balancing wisdom and petulance, loyalty and imposition...\n",
        "As a depiction of a loving-turbulent relationship between a single mom (Susan Sarandon) and her rebellious teenage daughter (Natalie Portman), Wang's meller is nicely crafted but old-fashioned like Hollywood's weepies of yesteryear.\n",
        "The movie drops in on a crucial part of their lives, follows it for a few minutes and then jettisons to another episode. It's like watching 10 short stories.\n",
        "Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman put on an acting clinic that's a treat to watch, but, no matter how accomplished, a clinic is not a movie. They do a lot with a little, yet it's far from enough.\n",
        "You start wishing you were anywhere but here -- preferably at last year's far funnier Slums of Beverly Hills.\n",
        "Portman's terrific performance in Anywhere But Here is replete with razor's-edge emotions, a watchful stillness, and an exact physical sense of how a teenager struggles to fit into her own body.\n",
        "It's a relief to see Portman giving a realistic, moving performance.\n",
        "Adele and Ann don't really seem like mother and daughter; their conflicts are more a matter of theatrical convenience than something born in the blood.\n",
        "Wang affirms that he is one of a few male directors capable of bringing a film to the screen that focuses on credible, intelligent female characters.\n",
        "Sarandon bravely makes Adele into a person who is borderline insufferable. This isn't Auntie Mame, but someone with deep conflicts and inappropriate ways of addressing them. And Ann is complex, too.\n",
        "Both Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman deserve to make the short list in February for breathing fresh air into an all-too-familiar mother-daughter act.\n",
        "This Wayne Wang-directed movie hands Sarandon one of the richest comic-dramatic opportunities of her career -- while also confirming Portman as one of her own generation's best and brightest.\n",
        "Anywhere But Here brought me to tears often, but it was not that often when something sad happened.\n",
        "Sarandon is good, but Portman is astonishing.\n",
        "Some characters breathe better on the page, and that is the case here.\n",
        "Mr. Wang once again works splendidly with actresses, and boy, does he have a lot to work with this time.\n",
        "Anywhere But Here is a wonderful showcase for Natalie Portman, who gives an Oscar-caliber performance.\n",
        "A very vulgar pro-faith comedy rather than a sacrilegious goof, Dogma is an extraordinarily uneven film that significant cutting might be able to transform into a playable one.\n",
        "I couldn't care less whether Smith's metaphysical conceits about the war between Good and Evil are those of a devout believer or an atheist. The bottom line is that they're puerile.\n",
        "Dogma is more strained than funny.\n",
        "Too talky, too fond of in-jokes, too caught up (especially during the dismally weak climax) in its crass comic-strip ethos, and not, finally, as funny, subversive or thought-provoking as it would like to be.\n",
        "A fresh premise gradually turns stale, and jokes that start out lively end up pooped.\n",
        "Thou shalt not stop laughing.\n",
        "Uproariously hilarious.\n",
        "Like the worst seasons of Saturday Night Live, most of the film's setups go nowhere or just fall flat.\n",
        "Smith is a spirited jester, and parts of Dogma are bright, icon-busting fun, but most of it is a god-awful mess.\n",
        "The result is a mish-mash of tones in which such absurdities as singer Alanis Morissette's appearance as God undercut any emotional responses you might have to the climaxes involving Bartleby and Bethany.\n",
        "Supremely moving!\n",
        "Once the ball is put in play, the viewer must endure a flat second half, indulging torturously static explanations delivered by characters so garrulous they make those of Eric Rohmer seem as tight-lipped as Silent Bob.\n",
        "Smith has made a movie that reflects the spirit in which many Catholics regard their church. He has positioned his comedy on the balance line between theological rigidity and secular reality, which is where so many Catholics find themselves.\n",
        "Smith has crammed the film with enough genuinely funny moments and insightful bits to make it well worth seeing.\n",
        "Deliriously funny!\n",
        "When Smith's not practicing the humor of outrage, he's preaching to a choir highly likely to be perplexed.\n",
        "Deliriously audacious, one-of-a-kind.\n",
        "Dogma is a raucous, profane but surprisingly endearing piece of work, a funny and lively film of ideas.\n",
        "As always with Kevin Smith's films, the strongest element is the writing, and he's reached a new level here.\n",
        "The lack of a plausible leading lady is enough to sink what is otherwise an eye-catching, although heavily '90s-style, telling of one of history's most frequently filmed stories.\n",
        "Both visually spectacular and staggeringly awful.\n",
        "I've never left a Luc Besson movie not thinking that the guy has Froot Loops for brains.\n",
        "Besson is unable to weave the comic scenes together with the serious gory ones, so both seem increasingly jarring and unbelievable.\n",
        "Nothing less than a miracle saved France, The Messenger tells us, and nothing less than a miracle would be needed to rescue this film from itself.\n",
        "Half-baked.\n",
        "Fails on nearly every count.\n",
        "It's hard to recommend it to people who like action and blood because of all the talking; and, because of all the blood, it's hard to recommend it to those who might be interested in the talk.\n",
        "While The Messenger feeds our appetite for visual panache, it starves the soul.\n",
        "Marvelously shot.\n",
        "Besson seems to have no sense that Joan herself was giving a performance.\n",
        "The story is a humourless retread of a Bond-style world domination yarn with a Frankenstein theme.\n",
        "The repetitive plot is essentially a string of excuses for fantastical combat sequences, but somehow several characters' insistence that violence is bad doesn't come off as hypocritical.\n",
        "The wisdom of putting bad experiences behind us never rang more true than after viewing this movie. Avoiding it though, may be impossible, so be prepared.\n",
        "For the record, it isn't terrible. It's far from a milestone in Japanese animation, and not an especially memorable entertainment. Yet it doesn't try to be either of those things.\n",
        "It's just a sound-and-light show, linked to the marketing push for Pokemon in general.\n",
        "Adults may cringe at the preachy heavy-handedness and the extremely limited motion animation that sets the art form back a couple of generations.\n",
        "With intentionally stilted animation, uninspired music and lame jokes, Pokemon is basically an ultralong version of the phenomenon's own boring TV 'toon.\n",
        "The Japanese animation is beautiful, and the script adaptation for the English-speaking audience is well-paced, clever, and absorbing enough to keep parents from squirming.\n",
        "Spending 95 minutes with the slight antics of Pikachu, Ash and the gang may seem like an eternity.\n",
        "A shameless plug for Pokemon merchandise? You betcha.\n",
        "70 minutes of irritation.\n",
        "It makes the Star Wars mythos play like Pong.\n",
        "A lot has been written about the admirable lessons that Pokemon teaches children about responsibility, teamwork and obedience. But some unfortunate messages are being sent as well.\n",
        "Strictly a kids' movie.\n",
        "Pokemon isn't even good animation, unless the standard of measure is the crude LCD graphics of a Game Boy.\n",
        "There isn't a moment of wonder or poetry in its very long 69 minutes.\n",
        "This pacifist spirit of brotherhood echoes the heroics in Princess Mononoke and other anime titles, but the artistic gap between the Miyazaki masterpiece and this project is huge.\n",
        "Likeluy divide critics and viewers, this is a simpler and less layered film than other works from Egoyan, who seems unable to infuse the pyschological thriller with his characteristic humor and irony.\n",
        "If it had a livelier pace and more believable acting by secondary characters ... Where's Marlowe? would be a big treat for audiences seeking a hip comedy.\n",
        "Vacant yet convoluted.\n",
        "Where's Marlowe? was expanded from a TV pilot produced for ABC. Small wonder it never found its way on the air.\n",
        "The film offers no message, no solutions, only a great time at the movies.\n",
        "Director Alan Parker's story of a band of young Dubliners playing American '60s soul is fresh, well-executed and original.\n",
        "This is probably Alan Parker's best film, in part because it's one of his most modest.\n",
        "Foul-mouthed, fast-talking and very funny, this is Parker's best to date.\n",
        "Mr. Parker is capable of whipping a series of quick, well-edited snippets into a happy collage of musical high spirits.\n",
        "Parker keeps going for the glitz. He may have shot The Commitments in Ireland, but his soul never left Hollywood.\n",
        "As music and human comedy, it works just fine.\n",
        "The musical numbers, actually performed by the on-screen band, are sensational.\n",
        "Alan Parker's sexy, hilarious, exuberantly energetic new film, The Commitments, has so much rhythmic juice that it's nearly impossible to stay in your seat.\n",
        "Crosby's easy, casual banter is just the right foil for Astaire's precision acrobatics, his wry, offbeat humor.\n",
        "Loaded with a wealth of songs, it's meaty, not too kaleidoscopic and yet closely knit for a compact 100 minutes of tiptop filmusical entertainment.\n",
        "Holiday Inn offers a reason for celebration not printed in red ink on the calendar.\n",
        "The Irving Berlin score, including 'Easter Parade' and 'Let's Say It with Firecrackers' (which gives Fred his best moment) makes up for the thin story.\n",
        "Unfortunate thesps take it all very seriously, while technical aspects are emptily polished.\n",
        "Drew Barrymore stars in a melodrama that borders on high-class kiddie porn.\n",
        "Its willingness to take risks, and its insights into the frailties and confusions of teenage friendships, lift the film right out of the rut.\n",
        "Why settle for the usual walk around the exploitation block when Shea offers a wild ride with the top down into uncharted territory?\n",
        "For the most part the actors' work seems incomplete because their characters are cut off before they can fully blossom.\n",
        "There is scarcely a moment in the movie when the story works as fiction; I was always aware of the casting, of the mood-setting devices, of the stylistic borrowings from Hitchcock.\n",
        "There are many fine performances and sensitive moral issues contained in The Verdict but somehow that isn't enough to make it the compelling film it should be.\n",
        "Sidney Lumet's direction, like David Mamet's patchy script, may not be quite good enough to justify the Rembrandt-like cinematography of Edward Pisoni and the brooding mood of self-importance, but it's good direction nonetheless.\n",
        "The first courtroom drama in years to recapture the brilliance of the form.\n",
        "The performances, the dialogue and the plot all work together like a rare machine.\n",
        "The talents of everyone connected with it are unmistakable, including those of Mr. Newman... It's just that the basic material calls for a kind of second-rate bravura performance from everyone, from the production designer to the actors.\n",
        "Sentimental without really being tender, naturalistic without being real.\n",
        "Newman and Woodward's daughter Potts steals the movie, but what makes it so watchable is Newman's reluctance to sentimentalise.\n",
        "Producer-director Paul Newman has made his finest behind-the-camera film to date in the screen version of Paul Zindel's play.\n",
        "Joanne Woodward's performance is not like anything she's ever done before.\n",
        "A state-of-the-art spaceship flying at the speed of light without narrative coordinates, Buckaroo Banzai is the very oddest good movie in many a full moon.\n",
        "Richter's comic genre hybrid comes complete with its own mythology, and team of established superheroes, and is curiously appealing.\n",
        "It violates every rule of storytelling and narrative structure in creating a self-contained world of its own.\n",
        "The film gives you the mildly annoying sensation of being left out of a not very good private joke.\n",
        "Buckaroo Banzai may well turn out to be a pilot film for other theatrical features, though this one would be hard to top for pure, nutty fun.\n",
        "You will not easily forget this incredibly robust family.\n",
        "An American movie with foreign-film sensibilities, Moonstruck's depths come from their perfect balance of writing and direction.\n",
        "It isn't great art -- it`s too closely concentrated on immediate emotional effect for that -- but it is highly sophisticated craftsmanship.\n",
        "There's an old-fashioned romanticism about the picture, a sweet, gentle approach to love and family life. But this is kept from seeming sappy by the picture's tough-minded, almost abrasive sense of humor.\n",
        "Charming if erratic, Moonstruck is the unlikely marriage of undershirt-in- kitchen naturalism and urbane drawing-room farce.\n",
        "Norman Jewison's tiramisu-sweet romantic comedy is passionate and profound.\n",
        "John Patrick Shanley's witty, shapely script puts an octet of New Yorkers under a lunar-tuney spell one romantic night. Cher shines brightest of all.\n",
        "Norman Jewison's film is a mostly appetizing blend of comedy and drama carried by snappy dialog and a wonderful ensemble full of familiar faces.\n",
        "Most of the show belongs to Cher and Cage, both of whom are at their energetic best.\n",
        "Stronger on mores than amore, a half smile for a summer night.\n",
        "The title refers to one relative's theory that the full moon can make people wildly romantic, make them behave in wonderful, unpredictably crazy ways. Not crazy enough.\n",
        "They're an irresistibly offbeat couple -- Cage playing on the edge, where he likes it; Cher creating a fairy-tale realist, captivating yet cautious.\n",
        "Reviews of the movie tend to make it sound like a madcap ethnic comedy, and that it is. But there is something more here, a certain bittersweet yearning that comes across as ineffably romantic, and a certain magical quality.\n",
        "Director Sydney Pollack has given a skilled, observant mounting as he carefully allows the man to grow in experience and knowhow.\n",
        "A flawed but immensely appealing film.\n",
        "There are momoments of great beauty and terror and deeply earned pathos. There are as well such not-so-incidental pleasures as John Rubinstein's lovely and serviceable musical score, and a cast of excellent supporting actors.\n",
        "Roman Polanski's first English-language film is still a creepy little horror masterpiece.\n",
        "At second glance, or as often as a moviegoer can bear to peek through his knotted fingers, it is a Gothic horror story, a classic chiller of the Psycho school and approximately twice as persuasive.\n",
        "Roman Polanski's first film in English is still his scariest and most disturbing.\n",
        "Deneuve, without much dialog, handles a very difficult chore with insight and tact.\n",
        "The ordeal we and Polanski craved for Deneuve turned out to be just a sport, and we were the ball -- just as we'd hoped.\n",
        "Still perhaps Polanski's most perfectly realised film, a stunning portrait of the disintegration, mental and emotional, of a shy young Belgian girl (Deneuve) living in London.\n",
        "Prepare yourself to be demolished when you go to see it -- and go you must, because it's one of those films everybody will soon be buzzing about.\n",
        "Repulsion is a frightening, fiercely entertaining experience that holds up to time.\n",
        "A good example of how a movie can be utterly characteristic of its maker and still fall with a resounding thud...\n",
        "Wilder's soft-centred cynicism provides frequent enough laughs without too many longueurs.\n",
        "Mr. Lemmon is little short of brilliant...\n",
        "Their largely negative or only superficially positive responses make me feel guilty about finding the series so fascinating -- and should make the filmmakers feel even guiltier.\n",
        "On some level, 42 Up is a startling home-movie time capsule. Simply to behold the aging process with such intimacy is enough to give you a shudder.\n",
        "One of the best movie series ever is a true-life drama like no other. Miss it at your peril.\n",
        "As beneficial as helmer's influence may be to that aging franchise, his work here reps a fascinating use of the docu form.\n",
        "The grand, class-society-embracing conception of this film has become too rich for its narrow stylistic confines.\n",
        "This series should be sealed in a time capsule. It is on my list of the 10 greatest films of all time, and is a noble use of the medium.\n",
        "There's something incredibly simple yet profound about what Apted has done with this series. It's an amazing achievement - not only is it a sociological masterpiece, but it's a fine example of how real-life drama can often be more compelling than fiction.\n",
        "At its best, the Up series does what art is meant to do: It binds us to others, helps us to identify our feelings and reminds us of our shared humanity.\n",
        "When this hugely ambitious project began, it was a longitudinal study of class divisions among English schoolchildren. But time and persistence have turned it into much more.\n",
        "A bit slower and heavier, but its connection of past and present yields more subtle character twists and contradictions than ever before.\n",
        "Touching and frequently hilarious.\n",
        "A grand slam!\n",
        "Offers a deeper immersion in that old '50s feeling than any other Hollywood film in recent memory.\n",
        "If more people followed Barry Levinson's example and made art after taking issue with something I've written, Hollywood and my mailbox would both benefit.\n",
        "Only the dourest dyspeptics will fail to enjoy it.\n",
        "A pleasant and worthy addition to a strong series of films.\n",
        "Delivers the emotional goods.\n",
        "While this version plays somewhat fast and loose with the original story, and even more so with the heroine's character, it is still much more Jane Austen than not.\n",
        "Despite its brazen politics, Mansfield Park never goes giddily amok as promised.\n",
        "This Mansfield Park becomes a kind of romanticized gloss -- an imaginative grad-student thesis that melds author and character.\n",
        "A witty, entertaining film.\n",
        "A gorgeous, enchanting experience.\n",
        "It's alluring to see a costume drama that takes us inside the subtlest, most wrenching realities of money.\n",
        "Patricia Rozema's Mansfield Park continues Jane Austen's winning streak on film.\n",
        "Ms. Rozema has made a film whose satiric bite is sharper than that of the usual high-toned romantic costume drama.\n",
        "Even if you have never read Austen, you will sense that something is wrong here long before a nude scene that would have made the author hide under a table.\n",
        "Though it's never dull, this Mansfield Park has too much of its own agenda and too little of Austen's to completely succeed.\n",
        "Mansfield Park is quick and funny, and a refreshing break from period-film stuffiness.\n",
        "Too often steps out of its era to adopt a knowing, politically correct, late-20th-century attitude to the society portrayed.\n",
        "A fine addition to the filmed Austen canon.\n",
        "Full of sparkling dialogue, witty asides, and top-drawer performances, Mansfield Park is a social satire wrapped inside a romantic comedy.\n",
        "Spins the most interesting modern re-interpretation of the Austen canon.\n",
        "It brims with life.\n",
        "It's a lovely work.\n",
        "An emotionally satisfying and brilliantly played take on the ups and (mostly) downs of a group of less-than-typical female friends.\n",
        "For me it felt like a good many weeks at a politically correct summer camp.\n",
        "All About My Mother, for all its self-deconstruction, is played with more sobriety and conviction than any of Mr. Almodovar's previous films.\n",
        "It displays a depth and maturity lacking in Almodovar's earlier work.\n",
        "Almodovar has called his near-unique creations 'screwball drama.' This finds him working at his best.\n",
        "This self-styled 'screwball melodrama,' a dance of grief, comedy, coincidence and resilience -- has a genuine emotional impact unlike anything Almodovar has done before.\n",
        "Almodovar knows how to tug on the heartstrings, and his filmmaking skills are well-displayed. Nonetheless, some fans might come away disappointed.\n",
        "Gay filmmakers like Almodovar may be providing a last refuge for decent parts for women, and for wholehearted melodrama in our hyperironic age.\n",
        "A dedication to great women performers.\n",
        "A surprisingly satisfying combination of bawdy sexual humor, genuine emotion and a plot with mechanics so excessive that Almodovar himself calls it 'a screwball drama.'\n",
        "Funny, provocative and deeply sympathetic in its wide embrace of women and those who would be women, All About My Mother is a beacon of a film.\n",
        "One of the best films of the Spanish director, whose films present a Tennessee Williams sensibility in the visual style of a 1950s Universal-International tearjerker.\n",
        "Few melodramas with such tragic underpinnings have ever made me feel so intensely happy.\n",
        "This is Almodovar's best film in a long while.\n",
        "All About My Mother is the achieved synthesis of the whole Almodovariety show, a new genre -- part farce, part weepie, low camp and high melodrama, caustic yet heartwarming, humanist and programmatically gender-blurring.\n",
        "Often deeply ludicrous, it's just as often deeply moving.\n",
        "Nimble dialogue, a brace of insightful moments and a slightly chocolate-box view of our city, lend 'Last Chance Harvey' a warmth and wisdom which outshine the more timeworn elements of the screenplay.\n",
        "All this gloomy masochism is made palatable because of the performers. And yet we must ask: Is this any way to show off two of our finest actors?\n",
        "These two actors are so strong that in the end we are left with a sweet and a tender movie.\n",
        "Sure, it's predictable at times, and maybe even a little sappy, but overall it's a sweet movie about genuine human emotion.\n",
        "Watching Hoffman and Thompson tentatively discover each other is joyously tender.\n",
        "What's in it for Emma? And the answer is ... not much.\n",
        "Though the story doesn't quite live up to the cast's pedigree, it at least provides the rare pleasure of a blossoming romance between two people older than Kate Hudson or Ryan Reynolds.\n",
        "Just about everything works in this small and surprisingly hopeful film, with beautifully attenuated performances by Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, who slip into the characters Hopkins has sewn for them like an old sweater.\n",
        "You can't take a script flimsy enough for a Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey vehicle and expect a couple of real thoroughbreds like Thompson and Hoffman not to shred it to pieces.\n",
        "A lightweight romance for the senior crowd, Last Chance Harvey does nothing in particular, but it does it fairly well thanks to stars Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.\n",
        "Writer-director Joel Hopkins resorts to a fair amount of contrivance to stress their sadness, and the story dutifully follows the standard boy-meets-girl arc, though in this case the boy is a little too old to be chasing women around airports.\n",
        "There are moments to treasure, but they're small and delicately crafted -- actors' moments.\n",
        "There's not a believable minute in the 92 minutes of Last Chance Harvey, but Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson smooth over most of the problems just by showing up and doing what they do for a living.\n",
        "Sort of a Before Sunrise for the sunset years, this quiet romantic comedy takes a cinematic chestnut and somehow infuses it with a sense of rue and regret that makes it seem new.\n",
        "Sappy, sentimental and redeemed only by the quiet radiance and fidgety intelligence of its leads, Last Chance Harvey is a fantasy about mopey middle-agers getting a second chance at love.\n",
        "Last Chance Harvey is a tremendously appealing love story surrounded by a movie not worthy of it.\n",
        "[Hoffman and Thompson's] talent and experience allow them to make Last Chance Harvey more than it might have been.\n",
        "This is as tepid as two-hours-in-the-cup old tea.\n",
        "The work of screenwriter Cesare Zavattini, director Vittorio De Sica, the nonprofessional actors, and many others is so charged with a common purpose that there's no point in even trying to separate their achievements.\n",
        "Undeniably the most important neorealist film after Rossellini's Open City.\n",
        "De Sica carefully balances a generally tragic sensibility with a quiet undercurrent of hope, all the while sucking us into the story with the sheer urgency of the search for a stolen bicycle.\n",
        "The picture is a pure exercise in directorial virtuosity.\n",
        "This film manages to appeal to the better angels of our nature in a way that only deepens as we grow older along with the film.\n",
        "It's a title you simply must watch, not necessarily for the truths it packs but rather for the bombed-out buildings of postwar Italy, peripheral details that director Vittorio De Sica insisted on.\n",
        "De Sica's neo-realist lodestone may have retained its vitality over the decades, but whatever sense of anger it whipped up in the disgruntled masses of postwar Rome feels lost to the excessively syrupy score.\n",
        "Again the Italians have sent us a brilliant and devastating film in Vittorio De Sica's rueful drama of modern city life, The Bicycle Thief.\n",
        "Simplicity is at the heart of The Bicycle Thief, as it is with so many films that endure.\n",
        "The Bicycle Thief is so well-entrenched as an official masterpiece that it is a little startling to visit it again after many years and realize that it is still alive and has strength and freshness.\n",
        "The Bicycle Thief is one of those wonderful titles whose power does not sink in until the film is over.\n",
        "Scarcely a story found in the street, The Bicycle Thief is an allegory at once timeless and topical.\n",
        "In the rich umbers of Haskell Wexler's cinematography, Matewan does look great.\n",
        "If Sayles's bite were as lethal as his bark, he might have given this a harder edge and a stronger conclusion. But the performances are uniformly fine.\n",
        "In its grave clarity, it's as pure and plaintive as a mountain ballad.\n",
        "Sayles must have meant his movie to stir and provoke, but the self-contained look of it yields something else -- a sense of quaintness, of harmless nostalgia.\n",
        "When this movie stumbles, it stumbles honestly and sympathetically, but, when it succeeds, it makes history sing.\n",
        "The movie works the way Westerns have always worked: In clear, simple terms and with straightforward dramatic devices.\n",
        "Matewan is a heartfelt, straight-ahead tale of labor organizing in the coal mines of West Virginia in 1920 that runs its course like a train coming down the track.\n",
        "The result is witty, astute, and finally very moving.\n",
        "Mr. Sayles's screenplay goes back to Shakespearean fundamentals... I suspect, however, that this seeming artlessness is a conscious choice. It's another example of the long-lost innocence that Matewan bravely celebrates.\n",
        "Riddled with labor rhetoric, this coal-dusted tragedy wavers between well-acted propaganda and historical burlesque.\n",
        "Add uniformly good acting to Sayles' script of dark coal pits, West Virginia spirit and cowboyish melodrama and you have stirring cinema.\n",
        "A period story about a small northwest mountain village where stars Warren Beatty and Julie Christie run the bordello, the production suffers from overlength; also a serious effort at moody photography which backfires into pretentiousness.\n",
        "Still Robert Altman's best moment, this 1971 antiwestern murmurs softly of love, death, and capitalism.\n",
        "A pioneering film, in both senses of the word, and one of the key works in the American cinema of the 1970s.\n",
        "I don't automatically object to contemporary allusions, but I prefer to find them myself, and McCabe and Mrs. Miller is so busy pointing them out to us that the effect is to undercut its narrative drive and the dignity of its fiction.\n",
        "The movie haunts you like a ballad whose tune you remember but whose words hang just beyond reach. And like listening to a ballad, we know the outcome of the events we're watching was foretold long ago, but we're helpless to do anything but surrender.\n",
        "Robert Altman has made a dozen films that can be called great in one way or another, but one of them is perfect, and that one is McCabe & Mrs. Miller.\n",
        "Movies will probably go on improving and broadening themselves; but in any event, The Grapes of Wrath is the most mature picture story that has ever been made, in feeling, in purpose, and in the use of the medium.\n",
        "Ford's admirers have rightly tended to play this down in favor of his later and more personal westerns, but there's much to admire here in Gregg Toland's sun-beaten photography and Henry Fonda's meticulous performance.\n",
        "The Grapes of Wrath is possibly the best picture ever made from a so-so book.\n",
        "It is an absorbing, tense melodrama, starkly realistic, and loaded with social and political fireworks.\n",
        "Captures the stark plainness of the migrants, stripped to a few possessions, left with innumerable relations and little hope.\n",
        "The Grapes of Wrath is just about as good as any picture has a right to be; if it were any better, we just wouldn't believe our eyes.\n",
        "The Grapes of Wrath was often named the greatest American film, until it was dethroned by the re-release of Citizen Kane.\n",
        "As the plot has as many complications as characters, much of the fun comes in watching Scripter Samson Raphaelson neatly tangle and untangle them without tying himself in a hard knot.\n",
        "Although picture carries the indelible stamp of Ernst Lubitsch at his best in generating humor and human interest from what might appear to be unimportant situations, it carries further to impress via the outstanding characterizations by Margaret Sullavan\n",
        "This 1940 film is one of Ernst Lubitsch's finest and most enduring works, a romantic comedy of dazzling range.\n",
        "Thoroughly different from To Be or Not To Be but just as exhilarating, it's one of the few films truly justifying Lubitsch's reputation for a 'touch.'\n",
        "...a pretty kettle of bubbling brew it makes under Mr. Lubitsch's deft and tender management and with a genial company to play it gently, well this side of farce and well that side of utter seriousness.\n",
        "Being a baseball fan involves repeatedly experiencing exquisite pain and exquisite joy. Well, there's a lot of both in The Natural.\n",
        "Levinson must have felt he had to swing for the fences. He can be forgiven for choking up with all The Natural's fans looking on dubiously. In fairness, the official scorer must credit him with a single. And Redford with an RBI.\n",
        "The Natural is an impeccably made, but quite strange, fable about success and failure in America.\n",
        "I've just about had it with directors who use the mythic mode as an alibi for unshaded characterizations, simpleminded plotting, and swells of artificial emotionality.\n",
        "Let yourself go and be rewarded by the sight of a hero running home to victory through clouds of fire.\n",
        "The message is: Baseball is purely and simply a matter of divine intervention. At about the 130-minute mark, I got the idea that God's only begotten son was playing right field for the New York team.\n",
        "Though entertaining in short stretches, The Natural has no recognizable character of its own.\n",
        "Arguably the best baseball movie ever made.\n",
        "There's a self-awareness to Shampoo that gives the movie a cleansing sadness and, oddly, makes Beatty an affectingly amoral roue.\n",
        "Shampoo, made in 1975 but set in 1968, the night before Richard Nixon's election to the presidency, was directed by Hal Ashby and written by Robert Towne and Warren Beatty, who may have produced one of the best scripts in the last three decades.\n",
        "All the excellent creative components do not add up to a whole.\n",
        "The laughs are tempered by bleakness and the film ends up saddened by its characters' waywardness.\n",
        "Disappointment comes in all weights and flavors, but the brand that's generated by Hal Ashby's Shampoo is a bit harder to swallow than some.\n",
        "Shampoo never quite connects its images of national mediocrity and personal self-deception.\n",
        "This 1975 feature is slick and often funny, but the smugness of the satire and the stunted emotions are finally wearying.\n",
        "A skilled, careful adaptation of a much-admired story.\n",
        "This may work for you if you settle at the outset for a nostalgic, all-American mood piece.\n",
        "Leave your preconceptions about fishing at the door: you'll be caught hook, line and sinker.\n",
        "Here are two things I never thought I'd say: I like a movie about fly fishing, and Robert Redford has directed one of the most ambitious, accomplished films of the year.\n",
        "Redford's movie is too little show and too much tell.\n",
        "In its determination to emphasize character and thoughtful content over formulas and facile sensationalism, it's a movie that's proudly out of step with Hollywood trends.\n",
        "Redford and his writer, Richard Friedenberg, understand that most of the events in any life are accidential or arbitrary, especially the crucial ones, and we can exercise little conscious control over our destinies.\n",
        "This has the feel of something genuine: sweet, touching, and sentimental.\n",
        "It doesn't hurt matters that the story's set in one of the world's most beautiful corners -- rendered in pre-twilight glows by cinematographer Philippe Rousselot.\n",
        "Under the direction of Adrian Lyne, most of the picture's situations seem like randomly chosen place holders, flat events that just fill time until the final bizarre confrontation.\n",
        "[The film brings] horror home to a place where the grownup moviegoer actually lives.\n",
        "The screws are tightened expertly in this suspenseful meller about a flipped-out femme who makes life hell for the married man who scorns her.\n",
        "While billed as a romance and a thriller, the film strictly qualifies as neither, appealing to our prurience, guilt, hatred, and dread.\n",
        "A predictable dog's dinner of Pavlovian thriller cliches, this will appeal strongly to those who think women should be kept on a short lead.\n",
        "Years hence, it will be possible to pinpoint the exact moment that produced Fatal Attraction, Adrian Lyne's new romantic thriller, and the precise circumstances that made it a hit.\n",
        "Close should take pride in her performance. She should also expect a depressing avalanche of scripts requiring a she-wacko.\n",
        "Fatal Attraction has an inescapable pull to it; it's suffocatingly exciting.\n",
        "Because the good things in the movie -- including the performances -- are so very good, it's a shame that the film's potential for greatness was so blatantly compromised.\n",
        "The biggest fault of Jagged Edge is that whatever suspense it manages to generate in its climactic scenes is achieved artificially, through tricky editing and manipulative ''danger'' music.\n",
        "A well-crafted, hardboiled mystery.\n",
        "The wholesome cast completely obliterates the unstated perversities that have been this genre's reason for being.\n",
        "These days it is almost unheard of for a movie to keep you guessing until the last frame, but this one does, partly because Marquand plays it so beautifully straight.\n",
        "The screenplay, by Joe Eszterhas, does what it can to throw up a smokescreen, but the audience will probably be well ahead of the story's final resolution.\n",
        "Supremely effective.\n",
        "Like many entries into the genre, Jagged Edge works best when it's watched with a minimum of analysis.\n",
        "The elements are in place but they don't add up to great drama in this well-meant effort to personalize the plight of illiterate people.\n",
        "The ending, despite good intentions, is American cinema at its tackiest and most hollow.\n",
        "It's as honest and direct and entertaining as the considerable talents of everyone involved can make it.\n",
        "Here, in a movie less animated than a barrel of tree sloths, Ritt encourages stale performances and a pace as dull as more tree sloths.\n",
        "McAlpine may be the movie's smartest contributor. He alone seems to realize that this pedantic project will soon be graduating into home-video or classroom use.\n",
        "Who said movies always have to be original? This one is redeemed by execution and brilliant talent: De Niro, Grodin, director Martin Brest, composer Danny Elfman, most of the cast and technicians.\n",
        "A performance like De Niro's, in a well-made entertainment like Midnight Run, is cheap at any price. And capable of restoring the audience's faith in the form.\n",
        "De Niro is nervily hilarious and Grodin nervelessly exceptional in Midnight Run, a formula buddy movie exalted to insta-classic status by their performances.\n",
        "Grodin and De Niro are different kinds of actors, but they share a knack for detail and a gift for understatement that keeps their scenes together crackling.\n",
        "Midnight Run touches on one of the great mysteries of the movies: How is it that the tritest material can come to life when touched by the right director and the right actors?\n",
        "Funny, unpredictable and refreshingly adult.\n",
        "The result is one of the most entertaining, best executed, original road pictures ever.\n",
        "That old formula, handcuffed captor and captive who become buddies on the run, gets an injection of new life from the playing of the cast.\n",
        "Mr. De Niro and Mr. Grodin are lunatic delights, which is somewhat more than can be said for the movie, whose mechanics keep getting in the way of the performances.\n",
        "Much as he might try, Brest can't masquerade this mainstream Hollywood studio picture as an offbeat little character piece.\n",
        "Whoever cast De Niro and Grodin must have had a sixth sense for the chemistry they would have; they work together so smoothly, and with such an evident sense of fun, that even their silences are intriguing.\n",
        "Brest propels the drama forward with planes, trains and automobiles (helicopters, too), but also makes time for De Niro, Grodin, and an excellent supporting cast, to make the frenetic ride well worth the trip.\n",
        "Miraculously, De Niro and Grodin turn this sow's ear into a plausible vehicle for a buddy movie, and thanks to both of them, this movie springs to life.\n",
        "Backdraft has some of the raw filmmaking excitement that has been missing from Howard's recent work.\n",
        "Visually, pic often is exhilarating, but it's shapeless and dragged down by corny, melodramatic characters and situations.\n",
        "Visually speaking, the film does pretty well with fire-as-spectacle, less well with everything else (Howard tends to trot out fuzzy-toned Spielbergian backlighting on any pretext).\n",
        "The fire sequences are stunning, and the build-up to them, complete with blaring sirens and bellowed conversations, has an aggressive immediacy.\n",
        "The spectacular fire sequences, which must have been hellish to film, are powerfully enveloping on screen, thanks especially to the eerie effect of the title.\n",
        "Backdraft is sure to do for fire what The Poseidon Adventure did for water.\n",
        "[The scenes involving fire] are so good they make me recommend the movie anyway, despite its brain-damaged screenplay.\n",
        "Director Howard is so mesmerized by the flames, he squirts formulaic lighter fluid over everything.\n",
        "Visually impressive, frequently pretentious, and extremely fluid as narrative (the 137 minutes sail by effortlessly), this mythic comedy-drama presents Gilliam as half seer, half snake-oil salesman and defies you to sort out which is which.\n",
        "The Fisher King has two actors at the top of their form, and a compelling, well-directed and well-produced story.\n",
        "Working within the constraints of a big studio film has brought out Gilliam's best: he's become a true storyteller and a wonderful director of actors. This time he delights not only the eye but the soul.\n",
        "Scary, touching, often hilarious, this modern fairytale is surprisingly enchanting.\n",
        "For every wild ride through Manhattan by an imaginary Red Knight trailing billows of flame, there is a small, comic encounter in a more down-to-earth mode.\n",
        "So what if it's not perfect? It's magic.\n",
        "A modern epic that fuses myth with hard-edged reality, it's a one-of-a-kind, thoroughly engaging experience.\n",
        "The Fisher King is a disorganized, rambling and eccentric movie that contains some moments of truth, some moments of humor, and many moments of digression.\n",
        "Occasionally marred by contrivance and a crude internal logic that doesn't bear close scrutiny, 'Frozen River' works best as a knuckle-gnawing, blue-collar genre thriller.\n",
        "Frozen River let me forget I was watching a movie, something that didn't happen often in 2008.\n",
        "There are moments of poetry on display.\n",
        "It moves and it heals, finding hints of redemption in the jagged face of life.\n",
        "The miracle of filmmaker Courtney Hunt's tense, carefully understated debut is that it is made better by its few flights of fancy.\n",
        "Frozen River isn't just a good movie made by a woman; it's a good movie on anyone's terms, one of the year's best. To find hope beneath this ice, in this ugly terrain, is to dream big.\n",
        "Made with uncommon skill and assurance, the film never succumbs to rank sentimentality, but it manages to get at the nuances of human relationships.\n",
        "Frozen River, a story of abject desperation, feels so real and immediate that it plays almost like a documentary.\n",
        "We quickly sense that the director of this film has unusual perception, and that whatever the story and performances turn out to be, she will make the most of them.\n",
        "Frozen River does what too many independent American movies only pretend to do: Takes you to an unnoticed corner of our country and shows what it's like to actually live there.\n",
        "An impressive first feature by writer/director Courtney Hunt, Frozen River boasts considerable suspense-movie tension and a compelling emotional journey for its foreground characters.\n",
        "It's fair to say that Hunt's first full-length feature, though uneven at times, holds the promise of better things to come.\n",
        "An urgent and incomparably moving first feature from Courtney Hunt.\n",
        "Courtney Hunt's Frozen River is the first great film of the fall. It has great actors playing vivid characters in a setting that makes for a clash of cultures.\n",
        "Frozen River is one of those rare independent films that knows precisely what it intends, and what the meaning of the story is.\n",
        "What a beautiful and impressive job by first-time writer-director Courtney Hunt.\n",
        "All in all, Frozen River is gripping stuff.\n",
        "A Sundance hit that is both absorbing and bleak, Frozen River is anchored by powerful performances, believable scenarios and excellent writing.\n",
        "This is a debut feature, though you'd never know it from the filmmaker's commandingly confident style, or from the heartbreaking beauty -- heartbreaking, then heartmending -- of Melissa Leo's performance.\n",
        "You cannot help being stirred by the reach and depth, the constant rebuffs to sloppiness, of a strong ensemble.\n",
        "Though the dirt and grime in North Country are artfully applied, it's purely cosmetic and skin-deep.\n",
        "North Country does a good job in ratcheting up the tension and unfairness until the audience is brought to the breaking point.\n",
        "If there was ever any thought that perhaps Whale Rider was a fluke, North Country should erase all doubt.\n",
        "North Country delivers an emotional wallop and a couple of performances worthy of recognition come award time.\n",
        "She's [Caro] got a good story to tell (based, loosely, on a real-life case), and a marvelous cast to help her tell it.\n",
        "What gives North Country urgency is that it's about how a man comes to understand that it's bad for him and for his community to deny his daughter privileges and prerogatives he'd grant his son.\n",
        "Niki Caro, director of Whale Rider, has made a classic underdog-vs.-the-system story, rendered in the harsh blue-grays of a Minnesota winter.\n",
        "Theron's truly raw and impassioned performance as Josey - - can't save the film from its own gradually slowing pace and seriously compromised third act.\n",
        "In the end, the no-nonsense direction by Caro (the New Zealander who directed Whale Rider), the terrific actors and the pitiless visuals by the great Menges more than carry the day.\n",
        "It's a memorable and touching portrayal of a certain kind of woman who is vital and determined instead of neurotic and victimized.\n",
        "North Country may be a simplistic account of a hard-won battle, but it will have audiences cheering.\n",
        "Despite its serious subject matter, North Country is a crowd-pleaser at heart.\n",
        "There's nothing cool or dispassionate anywhere in this film. It radiates waves of heat.\n",
        "For all North Country's blockbuster elements, the film remains a curiously uninvolving affair.\n",
        "In overdoing the theatrics and hammering the cliches North Country does artistic injustice to its own important argument.\n",
        "North Country is in the tradition of workers-rights films like Norma Rae and Silkwood in that it sends its message through a convincing character whose temerity and courage are accompanied by less heroic baggage.\n",
        "If you can take North Country as a movie, not a news report, you'll find a moving work that explores sexual harassment with unusual candor.\n",
        "Places in the Heart is a loving, reflective homage to his hometown by writer-director Robert Benton.\n",
        "Much is unemphatic, but all of it carries the moving weight of conviction. And it ends on a healing grace-note which passeth all understanding.\n",
        "[Benton's] memories provide the material for a wonderful movie, and he has made it, but unfortunately he hasn't stopped at that. He has gone on to include too much.\n",
        "Out of the memories of his boyhood in Waxahachie, Tex., during the Great Depression, and within the unlikely tradition of the old-fashioned ''mortgage'' melodrama, Robert Benton has made one of the best films in years about growing up American.\n",
        "Displaying precisely the imagination that gave the world such epic achievements as The Star Chamber and The Relic, Hyams dusts off America's designated import and goes with Arnie Schwarzenegger his own self.\n",
        "End of Days keeps asking whether faith or force will save the human race, before hedging its bets and insisting on both. Neither will be enough to save relics like Hyams and Schwarzenegger from their long, affluent drift into irrelevance.\n",
        "The movie is frequently silly.\n",
        "Think of End of Days as Hollywood's own Y2K bug.\n",
        "This is of interest only to the hard core of Schwarzenegger's army.\n",
        "Days is a movie full of punches but no spark.\n",
        "End of Days is an overblown, overspectacular, oversold movie without an original idea in its head.\n",
        "Movies like this are particularly vulnerable to logic.\n",
        "As incoherent about its mysticism as it is about anything else.\n",
        "Full of sound and fury, signifying absolutely nothing, End of Days is the loudest and least of the year's end-of-the-world movies.\n",
        "Arnold Schwarzenegger's latest vehicle, End of Days, is such a witless, bombastic, by-the-numbers hunk of millennial hooey it made me nostalgic for Commando.\n",
        "A depressingly shabby excuse for a movie.\n",
        "Schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased, action lovers won't be bored, and the Catholic League will be angry. Everyone else will see End of Days for what it is: a deliciously bad motion picture.\n",
        "The movie is as bloodless as a cyborg, and it feels as if it has been assembled according to diagrams supplied by someone who studied every successful sci-fi action thriller and then multiplied the findings by 10.\n",
        "The acting is hammy, all the 666 Book of Revelations stuff has been worn out since The Omen, and the film never quite focuses on anything long enough to build up any pseudo-religious creeps.\n",
        "Drab and depressing.\n",
        "Many sins have been committed in the name of religion; End of Days ranks as the latest.\n",
        "The problem is that as heist movies go this is about as captivating as watching someone dodge a bus fare. Almost everything about the film is second-rate: the direction, the plotting, the intrusive modernist production design.\n",
        "For about 100 of its 108 minutes, this film treats the viewer to a stylish, suspenseful roller coaster peppered with all manner of ugly, money-grubbing corporate types.\n",
        "Screenwriter Edward Anderson drops the South African angle in favor of more conventional developments and has a hard time bringing this across the finish line without a number of implausibilities.\n",
        "The inspired pairing of Demi Moore and Michael Caine as a pair of thieves in the diamond-heist semi-caper movie Flawless goes a long way toward overcoming the film's slack, leisurely pacing.\n",
        "[It's got] some neat little twists and turns.\n",
        "Those of us who'll happily watch Caine in pretty much anything will find enough pleasures here.\n",
        "This is supposed to be a caper movie. Shouldn't it have a heroine who looks as if she could, you know, conceivably, caper?\n",
        "The plot contortions that very slowly unfold under Michael Radford's arthritic direction in Flawless are not much...entertaining.\n",
        "There is a nice sense of style, and appreciation for tense face-to-face confrontations among characters trying to ignore the temptations around them. It's sort of the opposite of the current robbery flick The Bank Job - all substance and no flash.\n",
        "A nicely made if slightly stodgy jewel heist flick that offers Michael Caine one more juicy, low-key role and Demi Moore another step back up the ladder to career revival.\n",
        "Flawless is a gimcrack, a genre exercise, yet it's a confidence game in the best sense of the phrase. [Director] Radford knows the rules - when to bend them, when to break them, and when to play by them. That's an increasingly rare skill.\n",
        "Flawless, directed with a fine eye by Michael Radford, is a diamond-heist thriller that will make you nostalgic for the smart, classy caper films of a certain era.\n",
        "Flawless is a fictional tale, but something in director Michael Radford's conscientious, methodical presentation gives it the feeling of true history. Watching it is like watching a historical dramatization of something that never really happened.\n",
        "Flawless is a mildly diverting period heist movie in which an odd couple conspire to loot an evil London diamond company, for which they both work.\n",
        "Flawless makes an entertainingly nostalgic journey to old Britain -- that black-and-white world we remember from long-ago Alfred Hitchcock and David Lean movies.\n",
        "For all its stodginess, however, Flawless is a reasonably good time, for one reason. The reason's name is Maurice Micklewhite, better known as Michael Caine.\n",
        "Flawless is the sort of movie that tends to get called 'enjoyably old-fashioned,' except that there's nothing enjoyable about it.\n",
        "Flawless more than compensates for its rough edges.\n",
        "Intermittently powerful, though not really engaging, this new Figgis version suffers from poor conception of Strindberg's noted play and mediocre acting by Saffron Burrows in the lead; as the servant, Peter Mulan is quite good.\n",
        "Lee appears to have been torn between making a character study and an action movie, so both elements get short shrift.\n",
        "The intriguing (if not always successful) result is an oddly contemplative picture about a horribly bellicose time.\n",
        "Ang Lee is amazing.\n",
        "A sublime contemplation of the American character at a particularly revealing time in our struggle to become a nation.\n",
        "Oddly distant and uninvolving for such a blazing subject.\n",
        "The film is less than the sum of its parts.\n",
        "Admirably expressive.\n",
        "Politically astute, visually breathtaking but emotionally inert.\n",
        "Given the flat performances and Schamus's overexplanatory script, Ride With the Devil has the feel of undergraduate costume drama.\n",
        "Lee and his team bring the period and place to life brilliantly, in its every frontier main street, homely speech pattern, and burnt gunpowder fog.\n",
        "Visually arresting but dramatically flat.\n",
        "A film that would inspire useful discussion in a history class, but for ordinary moviegoers, it's slow and forbidding.\n",
        "Unengaging!\n",
        "Even if this isn't the best Civil War film ever made, it's one of the most interesting and least dogmatic.\n",
        "From a technical perspective, Ride With the Devil is nearly perfect.\n",
        "The cast is attractive and proficient at handling the fancy dialogue the filmmakers offer up as period vernacular.\n",
        "An impressive cast energizes Lee's smartly balanced themes of innocence and treachery.\n",
        "At the center of the film is one of the year's best performances -- that of British actress Janet McTeer.\n",
        "Tumbleweeds is a breath of fresh air that busts the cliches of dysfunctional mother-daughter sagas.\n",
        "A deeply and disappointingly conventional picture masquerading as a free-spirited one.\n",
        "Tumbleweeds is most worthwhile for its mother-daughter scenes, which ring truer than those in Anywhere but Here.\n",
        "One of the most magical movie moments of the year.\n",
        "This smart, hardscrabble, very likable film has a heart and spirit all its own.\n",
        "Tumbleweeds is far from a slick Hollywood-style production. It's not encumbered, for one thing, by star power. There's no list of past hits, Oscar bids, parts gone wrong.\n",
        "The characters have been intriguing to know and easy to care about.\n",
        "Tumbleweeds impresses with its freshly considered action and total avoidance of the stale and routine.\n",
        "There is something so poignant and generous and sad in that dilemma that women all over may watch McTeer's performance and glimpse an essential truth in it.\n",
        "Tumbleweeds is one of those wonderful, deeply personal pictures that pop up every now and then to lift your spirits.\n",
        "Set in Dublin in 1967, this extremely old-fashioned melodrama, about the struggle of a young widow to support her large family, is a throwback to the woman's picture of yesteryear and barely a notch above TV-Movie-of-the Week.\n",
        "The elegance of Roger Pratt's camera and the handsome costuming create a tension between the stately surface world and the raw passion of the characters.\n",
        "Handsomely mounted, literate, emotionally sophisticated, The End of the Affair has everything a period romance should have.\n",
        "The characters are so unsympathetic, the adulterous love affair at the heart of the story so joyless, and the three main performances so mannered that it's hard to feel anything but disappointment and boredom.\n",
        "Guaranteed to be mistaken for a first-rate picture.\n",
        "For all its obvious psychoanalytic implications, [Jordan's] wacky romantic triangle lost me long before it crawled to its spiritualist conclusion.\n",
        "An effective love story that's intensely old-fashioned.\n",
        "The best and most graceful Greene adaptation since The Third Man.\n",
        "Tasteful and seductive.\n",
        "For two-thirds of The End of the Affair [Jordan] does an astonishing job of fusing his pop-magical temperament with Greene's astringency and wit.\n",
        "All sorts of questions go unanswered, and there's little of the density found in Campion's early work; this is mainly smoke, not fire.\n",
        "Original in every sense, this often difficult film about family, relationships, sexual politics, spiritual questing, faith and obsession further explores the director's abiding fascinations in excitingly unconventional terms.\n",
        "Ms. Winslet is, by contrast, champagne and caviar for moviegoing grown-ups with good taste.\n",
        "It's brave, adventurous, refreshingly frank -- qualities also marking the performances, particularly those of the leads.\n",
        "At once hilarious and serious, cruel and tender, and bristling with vitality, Holy Smoke is the right movie for the millennium, envisioning new possibilities in the way people view and relate to one another.\n",
        "Nice try, but there's not a laugh in sight.\n",
        "Despite the good performances and Campion's visual reach, her characters are too specific/eccentric to transcend their storyline and make us feel that there's something to be absorbed from the P.J.-Ruth imbroglio.\n",
        "It probably all looked good on paper, but the playing out is something else again.\n",
        "A dreadful mess.\n",
        "The film isn't really about cults at all, but about the struggle between men and women, and it's a little surprising, although not boring, when it turns from a mystic travelogue into a feminist parable.\n",
        "One other factor makes Holy Smoke! persuasive to watch: Campion's sheer pleasure in image-making.\n",
        "Filled with flashy sight gags, overwrought performances, and madly overlapping dialogue.\n",
        "Aimless and unfocused.\n",
        "This script -- to be kind -- is uneven at best and completely illogical at its worst.\n",
        "As Holy Smoke moves from its early mix of rapture and humor into this more serious, confrontational stage, it runs into trouble.\n",
        "Winslet is the sort of actress who can rage at the heavens and reach for them at the same time.\n",
        "Holy Smoke! owes a lot to Winslet, both because of the way she looks and because of the emotional energy she brings to her work. Without Winslet, the film would be barely worth watching.\n",
        "Holy Smoke is a demanding and often perverse picture. But its sense of itself is exhilarating.\n",
        "Holy Smoke is one of those movies that takes some potentially fascinating ideas and shipwrecks them by poor execution and even worse writing.\n",
        "Sigourney Weaver dominates with her powerful performance but the film, a feature debut from theater director Scott Elliott, is so poorly conceived and staged that much of the emotional impact gets lost\n",
        "That which does not kill us makes us ... well, still alive.\n",
        "May be too painful and downbeat for many moviegoers. But it redefines courage in acting.\n",
        "Good performances all through the movie.\n",
        "Worth navigating for its refusal to play to the crowd. There's certainly nothing safe or sweet about Weaver's performance.\n",
        "Provocative and very moving.\n",
        "Scott Elliott's palsied directorial debut, from a mine shaft-ridden script, is a sick joke.\n",
        "Acting and character development are uneven.\n",
        "A surprisingly gripping and moving experience.\n",
        "Defying every pitfall and eclipsing everything else in the film, Sigourney Weaver delivers a bravura portrait of a complex woman falsely accused of child abuse.\n",
        "Gives three first-rate actors a chance to stretch.\n",
        "Too many situations are set up or suggested without much follow-through.\n",
        "An accomplished film that continually takes us beyond our first impressions of people and situations.\n",
        "The film overflows with the studied ordinariness that prevails in Mom movies, where glamorous Hollywood stars muck about in pajamas and a little epiphany may be signaled by a broken cereal bowl on the kitchen floor.\n",
        "In this season of Oscar-bait overacting, I'm grateful that \"A Map of the World\" includes recognizable emotional landmass.\n",
        "Droll and amusing.\n",
        "A shallow portrait of the artist as a cad.\n",
        "There is enjoyment to be had from Sweet and Lowdown.\n",
        "Emmet Ray is a fictional character, but so convincing in Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown that he seems like a real chapter of jazz history we somehow overlooked.\n",
        "A snappy, loose-limbed performance from Penn.\n",
        "The movie has ample delights.\n",
        "An enjoyable diversion.\n",
        "The movie is so confused about where it wants to go, it suffers from the same identity crisis as its protagonist.\n",
        "This is one very tuneful labor of love.\n",
        "A likable, lively little ditty -- one theme, some clever variations -- that never wears out its welcome.\n",
        "The only reason to see this film is for the acting.\n",
        "Sweet and Lowdown is undeniably pleasant, but British actress Samantha Morton quietly explodes it: Her performance is like nothing I've seen in recent years.\n",
        "If you're interested in a faithful visual adaptation of Wolfe's novel, be assured that this isn't it.\n",
        "What a mess.\n",
        "On film, Bonfire achieves a consistency of ineptitude rare even in this era of over-inflated cinematic air bags.\n",
        "If you loved Wolfe's book, you may very well hate the movie. If you simply liked the novel, you may be simultaneously entertained and disappointed by what De Palma and Cristofer have done to it.\n",
        "Certainly Wolfe's canvas might lend itself to a broad approach, but broad like Dr. Strangelove, not broad like the Three Stooges.\n",
        "The film was cast wrong and written shallowly.\n",
        "One of the most indecently bad movies of the year.\n",
        "Brian De Palma's take on Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities is a misfire of inanities.\n",
        "If anything, it's a Hanks 'little boy lost' movie, more in the Big tradition than The Big Tradition.\n",
        "By being consistent, the novel transcends its own cynicism to become healthily skeptical. This is just what Brian De Palma's gross, unfunny movie adaptation does not do.\n",
        "A calamity of miscasting and commercial concessions.\n",
        "Those who have read the book will be constantly distracted because they know so much more than the movie tells them about the characters.\n",
        "If the strength of the novel was the interplay between Wolfe's dry-white reportage and the sensational, tabloid-tacky humorous events he wrote about, Vanities-the-movie just goes for the tacky jugular.\n",
        "It's among the most understated anti-war films ever made, effortlessly humanistic but far too subtle to indulge in preaching.\n",
        "A model of simplicity and grace, with emotional effects that move you when you least expect it, the kind of great film that only a master can pull off.\n",
        "Funny, heart-wrenching, nail-biting, caustic and profound, touting the futility of armed combat while turning imprisonment and escape into a microcosm for society's aspirations and contradictions.\n",
        "It's still one of the key humanist expressions to be found in movies: sad, funny, exalting, and glorious.\n",
        "It's an excellent film, with Renoir's usual looping line and deft shifts of tone, though today the balance of critical opinion has shifted in favor of the greater darkness and filigree of The Rules of the Game.\n",
        "An artistically masterful feature, the picture breathes the intimate life of warriors on both sides during the [First] World War.\n",
        "Renoir films have a way of talking about one thing while being about another.\n",
        "Renoir has created a strange and interesting film, but he owes much to his cast.\n",
        "I can't comment yet again on this magnificent work except to say that its account of French prisoners in German hands during World War I seems now even more soaringly elegiac.\n",
        "... the camera doesn't point or intrude, but glides.\n",
        "... Renoir, the grand humanist filmmaker, spoke for all that's best about people at a time when people were in danger of becoming their worst.\n",
        "Robbins is so convinced of his movie's political correctness that he couldn't see its lack of dramatic cohesion or luster.\n",
        "Knows how to get audiences clapping along.\n",
        "A confused, unrefined agitprop movie.\n",
        "As a mixture of drama, humor and history, a melange of seriousness and slapstick, real people and imagined characters, it definitely stands out.\n",
        "Willfully superficial.\n",
        "Remarkably complex, funny and thought-provoking.\n",
        "Marvelous, provocative entertainment.\n",
        "The comic blithely stumbles through the rude slapstick as if he thinks the movie's real lead will show at any second and allow him to sink gratefully into second-banana status again.\n",
        "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo is just another in a long line of failed post-Saturday Night Live efforts.\n",
        "If Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo were required to take a standardized test, its IQ would plot out lower than Jose Lima's ERA.\n",
        "Just saying the name of this movie makes you feel stupid.\n",
        "An inconsistently funny film that draws heavily and obviously on recent successful low-brow comedies like There's Something About Mary and Austin Powers.\n",
        "The jokes are unabashedly pitched at 12-year-old boys, with flatulence, masturbation and excretions as the leading themes.\n",
        "What in heaven's name were the geniuses at Disney thinking when they green-lighted this moronic, mean-spirited excuse for a comedy?\n",
        "Rob Schneider certainly has what it takes to play a doofy, soft-bodied poseur hustler, but this dim farce makes the mistake of setting him up with a series of tricks even lowlier and more pathetic than he is.\n",
        "How many more times are we going to have to sit through that feeble gag about the latex glove and the body cavity search?\n",
        "The story of a schmo who finds love by prostituting himself is actually funnier than it deserves to be, not to mention rather sweet in a sophomoric, manwhore - with - a - heart - of - gold kind of way.\n",
        "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo makes There's Something About Mary look like Masterpiece Theatre.\n",
        "A couple of these situations are funny, a few are real clunkers, and it all fades away like a slightly bad odor.\n",
        "The kind of picture those View n' Brew theaters were made for, as long as you don't View.\n",
        "The problem with Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo is the low level of its low humor.\n",
        "Utterly disposable.\n",
        "Much of the three-hour movie takes place in the prison, but the resonant characterization, expansive plotting, and judicious use of exterior locations and flashbacks turn the walls into windows.\n",
        "To more than a few viewers, this one will feel like a life sentence.\n",
        "The supernatural elements carry an undeniable emotional charge, but the solution to the underlying murder mystery is disappointingly tidy and trite.\n",
        "Three long hours of wind, an exercise in titanic self-importance intent on passing off klunky rhetoric as poignant drama.\n",
        "In its own old-fashioned way, Frank Darabont's style of picture making is well matched to King-size yarn spinning.\n",
        "The Green Mile often grabs, and generally holds, one's attention through the long journey.\n",
        "Consistently captivating.\n",
        "By taking the extra time, Darabont has made King's The Green Mile into a story which develops and unfolds, which has detail and space.\n",
        "The Green Mile resonates.\n",
        "A vivid, emotional story.\n",
        "Moves with the suffocating deliberateness of a river of molasses.\n",
        "The Green Mile effectively sideswipes the enduring hot political issues it raises to force viewers to a pro-Hanks position.\n",
        "Darabont works big but thinks small, or at least without great complexity.\n",
        "The Green Mile is more than an hour old before anything like a plot develops, and then it turns out to be such a sentimental-supernatural whopper that even Tom Hanks, usually the most casually credible of actors, is severely tested.\n",
        "An engrossing picture.\n",
        "The movie taps into a vein of Dickensian sentiment, nightmare and idealism, ribaldry and tragedy that give it that part-dark, part-shining fairytale quality that imbues most King tales and all three of Darabont's features.\n",
        "The Green Mile is simply a case of severe overreaching and the illusion that an overstuffed movie is an epic movie.\n",
        "An epic!\n",
        "A manipulative but absorbing and deeply satisfying adaptation of Stephen King's prison novel.\n",
        "The three-hour-plus film permits the kind of detailing that not only brings the storytelling to life, but sometimes persuades us we're breathing to its rhythms.\n",
        "Hallstrom's film could have used more dramatic muscle but is nonetheless a touching, old-fashioned charmer that ultimately satisfies.\n",
        "Mr. Irving remains a disturbingly facile spinner of yarns in which the most sordid facts of life are glossed over into comfortably didactic homilies about the innate goodness of people. Yet, I was somehow moved...\n",
        "Hallstrom's humanism is possibly a little low key and romantic given such tough themes as abortion and incest.\n",
        "[It] is a fable that turns into a 1940s New England variation on Charles Dickens. It is also one dickens of an American movie.\n",
        "It's not a story so much as a reverie about possible stories.\n",
        "A far better film than other film adaptations of Irving's work.\n",
        "The first screenplay Irving wrote from his own book, and the job suits him.\n",
        "Misses Irving's main gifts, despite his own best scriptwriting intentions.\n",
        "The Cider House Rules isn't one film at all. It's two films, only one of which is successful.\n",
        "Perceived as too soft by some and too weird and kinky by even more.\n",
        "The Cider House Rules pales by comparison with the gutsier, more full-bodied adaptation of Irving's The World According to Garp.\n",
        "A bit too still, and so predictable that some part of me kept saying I had read the book when memory told me I hadn't.\n",
        "Easily the finest film realization of an Irving novel.\n",
        "A deliberately old-fashioned picture that succeeds in nearly everything it tries to do.\n",
        "[Lasse Hallstrom] has a near-genius for unpatronizing tolerance, and for seeing beauty in the world and nature and seasons without turning them into postcards.\n",
        "Irving is lucky in his cast -- especially Caine and Lindo as the flawed father figures.\n",
        "Inappropriate for audiences of all ages.\n",
        "Douglas, always one of Hollywood's most vigorous actors, still commands the screen as Harry.\n",
        "Diamonds can be proud of its achievement as the ultimate primer on elderly embarrassments and the best ways to exploit them.\n",
        "Kirk Douglas is still the champ.\n",

        "It'll be hard not to check your watch every five minutes.\n",
        "'Oh God, now I've got brains spattered all over me,' exclaims The Punisher's slippery inside man, Detective Soap. You may feel the same at the end of this messy, sadistic reboot of the Marvel comic-book series.\n",
        "This was a terrible movie.\n",
        "Hopefully it's three strikes and you're out for The Punisher, as this latest attempt at creating another comic book franchise will prove once and for all that maybe this character just doesn't deserve the big screen treatment.\n",
        "At one point, the Punisher is asked who punishes him. The better question for those who made this inane bloodfest is: Why punish us?\n",
        "The ultraviolent third stab at Marvel's homicidal vigilante is the best and closest to the source material.\n",
        "Assuming you can appreciate the high level of gore and assorted sadistic weirdness, the action is satisfying and the dark story is close to the tone of its Marvel Comics source material.\n",
        "Punisher: War Zone is bad enough that it may remind viewers how lucky we have been this year to get two superior superhero movies in Iron Man and The Dark Knight.\n",
        "The acting is better than the script deserves and Lexi Alexander's cut-to-the-hearse direction lends the film considerable kick. But there is a steel spike at the end of Punisher's boot that will gouge your eyes out.\n",
        "With its dopey fight scenes, grimy look and goopy gore, this movie is so far from ept that inept is the wrong word. It's anti-ept.\n",
        "This is purely gutter, fanboy, Cheez Whiz cinema, but Alexander delivers the goods.\n",
        "Does it have to be so witless, so stupid, so openly contemptuous of the very audience ita(TM)s supposed to be pandering to?\n",
        "This is the third crack Hollywood has taken at the comic-book hero the Punisher. They say the third time's the charm. But then, they say a lot of things.\n",
        "This awful sequel dispenses with any such pretense, its cartoonish characters running an endless gauntlet of hypergruesome violence.\n",
        "If most of the budget has gone to ordnance and blood squibs, director Lexi Alexander films the sprays of gore with an artisan's eye, and the results make effective if morally indefensible movie red meat.\n",
        "Anyone with a modicum of good sense -- or a weak stomach -- will take it as a warning to stay the heck away from this literally and figuratively deadly War Zone.\n",
        "The film works a bit better than the 2004 Punisher installment, the one starring surly, dislikable Thomas Jane as Frank Castle.\n",
        "Marvel's latest chunk of comic-book pulp strikes the usual brooding poses, but the film is so utterly ridiculous -- make that bloody ridiculous -- that its self-induced giggle fits become downright hilarious.\n",
        "You used to be able to depend on a bad film being poorly made. No longer. The Punisher: War Zone is one of the best-made bad movies I've seen.\n",
        "Culturally it may be most noteworthy for its title arch-criminal, who influenced the creation of Batman.\n",
        "It's meant to make you feel sad for what's lost, but a vitality throbs through it.\n",
        "Director Peter Bogdanovich has seen Anarene, Texas, in the cinematic terms of 1951 -- the langorous dissolves, the strong chiaroscuro, the dialogue that starts with bickering and ends at confessional.\n",
        "Notre Dame professor Edward Fischer has said that 'the best films, like the best books, tell how it is to be human under certain circumstances'. Larry McMurtry did a beautiful job of this.\n",
        "It's all fairly calculated, though Bogdanovich knows how to cast actors and highlight character turns.\n",
        "Superb performances all round add to the charm of this fine, if now unfashionable film.\n",
        "The film is above all an evocation of mood. It is about a town with no reason to exist, and people with no reason to live there. The only hope is in transgression.\n",
        "Has the effect of a lovely, leisurely, horizontal pan-shot.\n",
        "Director Andy Tennant has outdone himself.\n",
        "Disappointing.\n",
        "Lush, beautifully shot, but quite draggy.\n",
        "Anna and the King is nothing but old-fashioned but it's old-fashioned in a glorious way.\n",
        "What it really lacks is dramatic juice.\n",
        "Tennant seems genuinely unsure what mood he's striving for here.\n",
        "Foster, I believe, sees right through this material and out the other side, and doesn't believe in a bit of it.\n",
        "The problem with Anna and the King is that it's caught halfway between then and now.\n",
        "Like too many movies, this one cannot bear to end quietly and gracefully.\n",
        "This may be the best and healthiest date movie of the season.\n",
        "Generally interesting and sometimes emotionally affecting.\n",
        "A misstep for the gifted Ms. Foster.\n",
        "The new movie offers old-fashioned kinds of pleasures.\n",
        "Holds its own against the beloved 1956 musical The King and I.\n",
        "A richly satisfying mix of history, drama and romance.\n",
        "Columbus lays on the sentimentality thickly, sometimes letting it get in the way of the storytelling. The longer the movie continues, the more overt he becomes in his emotional pandering.\n",
        "It's one thing to ask an audience to love a mechanical man, but quite another to love a mechanical performance.\n",
        "It's a bit strange, and strained.\n",
        "This tin man has a heart, but his movie needs a pulse.\n",
        "So coldly calculated it could give you frostbite.\n",
        "A cornball drone of greeting-card sentiment.\n",
        "By relegating the story to a disappointing level of superficiality and never attempting to venture more than skin-deep into some intriguing themes, Bicentennial Man comes across like recycled, diluted Star Trek.\n",
        "An underfunded inventor makes enough snide asides about 'relentlessly unfashionable android technology' that you half expect Williams to start speechifying about the merits of cloning.\n",
        "Canned emotions.\n",
        "Bicentennial Man has heart, but lacks bite.\n",
        "It's frequently witless and entirely lacks conviction.\n",
        "Part of the deep appeal of this film is its undercurrent of yearning beneath surface ironies.\n",
        "You wish that the film unfolded on a more modest scale and in the real world.\n",
        "[Robin William's] most grandiose holiday greeting yet.\n",
        "An ambitious tale handled in a dawdling, sentimental way.\n",
        "A male fantasy with artificial intelligence.\n",
        "Bicentennial Man's heart may be synthetic, but it beats strongly, nonetheless.\n",
        "A wonderful mess.\n",
        "What this film may have needed to get on its feet is some honest-to-goodness violence.\n",
        "One of the most enthralling and exhilarating American movies in ages.\n",
        "All the work is top-notch.\n",
        "You don't have to like everything [Anderson] does, but if you enjoy seeing the walls rattled and the roof raised in the Hollywood citadel, you've got to love it.\n",
        "You could spend three hours snickering at Anderson's 'What the World Needs Now Is Aimee Mann' metaphysic. But his vision cuts deeper than a lot of folky bathos.\n",
        "Magnolia makes it three-for-three for writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson\n",
        "It's an audacious, hilarious, deeply affecting three-hour tapestry.\n",
        "An impressive piece of work with some fine acting that makes holding our interest for three-plus hours seem easy.\n",
        "Those willing to wait will find ample reward here. Those who want and expect prompt gratification will find an invitation to walk out at some point during the first 90 minutes of the picture.\n",
        "Nearly as impressive as Anderson's rapport with his actors is his use of parallel action to juggle their performances.\n",
        "What leaves you breathless, though, is the knockout acting by the cast.\n",
        "I wish I could join in the chorus of praise...\n",
        "Sprawling mess of a film.\n",
        "The botanical implications are apt: Paul Thomas Anderson's big, showy flower of a movie unfurls brilliantly.\n",
        "The more you think about Magnolia -- the dry wit, the bravura staging, the intricate design, the wondrous performances -- the better and more unusual the film seems.\n",
        "Magnolia is the kind of film I instinctively respond to. Leave logic at the door. Do not expect subdued taste and restraint, but instead a kind of operatic ecstasy.\n",
        "Magnolia is Short Cuts with hope. It's my kind of mess.\n",
        "Unlike the flashy but hollow Boogie Nights or the studied tough-guy attitude of Hard Eight, Magnolia grounds its stylistic pyrotechnics with genuine emotion.\n",
        "Standout performances include those given by Waters, Reilly, and especially Tom Cruise, ferociously alive after sleepwalking through that Kubrick movie.\n",
        "Onegin is as pretty a picture as anyone could want of a Russian lit-flick ...\n",
        "The heart of Pushkin's celebrated classic pumps firm and full in debuting director Martha Fiennes' richly textured pic version.\n",
        "Even if grand pathos isn't achieved, Martha Fiennes makes a brave and welcome stab at it.\n",
        "There is a cool, mannered elegance to the picture that I like, but it's dead at its center.\n",
        "The film's only real flaw -- alas, a substantial one -- is that its pace is too deliberate and gets more deliberate as it goes along.\n",
        "Unable to capture either its wit, psychological acuity, or formal rigor, the movie essentially reduces the schematic, seesaw narrative to doomy cliches.\n",
        "Stone doesn't show up until the film is half over and seems to be trying rather hard to make up for the lost time.\n",
        "Warchus seems as at ease with the complexity of the style as he is with directing actors.\n",
        "Simpatico pulls up lame way before the stretch.\n",
        "Much effort and expertise have gone into the making of Simpatico, but, while it's entertaining, it's not as persuasive as it needs to be to succeed fully.\n",
        "Improbabilities and all, Simpatico still boasts wonderful scenes and a cast that is truly superb.\n",
        "It's a confounding and unsatisfying film.\n",
        "The movie is so careless about its horse-selling subplot that its melodramatic payoff feels cheap and abrupt.\n",
        "Simpatico never pulls together long enough to amount to much more than a series of prematurely aborted encounters, scenes from a movie sketched but unfinished.\n",
        "Warchus' accomplished handling and the stars' flavorful performances lend Simpatico a bittersweet grace.\n",
        "Another example of when bad movies happen to good actors.\n",
        "A movie hobbled by unwieldy visual ideas.\n",
        "It's a shame Nolte and Bridges weren't cast as brothers, because the two have similar rumpled-suede faces and irritated-bark delivery.\n",
        "Instead of permitting its characters to be developed naturally, Simpatico manipulates them to fulfill the needs of its heavy-handed plot.\n",
        "Although the central offense of the past is certainly sordid enough, it's not terribly interesting, and no laborious montage can alter that.\n",
        "[A] beautifully crafted and lively romp around the 1880s stage world.\n",
        "Leigh's cast are beyond compare, and the whole bighearted, splendidly droll celebration of the entertainer's lot surely stands among British cinema's one-of-a-kind treasures.\n",
        "If you are a Gilbert and Sullivan buff, you will be in heaven. If you are not, the first thing you will need to know is that the film is nearly three hours long.\n",
        "The film is a delight and a surprise, all the more so since Leigh is associated with gritty working-class stories.\n",
        "Not your normal period piece, to be sure.\n",
        "The year's least likely, most infectious tour de force.\n",
        "A hive of broad, brilliant performances.\n",
        "The performances cut deeper than usual for costume films, and the actors once again seem to literally become who they're playing.\n",
        "One of those films that create a mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities, much as Shakespeare in Love did last year.\n",
        "A consistently delightful, superbly timed, and impeccably staged wedge of British pop history.\n",
        "It is a well crafted and solidly entertaining effort that illustrates how expert filmmakers can expand their ranges while still producing movies that are worth seeing.\n",
        "A charming, warm, witty movie, funny one minute and moving the next.\n",
        "Despite its draining length, it proves to be even better and richer on a second viewing.\n",
        "Leigh's deft hand with actors and sharp eye for character detail are still very much in evidence.\n",
        "One of the year's best films.\n",
        "You're likely to be moved to tears.\n",
        "Though the film runs nearly three hours, it gets better as it goes along.\n",
        "There is a sense of real, very Mike Leighish, life in this film that darkens and transforms it. And transfixes us.\n",
        "A rather superficial and limited probe of American male sexual hypocrisies.\n",
        "The picture has its moments of chilling insight, though essentially it is one more quaint early-70s stab at an American art cinema that never materialized.\n",
        "This was never quite the major assault on sexism and male chauvinism it set itself up to be.\n",
        "Stays within the universe of its characters, and inhabits it totally. And within that universe, men and woman fail to find sexual and personal happiness because they can't break through their patterns of treating each other as objects.\n",
        "In addition to being the toughest comedy since Little Murders, and the most imaginative comedy since Catch 22, Carnal Knowledge represents a nearly ideal collaboration of directorial and writing talents.\n",
        "Fonda and Hopper, it should by this time go without saying, give immense performances.\n",
        "A film important to and influential in the flower-power late '60s, Easy Rider now seems like a narcissistic hodgepodge of travelogue and passion play.\n",
        "None of the forced violence, lawlessness, rapist, gratuitous speed aspects of the motorbike clan in this perceptive film.\n",
        "The film may be a relic now, but it is a fascinating souvenir -- particularly in its narcissism and fatalism -- of how the hippie movement thought of itself.\n",
        "[A] simplistic amalgam of travelogue and the zoom lens.\n",
        "Hopper, Fonda and their friends went out into America looking for a movie and found instead a small, pious statement (upper case) about our society (upper case), which is sick (upper case). It's pretty but lower case cinema.\n",
        "It plays today more as a period piece than as living cinema, but it captures so surely the tone and look of that moment in time.\n",
        "Almost three hours of this jitter deteriorates from bravura filmmaking to annoying mannerism, and Any Given Sunday ends up less than the sum of its many, often interesting parts.\n",
        "A meathead burlesque.\n",
        "Choc-a-bloc with manly blather about sacrifice and honour and rugged individuals pulling together for the greater glory of the team.\n",
        "Yes, it's that kind of a movie, and if you know what you're getting into, it's unlikely you'll be bored.\n",
        "One of the few football movies that really puts you in the action, conveying the ferocity and trauma of the game.\n",
        "Big, bold, brash and occasionally brilliant.\n",
        "A frequently entertaining, rah-rah look at pro football.\n",
        "Most interesting are images of dangerous play as the players themselves see it.\n",
        "Bombastic, overblown and -- despite its many flaws -- compelling entertainment.\n",
        "Stone never simply make a point when he can make it 50 times with a hammer to the forehead.\n",
        "Action largely undifferentiated.\n",
        "There's no shortage of color and vigor in this pumped-up movie.\n",
        "Probably the most predictable -- and blatantly commercial -- movie [Oliver Stone's] ever directed.\n",
        "We're reminded that very little movie material is original until actors transform it from cliches into particulars.\n",
        "Pretentious almost to the point of silliness.\n",
        "In the end the movie cops out.\n",
        "A visual concussion.\n",
        "Performances are almost all shot through with electricity.\n",
        "We're constantly kept guessing as to what's real or false. Intriguing.\n",
        "As drama, it's a near miss. Yet as an introduction -- or a reminder -- of a singular talent, it has its appeal.\n",
        "Superficially clever yet profoundly shallow.\n",
        "A strange trip but a far from satisfying one.\n",
        "What is most wonderful about Man on the Moon, a very good film, is that it remains true to Kaufman's stubborn vision.\n",
        "Amadeus with a twist.\n",
        "A brilliant, almost terrifying impersonation.\n",
        "All the audience is left with is the impression of a thoroughly obnoxious man you'd never want to meet in real life.\n",
        "The big problem with Man on the Moon is that it settles for being a thing of surfaces.\n",
        "Uninspired and relatively clueless.\n",
        "I figured that if anyone could make a flick about the even more objectionable Kaufman, these three were the guys for the job. I was wrong.\n",
        "A brilliant, maniacally funny, and dizzying experience.\n",
        "Ultimately disappoints because it doesn't share its subject's sense of the outrageous.\n",
        "One of the year's most entertaining movies.\n",
        "The filmmakers don't even attempt to give Kaufman an inner life.\n",
        "This is a movie that testifies in blisteringly persuasive terms to the intense, particular genius of Jim Carrey.\n",
        "The problem with this film is that the filmmakers want Kaufman to emerge as a kind of innocent while their biographical due diligence indicates that Kaufman was a head case.\n",
        "That's not a movie, it's a timeline.\n",
        "A formidable piece of work.\n",
        "Enormously underwritten and unfunny.\n",
        "Familiarity is the watchword of this overblown opus, which neglects holes in the plot to play up its postmodern theme of identity as pastiche -- a clear case of the pot calling the kettle black.\n",
        "On balance, The Talented Mr. Ripley is worth seeing more for its undeniably delightful journey than its final destination.\n",
        "Not only is it an elegantly polished affair, with top notch performances all round, and magnificent camerawork and editing, it's also acutely aware of how class, money and sex shape desire and resentment.\n",
        "It's a gorgeously unsettling film. You can hide in the shadows, but luminescence exposes who you are, and the only escape is into another identity.\n",
        "Even before its release, The Talented Mr. Ripley has attracted some mighty serious analytic attention.\n",
        "If anybody can create sympathy for the devil, the angelic Matt Damon can.\n",
        "The Talented Mr. Ripley loses a bit of its steam toward the end, but Minghella has still delivered an extremely provocative and well-made film.\n",
        "The movie is an intelligent a thriller as you'll see this year.\n",
        "The Talented Mr. Ripley is a purposeful visual feast.\n",
        "Again, Minghella proves himself the most stylish and literate of film makers.\n",
        "Performances are aces top to bottom.\n",
        "The movie gives us enticing sights and sounds, brilliant scenes, gifted actors and artists and at least part of one of the all-time great nerve-jangling thriller plots.\n",
        "Lacking in emotional impact.\n",
        "Perhaps at 90 or so minutes, it would have been the Hitchcockian thriller that it isn't at the beginning but turns into. At two hours and 20 minutes, there's too much of the film that feels like reiteration.\n",
        "The Talented Mr. Ripley may be Hitchcock on holiday, but that's a perfectly enjoyable vacation.\n",
        "It's an Italian feast, spiked with just enough arsenic to make the flavors interesting and dangerous.\n",
        "Next Friday is an extremely funny movie, and this is coming from someone who barely cracked a smile during Friday, the first installment of this franchise.\n",
        "Notable chiefly for feeding a stereotype of blacks as shiftless layabouts interested mainly in recreational drugs and irresponsible sex.\n",
        "The flick could use Chris Tucker, co-star of the first Friday, AWOL in the sequel. He probably took a look at the script and realized this sequel was no reason to shout, 'T.G.I.F.'\n",
        "Isn't quite the picture its predecessor was.\n",
        "One measure of its desperation and lack of respect for its audience is the frequency with which it labors to wring humor from flatulence and excrement gags.\n",
        "Its humor batting average would earn anybody an MVP.\n",
        "The real problem with Next Friday is that the whole movie is so ineptly written and directed that its 90 minutes seem to take twice as long.\n",
        "It delivers the same brand of cheap laughs.\n",
        "If there were any justice, Next Friday would be the last Friday. Somehow, I fear the first weekend grosses will make that unlikely.\n",
        "Next Friday is a truly awful film.\n",
        "Next Friday will eventually be remembered as a disposable farce, but one that leaves a happy memory.\n",
        "Next Friday has everything you loved about last Friday.\n",
        "The pic is too larky and goofy to come across as mean-spirited.\n",
        "Most of the humor is about as fresh as the air left behind whenever Witherspoon uses a toilet.\n",
        "Next Friday's a chronic snore.\n",
        "A mediocre sports movie crossed with a bad road picture.\n",
        "This is no Raging Bull.\n",
        "Lacks the pizazz of Shelton's best stuff.\n",
        "This boxing movie is one of [Alan's] best.\n",
        "Play It to the Bone isn't going to be a contender.\n",
        "The hope that Shelton would bring fresh insight to the sweet science is unfulfilled on nearly every level.\n",
        "Play It to the Bone is so constrained by its formulaic plot that the movie's juicy, freewheeling dialogue feels shoehorned into a story that makes more sense mathematically than psychologically.\n",
        "Doesn't quite have the goods.\n",
        "Bone tired.\n",
        "This is still Ron Shelton in good -- not great, but good -- form here, and the rewards are plentiful.\n",
        "Play It to the Bone is surely going to be too raw for some audiences, but it does pack a punch.\n",
        "As empty as a Don King pay-per-view bout.\n",
        "Doesn't have enough of a boxing story to occupy the running time.\n",
        "By the end, the fight means everything to them and virtually nothing to us.\n",
        "OK for laughs but less OK for emotional investment with the characters, who feel more like comic constructs than the real-feeling guys.\n",
        "A conditional victory.\n",

        "A striking addition to the Shakespeare filmography.\n",
        "Hopkins unwisely echoes his performance as Hannibal Lecter, but Lange rises to the occasion with a mesmerizingly in-your-face portrait of mother love gone haywire.\n",
        "Along with everything else, the acting styles here clash, though the dissonance serves the drama's bellicose theme.\n",
        "Jessica Lange as Tamora, the captured Goth queen, seethes with sexuality and vengeance.\n",
        "It functions like a giant meat grinder, making hash of everything it depicts.\n",
        "A lugubrious and occasionally laughable two hours and 40 minutes.\n",
        "This is the film Shakespeare's play deserves, and perhaps even a little more.\n",
        "A brilliant production of a mediocre play.\n",
        "While (Taymor's) film version isn't exactly a solemn spectacle, neither is it much fun.\n",
        "It's all plot twists and shock tactics, without the poetry and resonance of Shakespeare's later work.\n",
        "Despite its nearly three-hour running time, there are few dead spots.\n",
        "The film is striking and original and, in its clash of the brutal and the delicately poetic, supremely offputting.\n",
        "It's a rage that suits a proscenium, but nearly chokes a screen with smoke.\n",
        "Makes a brilliant case that it is the Shakespeare play for our time, a work of art that speaks directly to the age of Rwanda and Bosnia.\n",
        "Titus does no justice to Shakespeare.\n",
        "A strong case for Titus Andronicus to be taken much more seriously than it has been.\n",
        "The movie is often a lot of loopy fun -- it's just not very good.\n",
        "Viewed today, while Scarface seems less shocking than it did during its initial theatrical run, it's no more substantive or interesting.\n",
        "An unashamed study of selfish, sadistic criminality, and all the better for it.\n",
        "What were Pacino's detractors hoping for? Something internal and realistic? Low key? The Tony Montana character is above all a performance artist, a man who exists in order to gloriously be himself.\n",
        "I like it as a kind of B-movie version of The Godfather. There are a lot of classic lines and a handful of memorably horrific scenes ...\n",
        "The dominant mood of the film is anything but funny. It is bleak and futile: What goes up must always come down. When it comes down in Scarface, the crash is as terrifying as it is vivid and arresting.\n",
        "Snow Falling on Cedars is a motion picture of great thematic and visual richness.\n",
        "Hicks determinedly neglects almost every other narrative element for the sake of atmosphere, a decision that robs the film of almost everything that made Guterson's story compelling.\n",

        "Snow Falling on Cedars has to fight to hold our attention and it doesn't always succeed.\n",
        "Reveals itself with the complexity of a novel, holding its themes up to the light so that first one and then another aspect can be seen.\n",
        "Snow Falling is not a crowd-pleasing, or even audience-oriented, movie; it's a two-hour-plus mood piece.\n",
        "Dramatically inert.\n",

        "Does it matter that every time Jolie's offscreen the film wilts a little? Ryder should be perfect as the bright spark; her lines are sharp as a knife. There's a gap, however, between what we hear and what we see.\n",
        "A muddled production that misses the jarring tone of the autobiographical book by Susanna Kaysen on which it is based. The film is entertaining, but not very powerful.\n",
        "The film generates real empathy, without too much let's-laugh -at- the -crazy- people humor or too much stereotyping.\n",
        "They've managed to avoid the usual asylum-movie cliches.\n",
        "It has neither the clarity nor strength of purpose to engage an audience much beyond the converted.\n",

        "The best work [Ryder's] ever done.\n",
        "Unrelenting grimness settles over the movie like a soupy fog, changing shape only to add unnecessary suspense to the more ominous -- and obvious -- plot turns.\n",

        "You can drive yourself crazy, or you can get over it. The choice is yours.\n",
        "Although there are individual scenes of powerful acting, there doesn't seem to be a destination.\n",
        "The results are predictable and stale.\n",
        "It's difficult to imagine any actress today bringing more sentience and intelligence to [Ryder's] role.\n",
        "It's an odd mixture of an unsentimental, darkly humorous take on mental illness with the usual Hollywood loony-bin cliches.\n",
        "What helps the film stay as honest as it manages to sporadically be are the purity and grace of its lead performances by Ryder and Angelina Jolie.\n",
        "Shrewd, tough, and lively.\n",
        "Ryder is no Jack Nicholson. And Whoopi Goldberg sure as hell ain't Louise Fletcher.\n",

        "Aviva Kempner's warm and intelligent mash note to a man who clearly deserved it.\n",
        "Aviva Kempner's documentary The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg does what a historical documentary should do. It tells an inspiring story while bringing the past to life and illuminating issues that persist today.\n",
        "Aviva Kempner's documentary celebration of the Detroit Tigers first baseman defines one of those instances-- rarer than sportswriters admit -- in which a champion athlete becomes a genuine, all-around hero.\n",
        "Hank Greenberg is an unabashed paean and just a joy to watch. It should be required viewing for all modern athletes who disregard their role-model status.\n",
        "Kempner's lighthearted yet not apolitical collage conveys how Greenberg's success as an athlete in the 30s and 40s contradicted an ethnic stereotype.\n",
        "As good-natured and inspirational as its subject.\n",
        "Sharing its subject's virtues, it is a lovely addition to the annals of the Greatest Generation.\n",
        "It seems too much to ask a movie to entertain, inform and inspire. For it to also work as sports story, social history and biography is a home run with men on base.\n",
        "While it preserves his baseball feats, it looks beyond them to clarify Greenberg's place in American culture.\n",
        "For once, the image and the reality make for a perfect fit -- the man and the symbol are one.\n",
        "Greenberg seems down-to-earth and likable, and director Aviva Kempner slips in just enough baseball history for nonfans to follow Greenberg's story without getting bogged down in diamond minutiae.\n",
        "The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg is a sprightly, lovingly researched, rather misty-eyed sports documentary that's steeped in ethnic pride.\n",

        "Valuable as history and resonant with meaning for today.\n",

        "Worst of all, the Jack Russell playing Skip is allowed to mug a la Frasier's Eddie instead of behaving like an actual canine.\n",

        "The banal voice-over narration by Harry Connick Jr., combined with the gooey score and feckless direction adds up to a sterilization of American life that makes Norman Rockwell look like Diane Arbus.\n",

        "Light on originality and low on suspense.\n",
        "As rowdily entertaining on the screen as it was on the stage.\n",
        "The resulting letdown is terrific, but along the way there is some of the funniest men-at-loose-ends interplay that Wilder has ever put on film.\n",
        "One could make an argument that, among 20th century directors, few were more versatile than Billy Wilder.\n",
        "A lusty comedy-melodrama, loaded with bold, masculine humor and as much of the original's uninhibited earthiness as good taste and the Production Code permit.\n",
        "The good greatly outweighs the bad, particularly in the profile of Holden's character, a pragmatic, self-centered cynic whose heroism, when it is finally called upon, appears to come from deep within the barriers he has placed inside of himself.\n",
        "A fascinating film.\n",
        "A cracker jack movie entertainment.\n",
        "A rousing drama of endurance, opportunism and friendship under fire.\n",
        "Nicholson's cigar-chomping, profanity-spouting grunt is one of the greatest incarnations of stunted machismo onscreen, and he's brilliantly complemented by Quaid's picture-perfect awkwardness and Young's bracing cynicism.\n",
        "A tough-talking, sparely directed effort by Hal Ashby, with an immaculate performance by Jack Nicholson.\n",
        "Salty, bawdy, hilarious and very touching.\n",
        "One can't help feeling that the criticism of modern America hits out at all too easy targets in a vague and muffled manner.\n",
        "The Last Detail is one superbly funny, uproariously intelligent performance, plus two others that are very, very good, which are so effectively surrounded by profound bleakness that it seems to be a new kind of anti-comedy.\n",
        "Nicholson makes it all go. He proves he is more than a \"character actor\" with many scenes, especially the confrontation with his father.\n",
        "Five Easy Pieces, a brilliant gem of American psychological realism (where are these movies today?), is Nicholson's arrival to the A-list.\n",
        "It's a great work of the Discover America Seventies.\n",
        "The film's nervewracking quality is consistent with its content. Nicholson's performance is a remarkably varied and daring exploration of a complex character, equally convincing in its manic and sober aspects.\n",
        "The film embraces proletarian chic but still gets its laughs by abusing waitresses.\n",
        "The result is less a story and more a collection of incidents and character studies, all of which inform each other and extend our understanding of Nicholson's mode of survival: flight.\n",
        "Rafelson is expert at supporting this movement, and the film proceeds from scene to scene with a quiet competent modernism that bespeaks quality, but that more often begs than provides expression.\n",
        "We'd had a revelation. This was the direction American movies should take: Into idiosyncratic characters, into dialogue with an ear for the vulgar and the literate, into a plot free to surprise us about the characters, into an existential ending.\n",
        "Even Dwarfs Started Small eventually is indistinguishable from its Germanic, side-show spectacle, as if it were a movie that had been conceived by the same kind of perverse, uninvolved intelligence that had created the world of the film.\n",
        "Not a vicious denial of the legitimacy of revolt (as too many critics have charged) but a bitter lament over the disservice revolutionaries do their revolutions.\n",
        "Though not always entirely credible, Dead Calm is a nail-biting suspense pic [from the novel by Charles Williams] handsomely produced and inventively directed.\n",
        "A classic piece of pared-down genre film-making is lent extra depth by an emotional subtext stressing Kidman's transition from dependent wife to resourceful individual.\n",
        "\"Dead Calm\" ... becomes disturbing for all the wrong reasons.\n",
        "This is not a gimmick film ... and Kidman and Zane do generate real, palpable hatred in their scenes together.\n",
        "[Noyce is] a masterful manipulator, but eventually there is no more wind in these sails, not even enough to riffle a jib, as the story and Rae's character wear thin.\n",
        "For much of the movie, you're enthralled. By the end, you're laughing. This is not good.\n",
        "The plot is less suspenseful than the overacting contest between the two leads, Laurence Olivier and Gregory Peck, who spend most of their screen time one-upping each other in affectations.\n",
        "With two excellent antagonists in Gregory Peck and Laurence Olivier, The Boys from Brazil presents a gripping, suspenseful drama for nearly all of its two hours -- then lets go at the end and falls into a heap.\n",
        "The answer should have made a great thriller, but the film is sunk by a series of preposterous performances.\n",
        "The visual style still impresses, but the story beneath it has become too formularised for the film to retain all its original power.\n",
        "It will leave its audiences yearning for that quiet, sunny little motel in Psycho.\n",
        "A new low in lame spoofery.\n",
        "This film is stale.\n",
        "A buddy cop parody of the lowest possible caliber.\n",
        "Director Amy Heckerling has failed to provide the raunch or poignancy that would interest young moviegoers, all of whom have seen American Graffiti and its 467 imitators. Ridgemont High? A nice place to visit, but who would want to transfer there?\n",
        "Fast Times will always be remembered for one thing: showing respect for and insight into the members of its core audience, something that was as rare in the 1980s as it is today.\n",
        "The nice thing is that Crowe and director Amy Heckerling have provided something pleasant to observe in all of these characters though they really are sadly lacking in anything gripping.\n",
        "Was never all it was cracked up to be.\n",
        "Lacks the frenzied energy which allowed Porky's to beat all competitors in its field.\n",
        "How could they do this to Jennifer Jason Leigh? How could they put such a fresh and cheerful person into such a scuz-pit of a movie?\n",
        "A jumbled but appealing teen-age comedy with something of a fresh perspective on the subject.\n",
        "The violence is too realistic (though not terribly graphic) to qualify as cartoony escapism, yet the movie lacks the sophistication, vision or satirical edge to lay claim to any higher purpose. It's merely dark for dark's sake.\n",
        "While the script and pedigree of actors are commendable, the craft level is too close to the small-screen offering to get audiences into theaters.\n",
        "The actor's voices may suit animated television characters, but on a large screen Kevin Conroy's Batman, Mark Hamill's Joker, and Dana Delany's Andrea sound flat and one-dimensional.\n",
        "Closer to radio drama than kiddie fare, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is the strangest PG film of the year.\n",
        "Unfortunately, overblown production just pumps hot air in too many directions and comes up limp.\n",
        "A pleasant, straight-down-the-road, cliche-ridden ride.\n",
        "The performances aren't bad, but they aren't good enough to give the film the heft it doesn't otherwise have.\n",
        "American Flyers is shaky at the core, because it tries to tap-dance around its own central issues.\n",
        "Extremely prolific and generally untalented, Jess Franco is the Spanish Ed Wood, albeit without Wood's gift for humorously inane dialogue.\n",
        "I could have done without the designer prison, but most of the other stylistic conceits work.\n",
        "Arguably the strongest American debut feature of the '90s.\n",
        "Todd Haynes' Poison is a conceptually bold, stylistically audacious first feature, a compelling study of different forms of deviance.\n",
        "Boldly self conscious, Poison switches channels among its three stylistically varied but thematically linked tales with cumulative, claustrophobic power.\n",
        "Compelling and quirkily intelligent; Genet, one feels, would have been impressed.\n",
        "The movie needs to evoke more than the ghost of Genet to give it resonance.\n",
        "Its effect, as a whole, is like that of an especially vile infection; it moves diabolically through your system, spreading fever and nausea as it goes.\n",
        "What's truly revolutionary about this filmmaker -- his perverse, ironic humanity -- is only intermittently on display in this quasi-provocative formalist knickknack\n",
        "Artificial in the extreme, it may nevertheless be Greenaway's most naturalistic and easygoing film.\n",
        "[Director] Dornford-May deftly balances the details of his setting with the universality of his themes, exploring every dusty corner of a village thrumming with tension between patriarchal leaders and strong-willed women.\n",
        "No one can know whether Bizet would have approved of the movie musical U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha. But you suspect that he would have admired the filmmakers' gall.\n",
        "A vivacious film that is a treat for eyes and ears.\n",
        "This was basically the best idea ever.\n",
        "Performances and singing are both on the money, and the film's organic, realistic feel seems to have been bolstered by the translation contribution that thesps Malefane and Andiswa Kedama made to the screenplay.\n",
        "The main attraction is the performance of Carmen by the magnificent Pauline Malefane, who also translated the libretto into Xhosa.\n",
        "U-Carmen hits the bull's eye, 'Toreador's or not.\n",
        "Tells a complicated story, gives unique voice to a classic piece of music, and opens a window on contemporary South Africa in a pleasing, symmetrical fashion.\n",
        "An enjoyably decadent, ridiculously convoluted thingamajig.\n",
        "A bizarre film, distinguished not so much by Kobo Abe's rather obvious screenplay as by Teshigahara's arresting visual style of extreme depth of focus, immaculate detail, and graceful eroticism.\n",
        "Teshigahara's direction and Segawa's camera-work often render the mundane startling and new, a claim that only good films can make.\n",
        "In stunningly composed images by Teshigahara and cinematographer Hiroshi Segawa, that eroticism becomes overwhelming.\n",
        "Woman in the Dunes remains a masterpiece, a timeless contemplation of life's essential mystery and a triumph of bold, innovative style.\n",
        "Filmed with a palpable physicality that remains extraordinary.\n",
        "A strongly allegorical, strangely engrossing film.\n",
        "More than almost any other film I can think of, Woman in the Dunes' uses visuals to create a tangible texture -- of sand, of skin, of water seeping into sand and changing its nature.\n",
        "It's like watching the dreckiest of teen puppy courtships trying to pass itself off as 'Annie Hall.\n",
        "It's all reasonably pleasant to watch, but Isacsson doesn't seem to know what to do with the story once Al and Imogen fall in love.\n",
        "[A] relentlessly adolescent romantic comedy.\n",
        "Al (Prinze) and Imogen (Stiles) are 19-year-olds tackling New York college life. The course of their relationship is charted in numbing detail and interspersed with the antics of their quirky friends.\n",
        "Belongs to that other kind of American teen comedy... movies of crushes and wagers and sex jokes, with patchwork plots and a standby army of eccentric comic sidekicks.\n",
        "Doesn't summon up quite enough quirky personality to maintain its momentum through the final act.\n",
        "The acting never gets muscular enough to make the audience care about what happens.\n",
        "Woefully unamusing.\n",
        "Lamely written and directed.\n",
        "Not really all that much fun.\n",
        "Relies too much on gimmicky flashbacks and the quirkiness of the movie's supporting characters to compensate for the uninteresting leads.\n",
        "Flees from anything that might involve real human emotion, or for that matter any credible human activity other than looking good.\n",
        "Writer/director Kris Isacsson, in his directorial debut, clearly has little confidence in the romantic 'A' story supporting his film.\n",
        "Down to You is filled with all sorts of hokey moments that ruin its attempts to generate a pseudo-real, romantic atmosphere.\n",
        "There's little chemistry between co-stars Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles.\n",
        "Mediocre at best.\n",
        "Voight's performance gives credibility to his character's obsession, but even that cannot overcome the discrepancy between the deeper themes and the routine nature of this piece of box-office action adventure.\n",
        "The film makes its points methodically, almost academically.\n",
        "The surprises increasingly fail to surprise.\n",
        "Distinguished from a Discovery special by its uniquely fowl-minded aesthetic.\n",
        "As misogynistic as anything I've seen in ages, it's tricked up with enough fancy cinematography (by Guy Dufaux) to guarantee it sub-Hitchcockian credentials of the sort that some reviewers eagerly hand out to Brian De Palma.\n",
        "The result is compellingly bonkers.\n",
        "Remove the directorial flash and filigree, and its narrative would be easier to track.\n",
        "It's late January, winter is entrenched, and in the lull between the bounty of Christmas and the renewal of spring, the big screen can sometimes seem barren -- a movable famine.\n",
        "In trying to both inflame and indict our morbid curiosity, Elliott fails to make the needed connection between the audience and a peeper who has lost his moral balance.\n",
        "Impenetrable mess of a movie.\n",
        "The movie might be worth seeing if you could find a theater that offers frequent-flier miles.\n",
        "The tone is stillborn and static when it should be ominous and engrossing. The characters fail to connect with the audience. This is a cold, distant, and off-putting motion picture that generates little in the way of tension or suspense.\n",
        "Eye of the Beholder attempts to convey emotional dislocation and passion at the same time. All we get is distance.\n",
        "Not terribly enjoyable to watch.\n",
        "Eye of the Beholder more or less throws Vertigo, The Conversation, Body Double, and -- so help me -- Duel in the Sun into a blender and hits puree.\n",
        "Eye of the Beholder suffers from blurry vision at best. Don't let your eyes behold it.\n",
        "Long on style but perilously short on logic and coherence.\n",
        "It isn't insultingly bad; it's just incompetent.\n",
        "Eye of the Beholder is yet another example of how bad movies can happen to good people.\n",
        "The more complex it tries to be, the less compelling it becomes.\n",
        "Beholder tries to blend old film noir and new high-tech thriller styles with only sporadic impact.\n",
        "The most notable aspect of this trashy (but unenjoyable) biopic of Jacquleine Susann, Valley of the Doll's best-selling author, is its running time (93 minutes); Bette Midler and Nathan Lane give two of their worst and broadest performances.\n",
        "The filmmakers don't know what to make of their overblown subject.\n",

        "Here is a movie that needed great trash, great sex and great gossip, and at all the crucial moments Susann is talking to a tree.\n",
        "Isn't She Great is an oxymoron.\n",
        "What's not there is the ability to stitch together the light tone of screwball comedy with the uncomfortable business of real biography.\n",
        "Neither Midler nor director Bergman are able to navigate the queasy shifts from camp cartoon to bathos, as Susann sputters in denial over her cancer and autistic son.\n",
        "A surprisingly warm and engaging entertainment.\n",
        "Burt Bacharach is an inspired, period-perfect choice to compose the film's score, which deftly echoes the music, and in particular, the theme song of the Valley of the Dolls movie.\n",
        "If you're looking for laughs, give Valley of the Dolls another read instead.\n",
        "Crawford's such a good-hearted guy, you can't help but want a cut from his clippers.\n",
        "A sub-sitcom stretched to an interminable 85 minutes.\n",
        "Does a lot of little stuff right.\n",
        "Although it has its moments, The Big Tease doesn't fulfill its potential.\n",
        "Directed by Briton Kevin Allen (Twin Town) with just the right light touch.\n",
        "Charming.\n",
        "A sampling of previous crowd-pleasers.\n",
        "The Big Tease aims to do nothing but please, and it accomplishes its modest aim with charm and intelligence.\n",
        "Likely to vanish from theaters in a blink.\n",
        "Sloppy.\n",
        "Crawford is engaging as what he calls 'Rocky in Curlers,' though he wears out his welcome by the end.\n",
        "Low-budget quickie is insulting even within its own no-effort parameters.\n",
        "Depressingly witless.\n",

        "Encino Man saves its worst for last, especially with life lessons about Being Yourself.\n",
        "The kind of movie that gives evolution a bad name.\n",
        "Some of the most exhilarating camera movements and most luscious black-and-white cinematography you'll ever see inhabit this singular, delirious 141-minute communist propaganda epic.\n",
        "Cinema's singular dream, so often betrayed elsewhere, is to deliver such visions as this.\n",
        "It is one of the most visually hypnotic films ever -- and that's not hyperbole.\n",
        "The resulting assault is so epicly impassioned it's less about Cuba per se than the fusillade of movement, shadow, light, vertigo, and landscape on the viewer's tender optic nerves.\n",
        "It is a dream of life in which everything is reduced to black and white. Or as the rhetoric used to go, you are either part of the problem or part of the solution. Nothing was ever quite that simple.\n",
        "In a sense, it's a movie about looking past surfaces to see what's in front of you. It takes the time to look around and discovers majesty, beauty and pathos everywhere it turns.\n",
        "One of the most stylistically vigorous films of all time.\n",
        "As an example of lyrical black and white filmmaking, it is still stunning. If you see it, try to figure out how the camera floated down that wall.\n",
        "Spike Lee has made a disappointingly conventional and sluggish film in Malcolm X.\n",
        "Benefits from a lively lead performance by the miscast Denzel Washington but doesn't come within light years of the book, one of the greatest American autobiographies.\n",
        "Lee and company have performed a powerful service: they have brought Malcolm X very much to life again, both as man and myth.\n",
        "Lee sketches Malcolm's life colorfully, if by the numbers. But he falls victim to the danger of movie biography: he elevates Malcolm's importance until the vital historical context is obscured.\n",
        "It plays surprisingly safe as a solidly crafted trawl through the didactic/hagiographic conventions of the mainstream biopic.\n",
        "An ambitious, tough, seriously considered biographical film that, with honor, eludes easy characterization.\n",
        "A spiritually enriching testament to the human capacity for change -- and surely Spike Lee's most universally appealing film.\n",
        "Lee has chosen a big subject and, with his quirky talent, has done it superb justice.\n",
        "This is an extraordinary life, and Spike Lee has told it in an extraordinary film.\n",
        "Two trips to the convent is one too many.\n",
        "I hope what they all got paid made it worth the bother.\n",
        "Bouncy musical numbers and plenty of social concern, but the star, regrettably, is on autopilot.\n",
        "The sequel suffers from a lame, saccharine premise and a fatally earnest manner.\n",
        "This is another one of those dreary retreads about a bunch of kids with no faith in themselves, and about how an inspiring teacher coaches them into the State Finals, where they upset the snobs from the rich school.\n",
        "This shoddiest of sequels should be the last act for these sorry Sisters.\n",
        "It's kind of frightening that it took three writers to come up with this \"plot\".\n",
        "Shamelessly contrived pap.\n",
        "This is De Mornay's film and she's a wicked treat, looking daggers at her enemy one moment and then glazing over with sweetness the next.\n",
        "The film is unusually gripping.\n",
        "The careful structure of THTRTC guarantees that the movie will generate a fair amount of suspense throughout. But the single-mindedness of the movie is a genuine limitation, and, watching it, you begin to feel spoon-fed.\n",
        "With its banal, docile household threatened by an enemy within, the film is like The Stepfather without wit or irony.\n",
        "At its best, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle is a bright, nasty psychological thriller with a joker up its sleeve.\n",
        "Unpretentious and efficient.\n",
        "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle keeps you watching, yet this oddly somber thriller is really just a transparent chain of contrivances; it's all stunts, all concept.\n",
        "A low-key thriller that will make baby boomers double-check the references of any prospective nanny.\n",
        "Curtis Hanson's direction and Amanda Silver's screenplay are both models of no-flab craft and intelligence, and all the actors (who also include Ernie Hudson and Julianne Moore) are believable from the first frame to the last.\n",
        "As the film progresses, malicious schemes and loony excesses are combined, with Hanson's self-conscious direction rendering one particularly sensational murder even more implausible.\n",
        "Hanson creates the occasionally effective shock effect to satisfy those who want to squeal in mock fright. More often the devices he uses are such tired tricks... to create the illusion of suspense that can't be sustained.\n",
        "Cradle is the kind of cheap thrill you hate yourself for responding to. But director Curtis Hanson and a terrific cast provide enough scary fun to make Cradle the first fright-night hit of '92.\n",
        "This anti-feminist parable is both a labor and a pain.\n",
        "All three stars do smart, honorable work.\n",
        "While Agnes of God has been considerably opened up, it is actually muddled in its transfer from stage to screen.\n",
        "Despite all the anguished huffing and puffing, there isn't a single authentic moment in it.\n",
        "It is Meg Tilly who makes the movie live. Her performance, which works on both realistic and symbolic levels, allows you to believe in the story.\n",
        "Agnes of God plays with some challenging ideas and some sensationalistic events, but ultimately it fails to earn its right to toy with such subjects.\n",
        "Fonda's relentless interrogating, mannered chain-smoking and enforced two dimensionality cause her to become tiresome very early on.\n",
        "Splendidly shot by Sven Nykvist and with excellent performances, it's an agreeable puzzle which doesn't, thank heaven, come up with a solution to the meaning of life.\n",
        "Miss Tilly makes a radiant Agnes, and Miss Bancroft a shrewd, forceful Mother Superior, but the writing limits each of their roles.\n",
        "Although the movie deals in the basic materials of a criminal investigation (cynical cops, forensic details, courtroom testimony), it has a seriously clouded agenda.\n",
        "An irascible bully who proves to have a heart of gold, Pacino's character seems manufactured by a computer programmed with box-office grosses.\n",
        "Scent of a Woman indulgently stretches a modest conceit well past the breaking point.\n",
        "Corny and heart-warming, with O'Donnell proving almost a match for the master.\n",
        "The good thing is that the principals and film makers make the absolute most of a conventional opportunity.\n",
        "By the end of Scent of a Woman, we have arrived at the usual conclusion of the coming-of-age movie, and the usual conclusion of the prep school movie. But rarely have we been taken there with so much intelligence and skill.\n",
        "This is a great performance from Pacino, who has the good luck here to work with Goldman's mostly wonderful, edgy script.\n",
        "As portrayed by Pacino, there's far more to this man that a rancorous outlook on life and a couple of hearty \"hoo-ha\"s.\n",
        "When all Pacino's demons are bared, they don't add up to the poignant punchline you were set up for.\n",
        "An epic picaresque in the tradition of Rain Man, Scent of a Woman is Al Pacino's entry into the Dustin Hoffman virtousic-one-man-show sweepstakes.\n",
        "Hilarious.\n",
        "Much funnier than the first film.\n",
        "This film is sometimes too familiar, especially in early scenes that deliberately repeat the first film's gags. But the formula isn't tired yet.\n",
        "The secret to the comedy of the Wayne's World movies is their goodwill... and in Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar the series has created two characters it is impossible to dislike.\n",
        "The sequel to last year's breakaway hit offers more of the same, but it's somehow fresher, funnier and more endearing than the airheaded original.\n",
        "Carvey is such a lovable doofus and Myers such a well-intentioned naif that it's hard to get down on them, especially considering that the heirs to their niche in pop iconography are Beavis and Butt-head.\n",
        "There are some worthwhile moments in Wayne's World 2, but not enough to justify a feature-length movie.\n",
        "Though amusing enough to avoid absolutely drowning in schmaltz, it's sad to see a film with potential lose its way in the late innings.\n",
        "What does it say about today's Hollywood when the most interesting character in a movie about a women's baseball team turns out to be a man?\n",
        "Few of the other performers make an impression. A director who can lose Madonna in a crowd can't be said to appreciate charisma.\n",
        "This movie aims for the tear ducts and the funny bone as ruthlessly as the big action-fantasy hits go after the viscera.\n",
        "Hits about .250 with a few RBI, but more than its share of strikeouts.\n",
        "Energetic, full of goodwill and good feelings, it never quite attains the graceful nonchalance and self-confidence with which finely tuned athletes -- and comedies -- move and enchant us.\n",
        "Deftly structured by director Penny Marshall and writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel to resemble a 40s musical (albeit, somewhat anachronistically, one in 'Scope); the rest is mainly streamlined and spirited teamwork.\n",
        "Scriptwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel neglect the ensemble, emphasising a sense of historical occasion over character development.\n",
        "One of the year's most cheerful, most relaxed, most easily enjoyable comedies. It's a serious film that's lighter than air, a very funny movie that manages to score a few points for feminism in passing.\n",
        "At her best, Marshall captures the camaraderie of these women in ways that rip the film out of its cliched roots.\n",
        "Graced by Davis and enlivened by Lovitz and the ensemble cast, it sends us home feeling a little higher, with visions of peanuts and Cracker Jack floating in our heads.\n",
        "Marshall gums it all up in hokey sentiment.\n",
        "The movie has a real bittersweet charm.\n",
        "From its jokey, one-note characters to its endless baseball montages, A League of Their Own is all flash, all surface: It's a great big trailer for itself.\n",
        "The movie kills most of the fun by watering down Clancy.\n",
        "Director Phillip Noyce, who made the gripping thriller Dead Calm, has earned his directorial hack license here.\n",
        "The film holds too few surprises to sustain our interest. All too often, we're ahead of the game.\n",
        "I expected this one to be a little more cerebral and without the Indiana Jones ending.\n",
        "The Bodyguard is an outrageous piece of saccharine kitsch -- or, at least, it might have been had the movie seemed fully awake.\n",
        "A jumbled mess, with a few enjoyable moments but little continuity or flow.\n",
        "Lawrence Kasdan, it seems, mulled over the first draft of his screenplay twenty years ago; it should have been left to languish in development purgatory.\n",
        "Two long hours and 10 minutes after this tale begins, Rachel and Frank seem no closer than seatmates on a long bus trip.\n",
        "It's only a matter of time before love arises between Mr. Earphone and Ms. High Note. By that time, Bodyguard has slumped to the ground.\n",
        "[Costner] was probably more alive as the corpse in The Big Chill than he is here.\n",
        "The movie does contain a love story, but it's the kind of guarded passion that grows between two people who spend a lot of time keeping their priorities straight.\n",
        "The performances are impeccable, but honours go to Thompson, who manages to make Margaret's saintliness actually seem seductive.\n",
        "It's time for legislation decreeing that no one be allowed to make a screen adaptation of a novel of any quality whatsoever if Ismail Merchant, James Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala are available, and if they elect to do the job.\n",
        "The film serves Forster by taking to heart the book's epigraph: \"Only connect.\"\n",
        "Merchant and Ivory have regathered many of the cast and crew from their earlier films to work on this reproduction to exquisite effect.\n",
        "A film seething with anger, passion, greed and emotional violence. That the characters are generally well-behaved says less about their manners than their inhibitions.\n",
        "Singles may aspire to be a Big Chill from Seattle, but it is really a fizzled St. Elmo's Fire with rowdier music.\n",
        "So lightweight that you're likely to start forgetting it before it's even over.\n",
        "There's no shortage of tender moments in this comedy, and former rock journalist Cameron Crowe cleverly transforms 'real' problems into crackerjack material.\n",
        "Crowe suffuses the film with tender humour and affection as the characters, most of them living in the same apartment block, swap stories, ponder sexual come-ons where none exist, and remain resolute in the face of emotional horrors.\n",
        "Mr. Crowe has an exceptional ability to enjoy such characters without a trace of condescension.\n",
        "A diverting collection of interwoven vignettes.\n",
        "Fonda is absolutely charming and sweetly resilient as her new and old relationships overlap.\n",
        "The movie will challenge some audiences simply because it is not a 1-2-3 progression of character and plot.\n",
        "A disarmingly sweet-spirited comedy written and directed by Cameron Crowe.\n",
        "In its own singular, deeply strange way, Fire Walk With Me is David Lynch's masterpiece.\n",
        "There have always been two sides to Lynch: the inscrutable, demonic prankster and the rhapsodic dreamer. In Fire Walk With Me, he's at least trying to recover his poetic sincerity. If only his dreams weren't starting to look like reruns.\n",
        "At its best, it's a dream within a dream, a nightmare in endlessly reflecting pop mirrors, a screen full of TV-movie sex and horror kitsch blowing up right in our faces.\n",
        "In Twin Peaks the movie, all the twists get straightened out. The thrill is gone.\n",
        "For those who are willing to go the distance with Lynch, the return trip to Twin Peaks is well worth the trouble.\n",
        "For a film with a pre-established conclusion, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me seems depressingly interminable.\n",
        "Suspense is clearly lacking in this story with a preordained outcome. Another significant drawback is that long before the climax Laura has become a tiresome teen.\n",
        "It has its moments, but not many, and generally speaking it runs neck and neck with Dune as the least successful and interesting Lynch feature.\n",
        "Self-parody would seem too generous an assessment of Lynch's aims and achievement.\n",
        "The film appears to be an undifferentiated mess of story lines and hallucinations. There's no reason to care which is which. Even Mr. Lynch's eccentric touches become boring. The jokes are stillborn.\n",
        "If inspiration is lacking, talent is not. Count Lynch down but never out.\n",
        "Fans of the dark comedy will find little to laugh about -- unless it is Lynch's pretentiousness -- in this horrific look at Laura's last seven days.\n",
        "A fresh and exuberant romantic comedy that is as smart about playground basketball as Bull Durham was about minor league baseball.\n",
        "They're black and white instead of fat and thin, but Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson have the makings of a classic comedy team, the Laurel and Hardy of the half-court game.\n",
        "Harrelson's performance is rich, subtle, and delicately funny. And Snipes is just amazing: everything he does seems to leap off the screen.\n",
        "White Man Can't Jump is most effective at the beginning -- when it's bouncing along with the exuberance that Shelton brought to such other sports-minded movies as Bull Durham and The Best of Times.\n",
        "Despite charismatic performances by Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes as nothing-but- net shooters who might be called the Schmo and the Bro, White Men Can't Jump throws up mostly bricks.\n",
        "It's a funny, frequently rousing film, with a warmly appealing acting partnership at its center-between basketball hustlers Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson.\n",
        "White Men features some amusingly daft racial banter.\n",
        "This picture is packed with fun, but it doesn't really go anywhere.\n",
        "A double-whammy slam-dunker of a movie.\n",
        "This film unfolds in an uncommonly sweet, harmonious climate, one in which rude remarks are the sine qua non of friendship. And that benign atmosphere becomes a large part of its charm.\n",
        "What Shelton fails to provide is a coherent structure; the film is wearyingly repetitive.\n",
        "For the most part, it's a provocative one-on-one between racial opposites Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson.\n",
        "Here is a comedy of great high spirits, with an undercurrent of sadness and sweetness that makes it a lot better than the plot itself could possibly suggest.\n",
        "This is one director who loves words, and what a rare thing that is.\n",
        "Joss Whedon's script has some fun with Valley talk (both genuine and ersatz) but strains to sell the story.\n",
        "A bloodless comic resurrection of the undead that goes serious just when it should get wild and woolly.\n",
        "Unfocused stuff, pitched at undemanding teenagers.\n",
        "A slight, good-humored film that's a lot more painless than might have been expected.\n",
        "As a friend tells Buffy while she eyes a fashion purchase, 'It's so five minutes ago.'\n",
        "The jokes are pretty good, the premise is just off-the-wall enough to keep you tittering.\n",
        "The second half feels stretched out and muddled, as if screenwriter Joss Whedon drove a stake through his script.\n",
        "Has a verve and cheekiness that's partly a smart wedding of such influences as Sergio Leone, George Miller and south-of-the-border noir.\n",
        "Juicy, adroit, and likable.\n",
        "Rodriguez goes for broke with a breakneck pace, swarms of bullets, cinematic tricks, and a tone as playful as it is knowing of genre conventions. The director's light touch is all his own; and this unpretentious offering delivers in all departments.\n",
        "It goes without saying that Mr. Rodriguez, having made such a clever and inventive debut, is prepared for a big future of his own.\n",
        "A gripping, tautly-paced action flick that outdoes most of Hollywood's similar output.\n",
        "An enormously entertaining movie.\n",
        "Watching his film, you can feel the sheer joy that went into its creation.\n",
        "Most of the blame for this unimaginative effort can be attributed to the script, but Spottiswoode's flat direction doesn't help.\n",
        "This mom is impossible without being funny.\n",
        "It is moronic beyond comprehension, an exercise in desperation during which even Sylvester Stallone, a repository of self-confidence, seems to be disheartened.\n",
        "As irksome as it is, the concept is actually better for Stallone than the premises of his earlier awful romps.\n",
        "Well-mounted and very traditional, Of Mice and Men honorably serves John Steinbeck's classic story of two Depression-era drifters without bringing anything new to it.\n",
        "It's hard ... to believe Malkovich's shamble and gape, a simian variant on Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man.\n",
        "Of Mice and Men is a mournful, distantly heard lament for the loss of American innocence.\n",
        "Happily, director/star/co-producer Gary Sinise has approached it not with the awe of an English professor, but with the practical eye of a craftsman: Here are solid characters, a taut and emotional story, a beginning, a middle and a wrenching end.\n",
        "I would not have thought I could believe the line about the rabbits one more time, but this movie made me do it, as Lennie asks about the farm they'll own one day, and George says, yes, it will be just as they've imagined it.\n",
        "The great pleasure of this movie is in what performers Sinise and John Malkovich, Ray Walton and others do with it; what director Sinise does with it; and, perhaps most important, what screenwriter Horton Foote does with it.\n",
        "The new film version of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is lyrical, stirring, and beautifully acted -- a seamless adaptation of a novel many will recall with almost too much familiarity.\n",
        "Members of the gutter-al elite will be the sole survivors.\n",
        "Bad Lieutenant is finally a pulp parable of sin, addiction, and redemption, a movie that, like its subversive hero, revels in the pleasure -- and danger -- of going too far.\n",
        "Abel Ferrara's uncompromising Bad Lieutenant is a harrowing journey with a corrupt N.Y. cop sinking into the lower depths.\n",
        "There's an undeniable formal elegance in the way Ferrara, who coauthored the script with Zoe Lund, frames and holds certain shots, and Keitel certainly gives his all.\n",
        "Ferrara allows his star to dictate the pace, and is rewarded with a performance of extraordinary, terrifying honesty.\n",
        "When Abel Ferrara calls something bad, better believe it: he means business.\n",
        "This punishing film from director Abel Ferrara is something else altogether -- an illuminating, excoriating descent into the cesspool of sin, self-loathing and defilement. This is not an easy film to watch.\n",
        "Harvey Keitel plays this man with such uncompromised honesty that the performance can only be called courageous; not many actors would want to be seen in this light.\n",
        "As good as the lead actor is, he's not enough to save this picture from landing on the scrap-heap of uninspired, derivative, and grotesquely distasteful character studies.\n",
        "It doesn't take five minutes for us to understand the depth of his immorality. But the movie proceeds to outline his badness.\n",
        "Tthe movie belabors the idea that it's the last of a trilogy rather than the third in a series.\n",
        "A limp movie-within-a-movie parody that closed the trilogy with a fizzle instead of the bang it deserved.\n",
        "Scream 3 is a crafty and well-crafted wrap-up that really does bring a satisfying sense of closure to the franchise.\n",
        "Craven has produced a poor carbon copy of his own New Nightmare.\n",
        "Fulfills its modest ambitions by delivering a glib slasher spoof for the mall crowd.\n",
        "The result is the usual fragmentary mixture of jolts and jokes, knife-wielding maniacs and red herrings.\n",
        "You're bound to scream -- perhaps real loud -- but it may be out of impatient dismay as much as Pavlovian reaction.\n",
        "Despite the various surprise cameos and cute twists, it takes itself too seriously and adheres too strictly to its formula to avoid becoming what it parodies.\n",
        "Unfortunately, there's nothing here that even the most inexperienced horror film fan would call innovative, and the predictable result is a movie that pales in comparison with its predecessors.\n",
        "Holds up the honor of the franchise nicely.\n",
        "New-kid-on-the-block screenwriter Ethan Kruger acquits himself admirably in filling tapped-out creator Kevin Williamson's big, black boots.\n",
        "[Wraps] up the trilogy in satisfying fashion.\n",
        "What began as mildly entertaining reflexivity has degenerated into a mindless barrage of illogical hooey, herrings as red as stop signs, cardboard characters, tepid jokes about movies as life, etc.\n",
        "Overly convoluted.\n",
        "Genuinely scary and also highly amusing.\n",
        "The only thing the movie kills with any decisiveness is your time.\n",
        "Funny and brisk.\n",
        "If Scream was like a funny joke, Scream 2 was like somebody telling you, 'here's how I heard that joke,' and Scream 3 is like somebody who won't believe you've already heard it.\n",
        "There's something dehumanizing about 90s horror thrillers that all but defeats the film's impulses toward seriousness; no matter how much the filmmakers work to make the characters real, the genre contrives to turn them into functions and props.\n",
        "Despite excellent lead performances and numerous memorable scenes, this still feels like two different movies in one.\n",
        "If his two leads are adequate to the slick mechanisms of a formulaic thriller, neither they nor Don Roos' script (based on the novel by John Lutz) offer any original insights into insatiable emotional dependence.\n",
        "The film is smooth, entertaining and believably sophisticated. It has far more sound psychological underpinnings than other movies of its type.\n",
        "Schroeder goes through the motions -- the movie is elegantly made -- but this synthetic Hollywood package panders shamelessly to the baser instincts.\n",
        "The tension between its content and its trashy form is precisely the key to its vitality. If it were any less cheap, it wouldn't have the same edgy, gut-twisting jolt.\n",
        "This is a story which, in other hands, could have simply been an all-female slasher movie, but Barbet Schroeder, who produced and directed it, has a mordant humor that pushes the material over the top. It is a slasher movie, and a little more.\n",
        "You watch this thing coolly intrigued and sometimes amused, rather than terrified and taken in -- even when the stabbing raises its bloody, predictable hand.\n",
        "More interested in finding fresh ways to stage execution scenes than in finding meaning behind the human urge for self-appointed righting of wrongs, pic is stuffed with effects that have no lasting impact.\n",
        "Weird exercise in toilet humor.\n",
        "Not only is the script incomprehensible, the film wasn't edited or directed -- it was crammed into a Cuisinart.\n",
        "A half hour in and still, the plot, tone, and setting are incomprehensible.\n",
        "Gun Shy is worth at least a shot at a matinee.\n",
        "He (Eric Blakeney) shows real promise with clever dialogue and plotting, and especially with creating a gallery of intriguing characters.\n",
        "Gun Shy can't rise on wobbly legs.\n",
        "The movie is marred by an overreliance on unfunny bathroom gags.\n",
        "The direction is proficient\n",
        "Gone Baby Gone is an argument for obligation over accommodation, the absolute over the contingent.\n",
        "Flawed but impressive.\n",
        "Mr. Affleck is laying the foundation, brick by brick, for a promising new career.\n",
        "Ben directs Casey in Gone Baby Gone, and it's a career highlight for both of them.\n",
        "The unconvincing genre conventions in Gone Baby Gone are at odds with its authentic, lived-in atmosphere, but no one can say that Affleck hasn't looked into the depths, and the movie ends on a resonantly ambiguous note.\n",
        "Casey's big brother has made a tough, taut mystery.\n",
        "Bravo to Ben Affleck for a smart choice and impressive work.\n",
        "As an actor, Affleck has more turkeys on his rA (C)sumA (C) than a Thanksgiving buffet, so what makes him think he can direct? Yet Gone Baby Gone is strong enough to suggest that moviegoers -- and critics -- should give him the benefit of the doubt.\n",
        "There's nothing flashy about Ben Affleck's direction. He clearly adores actors, and he's found the right vehicle to express what they can do.\n",
        "The film is full of scenes that make the hair stand up on the back of your neck.\n",
        "The film is intelligent and always heading somewhere.\n",
        "Lehane's superb plotting serves the director well, and Affleck's unblinking view of the world he seems to know, with an emphasis on ugliness, self-perpetuating despair and the wrong sorts of people having children, serves Lehane's story.\n",
        "Affleck shows a real affection for performers and their work; after assembling a good cast, he's not afraid to let them go on a little bit.\n",
        "A twisty, morally ambiguous and satisfying neo-noir.\n",
        "Structurally, it's a bit murky, but in every other way Gone Baby Gone marks a triumph for the Affleck brothers.\n",
        "A film that indicates its first-time director knows what he's doing.\n",
        "There's finally much less than meets the eye in what amounts to a linear tour of Greater Boston's criminal minds.\n",
        "Brooding, somber film is ragged around the edges and not without problematic aspects.\n",
        "Toplined by handsome Brit thesp Rupert Graves, offbeat serio comedy concerns the evolving friendhsip and eventual love between a rambunctious macho and a quiet insecure transsexual.\n",
        "The story has a TV movie shorthand calculation and slightness.\n",
        "One of the reasons why Different for Girls works is because of the caliber of acting.\n",
        "The subtlety with which Mackintosh conveys her complicated mixture of vulnerability, defensiveness and pride makes [Kim] one of the most fully realized characters to be portrayed on the screen in a long time.\n",
        "This irrepressible and sensitive romance brings new flavor to the term odd couple.\n",
        "As Kim, Mackintosh's performance finds and holds the right notes, of shyness, determination, privacy and love.\n",
        "There are all kinds of love relationships in this world, and perhaps they all deserve a romantic comedy this unflinching and this sensitive.\n",
        "It's a lot of fun.\n",
        "The fact is that although I admired specific things about the film, I never laughed very much and only felt slight, distant tremors of the joy that, I assume, rocked everyone connected with the movie during its production.\n",
        "The movie is sort of a fairy tale, Cassavetes says; it's dedicated to all the people who didn't marry the person they should have. It is a movie on the side of love, and it is one of the finest movies of the year.\n",
        "A narrative that tries to juggle thriller elements, tons of pop culture imagery, and way too much philosophical baggage.\n",
        "Ultimately, it seems more bland than bad.\n",
        "The Beach, designed to provoke audiences, stops for too many Hollywood moments to get the job done.\n",
        "The Beach is beautiful, everyone has a lovely tan. But it's nothing to write home about.\n",
        "All the beauty in the world can't camouflage the movie's gorgeous emptiness.\n",
        "It's Beach Blanket Bingo revisited, but with a Eurocast and more exotic locations.\n",
        "A seriously confused film that makes three or four passes at being a better one and doesn't complete any of them.\n",
        "A dark, muddled, ambitious but derivative piece.\n",
        "The film does not aspire to sociology. It just wants to tell a story. And that it does well.\n",
        "Its narrative waters become rather muddy in the late going, and its currents finally don't run very deep.\n",
        "The movie is an experience, of a sort they had a name for in the '60s: bummer.\n",
        "The Beach wears its self-importance on its sleeve, but never truly earns it.\n",
        "The movie feels like a mixed-up collection of high points from a book.\n",
        "Structured for an audience more familiar with MTV's Road Rules than with Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness.\n",
        "A movie that tries to take us from heaven to hell but winds up leaving us in limbo: exasperated and dumfounded.\n",
        "Tedious and unsatisfying.\n",
        "Snow Day fails both as arrested-development farce and as teen-age romantic comedy.\n",
        "Snow Day is an uninspired assembly of characters and story lines.\n",
        "Young Grey is a firecracker of talent; Fisk delivers a lovely, unaffected performance, and Chriqui is a sparkling, doe-eyed beauty.\n",
        "Not a waste of time, but not quite in control of its destination.\n",
        "Chase is so dull in this film, he looks as if he's sleepwalking.\n",
        "A zippy, irreverent time-filler.\n",
        "Casting any movie for kids with both Elliott and Chevy Chase is the cinematic equivalent of child abuse.\n",
        "The whole film seems pretty plastic, as if written by a computer.\n",
        "One of those low-intelligence pictures aimed squarely at the under-11 crowd that doesn't do much to endear itself to older viewers.\n",
        "Gentle but funny family comedy.\n",
        "Most of the material in the movie is so familiar it makes your teeth itch.\n",
        "Unless you have a craving to watch a sluggish Ski-Doo race or want to admire Chase dressed as a hula dancer, consider this the cinematic equivalent of yellow snow.\n",
        "Snow Day isn't for teens, it's for the kids who aspire to be teens.\n",
        "When it comes to Pooh stories, a shortage of ambition and reluctance to improve on success should be counted as assets.\n",
        "The Tigger Movie falls short of recent children's animated features.\n",
        "A conflicted entertainment, compromised by trying too hard to impress the restless, self-referential adults in the audience.\n",
        "A pale imitation of the original Winnie the Pooh Disney shorts of the '60s.\n",
        "The magical world of Pooh is always delightful to watch, even through a dirty lens.\n",
        "The songs seem to have been written over lunch at the Disney cafeteria.\n",
        "The story isn't a grabber.\n",
        "The dialogue is kid-level funny and the animation often has the manic energy of Alice in Wonderland.\n",
        "Anybody who first saw Tigger and learned the wonderful things about him more than 20 years ago is going to feel great, as will the very young who have been raised on Pooh and Co., one of the few cartoons that avoids hostility and violence.\n",
        "Even though the animation is still sharp, the writing is flat.\n",
        "In spite of its shortcomings, children love these characters and will enjoy Tigger.\n",
        "One of the movie's strengths is the score by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.\n",
        "There's something about The Tigger Movie that exemplifies the subpar state of movies today.\n",
        "The movie is so refreshingly subtle and sweet compared to other recent Disney features.\n",
        "Cute.\n",
        "Parents and older siblings, however, may grow impatient with the uneven execution that weakens the genuine charm the film sporadically exhibits.\n",
        "An engaging romp.\n",
        "This Tigger outing feels more like an overblown TV special than a grand theatrical release.\n",
        "Delightful songs and good cheer.\n",
        "This thematic 'lesson' is served up with non-didactic grace complemented by tiny bursts of humour.\n",
        "For Chinese viewers, this film will play as a human drama. For Western viewers, there's almost equal interest at the edges of the screen, in the background, in the locations and incidental details that show daily life in today's China.\n",
        "With Not One Less, Zhang Yimou has fashioned what feels like an uncannily accurate portrait of a culture where Communist ideology has vanished like a brief dream, as traditional community values clash with the burgeoning cult of money.\n",
        "Despite its deliberate austerity, Not One Less is extraordinarily rich.\n",
        "The Chinese director Zhang Yimou has a rare gift for dramatizing highly theatrical stories in highly naturalistic settings.\n",
        "Small movie, big impact.\n",
        "It's an excellent movie for kids, because it is about how amazing children can be.\n",
        "This film may seem slow, and its concerns distant to many American viewers. But Not One Less is a movie whose humanity is irresistibly, even joyfully, accessible.\n",
        "It is done with grim melodramatics that are hard-hitting despite a rambling, not-too-credible plot, and is cut out to order for the meller fan who likes his action rough and raw.\n",
        "Where the usual noir takes place in a nightmare world, this one seems to inhabit a dream: there's no longer fear in the images, but rather a distanced, idealized beauty.\n",
        "A sputtering, misguided antique.\n",
        "Terrific gangster movie.\n",
        "Brisk, richly characterized fiction that cuts as deeply and truly as any documentary.\n",
        "Without ever mentioning politics, Loach makes the most powerful and effective of political statements -- one that relies on subtlety and the intelligence of the audience.\n",
        "Gripping and sadly true to life.\n",
        "The film is good-hearted and the characters are easy to identify with, but what I liked best was the underlying humor, even in this desperate situation.\n",
        "Even the weak moments are saved by Poitier, who invests his role with a subtle warmth.\n",
        "Sidney Poitier stars in an excellent performance.\n",
        "Incessant Cockney street market vignettes and shots of London buses seem to suggest that it was all primarily intended for American consumption anyway.\n",
        "A cozy, good-humored and unbelievable little tale.\n",
        "Well-meaning tripe.\n",
        "Turns of dialogue ring compellingly true, and the well chosen cast (especially Ribisi) carry the inflections of the drama with some style.\n",
        "To put the movie in sales terms, after a good opening pitch, Younger fails to close the deal. The audience can't buy in.\n",
        "Last reel is particularly disappointing in its naive philosophy, manifest in Younger's rush to bring the various conflicts to satisfying closure.\n",
        "Writer-director Ben Younger experienced the sales pitch of a boiler room recruiter in real life. His fascination with the thrill-junkie life of these stock jocks is reflected in the script's sharp, arrogant dialogue.\n",
        "During the movie I was wound up with tension and involvement.\n",
        "Boiler's adrenaline rush film creates an elaborate stock scam.\n",
        "It's the first film of the year capable of keeping a grown-up awake.\n",
        "A compelling movie-going experience.\n",
        "Younger draws a lot from David Mamet in his depictions of this seller's hothouse, but he does it with a twist: The salesmen here are fully conscious of being Mamet-y; their bible is Alec Baldwin's big, win-at-all-costs speech from...Glengarry Glen Ross.\n",
        "A fast and funny look at a world where 'greed is good' has become the only reality in town.\n",
        "The movie draws from the works that preceded it, then takes to the street with a too-cool hip-hop strut.\n",
        "In moviemaking, as in cold-calling, sometimes conviction is almost enough.\n",
        "Boiler Room is derivative and flawed. But it does throw off a few sparks.\n",
        "You won't find a movie that taps more directly into the jugular of the greed-fueled late '90s.\n",
        "Boiler Room is a new film that will yank anyone who's ever gotten a cold call from a chop shop.\n",
        "What cooks about Boiler Room are the details, the ways these guys talk to each other and customers.\n",
        "Despite Ribisi's success in giving Seth some sleepy-eyed, slouching charisma, we never really know what makes him tick.\n",
        "Boiler Room reflects the sensibility of the generation it holds up to critical scrutiny, and it's a cunningly ambiguous act of self-portraiture.\n",
        "Younger has a firmer grasp on the convoluted workings of pop and business (sub) cultures than many of his contemporaries.\n",
        "Boiler Room pays off with emotional dividends well worth the time investment.\n",
        "A smart, suspenseful sci-fi movie from director Twohy, whose underrated 1996 film, The Arrival, also brought visual imagination and intelligence to the genre.\n",
        "The script is a compendium of science-fiction cliches, familiar in Hollywood movies since the early fifties.\n",
        "The film works because it's strong on fundamentals: fear of the dark, fear of helplessness, fear of the unknown, and fear of unpredictable human behavior.\n",
        "Pitch Black is one of those annoyingly noisy outer-space thrillers where you can't figure out the characters' names at first, and when you finally do, they are either dead or you hate them.\n",
        "In the movie's last hour, writer-director David Twohy pretends to explore his stick figures' moral choices, and he forgets to deliver the thrills.\n",
        "Pitch Black is the movie of the season for sci-fi and horror fans!\n",
        "A step backward from The Arrival.\n",
        "A mediocre but nonetheless entertaining copy of the Alien films.\n",
        "Dumb, direct and derivative.\n",
        "Director and co-writer David Twohy has stolen from so many other movies in order to cobble together the paltry Pitch Black.\n",
        "It's not an especially challenging part, but Diesel handles it with aplomb.\n",
        "Pitch Black is so jaunty, so limber, and so visually self-assured that art peeks through where crap has traditionally made its home.\n",
        "Barely intermittent, reminding us that the B-movie is still very much with us.\n",
        "The screenplay, credited to Twohy with Jim and Ken Wheat, for a scary movie hasn't a scary idea on any of its pages.\n",
        "Decent, suspenseful entertainment.\n",
        "A routine sci-fi/horror action-adventure, takes us where we've been countless times before.\n",
        "Proving that low-budget genre-based entertainment can be just as easily ferociously inventive and character-driven as its big-budget competition can be lazy and boring.\n",
        "A tiresome experience.\n",
        "[David Twohy] tweaks this formulaic escape-from-hell story with just enough original touches to give it a lift.\n",
        "It's so plot heavy it never finds its nimble comic rhythm.\n",
        "A subtle but unmistakable aura of jolliness sneaks from the screen during The Whole Nine Yards.\n",
        "Director Jonathan Lynn keeps a loose rein on the nuttiness but never lets it get out of bounds and maintains the film's comic buoyancy throughout.\n",
        "It's laugh-out-loud, side-splitting funny.\n",
        "Much of the film's 'charm' comes from the affection the characters have for each other.\n",
        "The Whole Nine Yards ends up on the undernourished side.\n",
        "The more frenzied the action gets, the duller the film becomes.\n",
        "The picture also allows its female leads to show their considerable stuff.\n",
        "Wacky and heartless.\n",
        "Yards is underwhelming.\n",
        "The Whole Nine Yards a bright crowd-pleaser with a clever script.\n",
        "It produces some laughs.\n",
        "Director Jonathan Lynn keeps the comedy rolling smoothly.\n",
        "Inventively examines bigotry, combining daring humor and hyperbole, dark realism and shining idealism.\n",
        "The underlying secret of the four comedians is the way they find humor in daily life, and in their families.\n",
        "A well-crafted concert film that should delight fans and attract new ones.\n",
        "This ensemble stand-up movie does have its moments.\n",
        "Although the comedy is, to say the least, less edgy than that of The Original Kings of Comedy, there are some solid laughs among the crowd-pleasing bathroom gags.\n",
        "The jokes are witty and universal enough for everyone.\n",
        "They couch their humor in a genuinely warm aura, proudly stripped of any edge or hipness.\n",
        "Unlikely to draw new fans but destined to please followers who couldn't catch the live act.\n",
        "You don't need to own a pickup truck or know how to use the word 'aorta' in a sentence ... in order to appreciate the amiable humor.\n",
        "Dillon does a good job in his fullest, least narcissistic characterization to date.\n",
        "The performances compensate, with Dillon turning in a light and touching portrait of confused ambitions.\n",
        "Dillon is a revelation in this movie.\n",
        "Even if The Flamingo Kid comes out of sit-com country, the character and the performance effortlessly rise above their origins.\n",
        "Professionally made, quite entertaining, and disappointingly hollow.\n",
        "Frankenheimer ... treats this trashy, disreputable material with a brute squareness so leaden and dour it's practically Teutonic.\n",
        "Watchable but sometimes quite ludicrous.\n",
        "A pileup of impossible-to-believe situations that just keep getting worse with every line uttered by anyone who happens to be on screen.\n",
        "It just vanishes from between your ears like cotton-candy in a tropical rainstorm, leaving nothing but a slightly sickly aftertaste.\n",
        "It's a heist without a plan, a crime without a brain, a thriller without a decent script.\n",
        "The end is a long time coming in Reindeer Games and the dialogue is mostly slush.\n",
        "I wish I'd had a stopwatch, to clock how many minutes are spent while one character holds a gun to another character's head and gabs.\n",
        "The games it plays are more ambitious than successful.\n",
        "Narratively, the movie is similar to a casino game: you're not sure where you are and the house has the advantage.\n",
        "About as appealing as leftover Christmas fruitcake.\n",
        "A mechanical exercise from the get-go.\n",
        "Reindeer Games is too tricky to let the audience join the fun.\n",
        "The movie is often amusing, thanks to Affleck's excellent deadpan delivery of flippant lines in the face of loaded guns and to Sinise's scenery-chewing villain.\n",
        "Frankenheimer does make Reindeer Games a bigger experience than it might have been in anyone else's hands.\n",
        "Gets lost in a blizzard of cliches and uneven performances.\n",
        "Michael Douglas gives the best perfromance of his career (to be remembered at Oscar time) in this screwball comedy about a college professor who's pushed into maturity by forces beyond his control; a well-acted coming-of-age saga for adults.\n",
        "Wonder Boys digresses so entertainingly, you forget how quickly Grady got into the mess he's in, and can't imagine where we might be headed.\n",
        "Get going, you laggards.\n",
        "Wonder Boys is like a George Cukor movie with a bad head cold -- slow, muffled and vague.\n",
        "It's an often-wondrous comedy, just as rich and surprising as L.A. Confidential but considerably less dark.\n",
        "I don't think I've ever seen another American comedy that mixed rue and slapstick and sentiment in quite this way.\n",
        "After enduring a lot of jokes about May-December romances, Douglas comes bouncing back with one of his best performances.\n",
        "Glad to have been invited along.\n",
        "[Curtis Hanson] so intent on getting us to like his characters that he didn't give them enough juice.\n",
        "The material throughout is so fresh.\n",
        "[Michael Douglas] is a superb comic actor, one who knows that the secret of being funny is never begging for a laugh.\n",
        "McDormand is as much a delight to watch as she's ever been.\n",
        "World-weary has never been funnier or more fascinating than in Kloves' hands.\n",
        "Funny and touching.\n",
        "While Maguire's blank shapelessness has left a hole in the center of other films, here he delivers a real performance rather than just his wide-eyed presence.\n",
        "This is certainly the best studio movie of the new year to date, and Douglas might even be remembered at next year's Oscars.\n",
        "Tobey Maguire continues his winning streak, showing his comedic versatility this time around.\n",
        "With vivid characters, an ironic voice-over narrative, and a solidly written screenplay, Wonder Boys provides its share of small pleasures...\n",
        "I got caught up in the global chess game, in the bluffing and the dares, the dangerous strategy of using nuclear blackmail against a fanatic who might call the bluff.\n",
        "The film begins and ends with footage of FDR intoning \"I hate war,\" something the film takes two interminable hours to say.\n",
        "One of the pleasures of Deterrence is that it does not tell the audience what to think.\n",
        "The talk grows tired while the tension, alas, barely grows at all. And the ending is a cheat, pure and simple.\n",
        "Deterrence does serve up some wonderfully chewy pulp during its generally engaging 101 minutes, along with a certain vagueness of point-of-view.\n",
        "It may be a little too dour, a little too self-inflated.\n",
        "The material exhibits too many flaws to be regarded as anything more substantial than an interesting failure.\n",
        "The plot twists fall about as weightily as the fake snow.\n",
        "Having Deterrence unfold on a single set only adds to the film's artificiality.\n",
        "A very effective updating of the underrated Cold War thriller Fail-Safe.\n",
        "Relies much too heavily on multiple repetitions of gags that aren't especially funny the first time around.\n",
        "A second-string effort.\n",
        "Unoriginal and insulting, 3 Strikes goes down without scoring a single chuckle.\n",
        "Pooh wastes a wonderful cast.\n",
        "Designed for a lowest-common-denominator audience segment.\n",
        "A sloppy hash of a movie, poorly directed and plotted in a way that looks as if it were improvised on the spot.\n",
        "Pooh's 3 Strikes aims a good deal higher in concept than, say, your average booty movie - but the crude, witless jokes are on exactly that level.\n",
        "A giddy farce with sporadic laughs and no staying power.\n",
        "In 3 Strikes, empty jokes hang heavy, and you may find yourself fanning the air much as Uncle Jim's family does when the old coot lets one rip.\n",
        "Dumb and sloppy.\n",
        "Sophomoric and unfunny.\n",
        "Butt-numbingly dull and almost entirely laugh-free.\n",
        "Drowning Mona takes a fresh and funny spin on the classic mystery plot in which someone is so universally loathed that practically everyone is a credible suspect.\n",
        "My problem was that I didn't care who killed Mona Dearly, or why.\n",
        "Drowning Mona is a funny comedy for about 90 seconds.\n",
        "The film is monumentally minor -- you'll hardly remember you saw it a week later.\n",
        "I find it hard to dislike.\n",
        "Disappointingly tame (and often lame) comedy that consistently misses opportunities to do something clever or inventive.\n",

        "[Gomez] extracts potent comedy from the material's more outrageous situations and displays a sure hand with his talented cast.\n",
        "No kind of triumph of anything over anything.\n",

        "Too pleased with its own outrageousness.\n",
        "Either they had something on [Nick Gomez] or he needed the money.\n",
        "A backwoods slapstick that lacks the anarchy needed for true farce.\n",
        "Mona, a screenplay dripping with contempt, gives its cast enough rope and enough bad jokes to make you feel seriously sorry for all of them.\n",
        "The cars are the funniest thing in the movie. And really, they're not all that funny.\n",
        "Mona is a dreary crash of malapropisms and slapstick maimings wrapped very loosely around a murder mystery.\n",
        "Sitting in the theater watching this crap, it's impossible not to wonder why one bothered to go at all.\n",
        "Fierce appeal and beautifully wrought wit.\n",

        "[Madonna] can barely muster even the rudiments of human expression.\n",
        "The moment the movie loses its lighthearted spirit is the moment it loses touch with reality.\n",
        "A pleasing but mindless diversion that goes down well with buttered popcorn and a large Coke.\n",
        "A well-intended but confused serio-comedy that flakes out on its central characters.\n",
        "A dismal film.\n",
        "A dreary little journey that starts as a cutesy sitcom and nosedives into leaden soap opera.\n",
        "Never having decided whether it wants to be comedy or a sentimental hand-wringer, it tries to be both and winds up being neither.\n",
        "Madonna never emerges as a plausible human being in the movie; she's more like a spokeswoman for a video on alternative parenting lifestyles.\n",
        "There hasn't been a Hollywood 'message' movie as smug or cheesy as The Next Best Thing in quite a while.\n",
        "She's awful. But to be fair, so is everything else about the movie.\n",
        "It means to speak to raw, complex emotions, but it looks so ridiculously glossy you can never suspend disbelief.\n",
        "It's sort of like two baseball teams going out to the parking lot to play the ninth inning of a tied ballgame, then coming back onto the field to announce the score.\n",
        "This movie wants to be sweet and dark at the same time, but it is as distant as a planet's satellite.\n",
        "Bogs down in weak dramaturgy about love and commitment.\n",
        "Bottom line, this is American Pie for boys-will -be- boys in the fiftysomething age range.\n",
        "Bening, even in a formula role like this one, is so lovable she actually makes you believe that she'd melt the resolve of a technocratic space visitor.\n",
        "If you're expecting humor of the Sanders quality here, you won't get it, nor will you find that Shandling has a wide enough range as an actor.\n",
        "The only eruption this movie evokes is a loud yawn.\n",
        "A film whose tone is out of sync with the simple, ribald conceit and is only mildly amusing at best.\n",
        "Easily the funniest movie of the year.\n",
        "Has a lot of jokes that register intellectually, but rarely does it poke you in a place where you can't help but squeal.\n",
        "How did smart people of proven talent make such a lame movie?\n",
        "Whatever planet produced this sex comedy, it's not indicating many signs of intelligent life.\n",
        "Shandling and director Mike Nichols find a funny new way of packaging the old truth in What Planet Are You From?\n",
        "Diverting.\n",
        "It's amazing that a movie with so many sex jokes can turn out to be so unfunny.\n",
        "Thirteen year-old boys would love the film if they could get into this R-rated picture.\n",
        "If you're making a movie about a man who has a strange noise coming from his pants, you should cast an actor who looks different when it isn't.\n",
        "Documentaries are almost always more interesting if the filmmakers fess up about their relationship to the subject, as unabashed pro-wrestling fan Barry Blaustein does in this naively made, compelling homage to the sport.\n",
        "A gently and genuinely observed film whose subject is a garish, artificial display of mayhem.\n",
        "We tour the All-Pro Wrestling School in California and Philadelphia's fearsome Extreme Championships, but it's the studies Blaustein makes of several wrestlers that root the film.\n",
        "Entertaining and twisted.\n",
        "Blaustein's documentary about championship wrestling is as voyeuristic, artificial and perversely compelling as the sport itself.\n",
        "Beyond the Mat wants to blend thrills and pathos, getting at the many sides of what is, as Mr. Blau stein describes it, a carny act. The problem is that he doesn't articulate any of his own thoughts beyond a few slight asides.\n",
        "Beyond the Mat is crazily entertaining.\n",
        "Blaustein suggests wrestling's appeal -- as a kind of primal spectacle closer to parades and pageants than any accepted form of sport -- without wondering at all why he finds it compelling.\n",
        "Beyond the Mat transcends its subject, pro wrestling, to become a wrenching, sobering, emotional glimpse at the lives of some men trapped by the aging process.\n",
        "The rampant hucksterism of big-time wrestling is in a long American tradition, and Beyond the Mat is a very smart first step in opening the subject up to clearer view.\n",
        "Beyond the Mat does what the wrestling game, with its manufactured personas, doesn't. It stays with the wrestlers until we start seeing them as people.\n",
        "Friendly, soft-hitting documentary.\n",
        "Beyond the Mat takes all the fun out of the insanity that is wrestling.\n",
        "Funny and touching documentary.\n",
        "It has a hypnotic quality.\n",
        "The wrestlers are cannier than Blaustein probably gives them credit for; they seem to be offering up their backstage lives to him in ways that mimic the soppiest of melodramas, and he falls for it.\n",
        "It's the most entertaining look at its world since Pumping Iron took on body-building.\n",
        "So tired and dated.\n",
        "It grabs professional wrestling by the throat and rarely lets go.\n",
        "At once a tribute to traditional notions of honour, loyalty, friendship and professionalism, and a stylish, ironic pastiche inspired by the likes of Melville and Suzuki, it's very funny, insightful, and highly original.\n",
        "A handsomely shot, cool-sounding head-scratcher of a film that probably isn't worth the wear on the fingernails.\n",
        "Too whimsically staged to take as serious suspense, too grimly real to be amusing.\n",
        "Hypnotic and quietly subversive.\n",
        "Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai brings the minimalist director who found fame with 1984's Stranger Than Paradise back to the land of the living.\n",
        "Ghost Dog is an impeccably shot and sensationally scored deadpan parody of two current popular modes -- the hit-man glorification saga and the Cosa Nostra family drama.\n",
        "By turns irritating and inviting; Jarmusch's allusive metaphysics has a sensual glide, but much of what he's doing here is also too, too hip.\n",
        "Jarmusch has introduced historical references ... that have opened up his imagination and extended his thematic and affective range well beyond that of his first five features.\n",
        "Rueful, funny, deliciously off-kilter.\n",
        "A gem of a movie!\n",
        "Dryly funny and important.\n",
        "A self-conscious but surprisingly entertaining fusion of gangster, martial-arts and western movies.\n",
        "Only the most ardent Jarmusch fan will be able to suspend disbelief, and the movie turns into an exercise in ideas rather than an excursion along a stable narrative route.\n",
        "compellingly strange twist on the mafia genre\n",
        "Fascinating but uneven.\n",
        "Ghost Dog is muddled and aimless.\n",
        "Ghost Dog is... a delight for those who know his work, maybe a mystery for those who don't.\n",
        "By the end, Whitaker's character has generated true poignance.\n",
        "A complicated film that never really successfully yokes together the themes of money-making and sexuality, it reveals both Kazan's operatic sensibility and his inability to follow an argument rigorously through.\n",
        "Robert Aldrich's \"daring\" 1968 mating of lesbianism and commerce was, as I recall, considered pretty tame even then; lord knows what it looks like today.\n",
        "A little windy and rhetorical for my taste, but still one of John Huston's best efforts.\n",
        "Emphasis is on tension in the telling, and effective use of melodramatic mood has been used to point up the suspense.\n",
        "Although the characters are basically stereotypes, they are lent the gift of life by a superlative cast.\n",
        "The script prepared by Mr. Huston and Richard Brooks was too full of words and highly cross-purposed implications to give the action full chance.\n",
        "Disturbing and affecting.\n",
        "Claustrophobic and overwrought, Jailbait is an unpleasant excursion into gay panic mitigated somewhat by performances that are hard to shake.\n",
        "While the stars deliver highly committed performances, the static nature of the proceedings ultimately defeats them.\n",
        "A stagy, only mildly compelling prison drama that ends up feeling like purgatory to all involved.\n",
        "I wouldn't have thought it was possible to make a prison picture as utterly boring as Jailbait.\n",
        "The cruelty of the law has been better demonstrated with news stories, and unless you're a Californian with two strikes against you, I don't know why you'd want to do this movie to yourself.\n",
        "... the umpteenth prison drama to focus on the lurid threat of forced submission.\n",
        "Mr. Peckinpah's least interesting, least personal film in years, a hysterically elaborate, made-in-Yugoslavia war spectacle, the work of international financiers and a multinational cast.\n",
        "George Cukor directed, a little impersonally for him.\n",
        "Magic.\n",
        "More firm in its social implications than ever it was on the stage and blessed with a priceless performance by rocketing Judy Holliday, this beautifully integrated compound of character study and farce made a resounding entry at the Victoria yesterday.\n",
        "Belying the lightheartedness of its title, Birdy is a heavy adult drama about best friends and the after-effects of war, but it takes too long to live up to its ambitious premise.\n",
        "A trifle self-indulgent -- well, it is directed by Alan Parker -- but never boring\n",
        "A very strange and beautiful movie.\n",
        "Most of Birdy is enchanting.\n",
        "We can't recommend this little item as a sample of the best in Gallic films. It is clumsily put together and rather bizarrely played.\n",
        "Ballard and his masterly crew of film makers have reimagined a corner of the natural world...They leave us awed.\n",
        "Measures up to the promise Ballard amply provided in his first feature, The Black Stallion.\n",
        "For the most part very absorbing, the film suffers from some embarrassingly obvious symbolism.\n",
        "Perhaps the best thing about the film is that the wolves are never made to seem like strange but cuddly dogs. They look like wolves, not especially threatening but still remote and complete unto themselves.\n",
        "The film is still memorable for its compassion, commitment, and unexpected humor, qualities that go a long way toward tempering the ecological didacticism of the screenplay.\n",
        "It does have enough gritty insights and (for the time) strikingly accurate production details to keep the level of interest up.\n"
