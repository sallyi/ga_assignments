Under "algorithms," pick one link and read through the text. in a markdown file, write up the following:

1. What was the name of the algorithm you read about?
  Decision Tree

2. What data problem does it solve? (listed under Technique on previous page)
  Classification

3. In layman's terms, what does the algorithm do? Even if you aren't sure, that's okay! Just try your best--we're not looking for perfect answers.
  The algorithm asks a series of yes or no questions about the certain attributes of the data. The data is divided up into subsets based off of these questions, and at each subset (or node in the branch of the tree) the algorithm then calculates the probability of a given answer to an earlier question posed about the data. 

4. Come up with up to three applications of this algorithm in business. Try relating it to your own job or line of work, your other data interests, or what have you.
  1. For information retrieval systems - based off of a number of features/attributes of documents, will a given document be relevant to what the user is looking for?
  2. Recommendation systems - based off of customer data (previous purchases, demographic info), will a given customer want to buy something?
  3. Calculating the probability of a drug that is being tested having side effects in particular sets of people.
