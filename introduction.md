2. I work at Bloomberg in Princeton. I've been working primarily in data extraction/information retrieval (in natural language and semistructured texts) for the past few years, but I am now starting a new role as a "Social Networking Data Scientist." I use a lottt of regex in python right now.
3. Interested in entity recognition (spefically information about people and companies), using natural language processing of news and SEC documents. 
4. I want to learn how extract information in a less deterministic way than I have been. I don't have a strong background in math or statistics and would like to start figuring out how to incorporate these methods into my job. I would also like to learn more analysis, I frequently just code without doing a lot of analysis first.
