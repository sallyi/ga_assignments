#### Overall comments
* I like the cleanup you did on the cuisine category a lot, also the cleanup on grade.
* It's interesting to look at the ratings by borough. I wonder if you could look at food score by food origin by borough? Might be hard to visualize.
* It could be interesting to normalize the violation type and see if there are patterns in certain regions (for example more rats in a certain area) or cetain food types (it looks like there is some sort of transfat violiation that could be more common in different cuisines than others).
* Would be a lot more work but could look at yelp data and see how the reviews correlate with health score / violations.
